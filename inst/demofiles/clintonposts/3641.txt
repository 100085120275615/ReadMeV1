<div>There is a Register story today on <strong>Governor Vilsack's</strong> whopping $400,000 raised for his 527! Yes its a 527, not a PAC as the press continues to report. You can read past writings by PI here: <a href="http://politicsiniowa.blogspot.com/2006/02/just-to-be-fair.html">

<strong>Vilsack PAC raises $400,600 in 3 months</strong>

<em>Unlike federal political action committees, which are bound by Federal Election Commission rules, 527s are organized under IRS rules and are allowed to accept corporate contributions.</em>
<br />
<br />Why abide by rules when going around them is so much more fun. Just ask <strong>Ramona</strong>.<br />
<br />
<em>"We're pleased with the report because it demonstrates we've been able to raise the resources to support Democratic candidates for governor and other stateside offices," spokeswoman Kiki McLean said. "We're meeting our goals to execute our plans."</em>
<br />
<br />Wait...<br />
<br />Okay, sorry we had scotch blowing out our noses because we couldn't stop laughing. Since the Register did such a tremendous job at covering the facts of this money we thought we'd dig a little deeper than just printing the press release and give everyone a few meaty details.<br />
<br />Fact: <strong>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton</strong> raised over $6 million dollars (yes, that's 6,000,000) this past quarter without corporate contributions and within FEC limits.<br />
<br />FACT: <strong>Governor "Big Pay" Vilsack</strong> as we call him because he pays quasi government officials so well raised a whopping $172,371 from individuals and a lot of it not within FEC limits. This is less than <strong>Ramona Cunningham</strong> made in a year and includes another $50,000 from his good buddy Bill Knapp. He raised another$228,278 from Unions and businesses. This includes another $100,000 from <strong>AFSCME. </strong>That is a big, wet thank you kiss on his rosy red cheeks for bypassing the legislative process, screwing the SEIU and helping AFSCME unionize daycare providers.<br />
<br />So let's review. HRC raises over 6 million from individuals to add to her stunning overall number, all transferable and legal to spend in a presidential race. T"BP"V raises just over $400,000 most he's not able to spend.<br />
<br />For all that travel and time away from Iowa, things sure don't seem to be paying off for Tom.<br />
