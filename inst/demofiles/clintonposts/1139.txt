Not surprisingly, this is largely the same group of super-annuated, weed-smoking 1960s flower children who believed firmly that the Sovs were a peaceful crowd of agrarians forced to build up enormous stockpiles of ICBMs by U.S. capitalism, imperialism, colonialism and what-not.<br /><br />I know where I fit.
