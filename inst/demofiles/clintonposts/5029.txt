<span>Since I am hocking numerous people (and you Styx readers) about the Democratic Party, I should try to come up with analysis and research related to the big enchilada: the 2008 Election.<br /><br />True, November 2006 is still in the future, and that will factor heavily into the calculations, especially on the GOP side.<br /><br />What I hope to do in the coming weeks is analyze the possible candidates for 2008, using the two most important tools available to mankind: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_United_States_Presidental_Election">The Wiki</a> and <a href="http://youtube.com/results?search=Hillary+Clinton&search_type=search_videos">YouTube</a>.<br /><br />The reason why such analysis is necessary is this question: "who had heard of William Jefferson Clinton in 1990"?
