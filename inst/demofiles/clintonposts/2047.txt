<br />Bye-bye, Joe: now Hillaryâs the target<br />Sarah Baxter, Washington<br />
<br />THE defeat of Joe Lieberman, the most hawkish senator in the Democratic party, by an anti-war political novice in a primary election in Connecticut last week was a spectacular coup for the ânetrootsâ: the grassroots, anti-establishment, anti-war left that had mobilised opposition on the internet to the political grandee.<br />
<br />The same activists are now seeking to bend Senator Hillary Clinton to their anti-war side or face defeat in the Democratic presidential primaries. Her supporters are concerned that the âjihadistâ left, galvanised by the victory of East Coast millionaire Ned Lamont, are on the rise in the Democratic party, starkly affecting its national electoral prospects.<br />
<br />Mike McCurry, White House press secretary during Bill Clintonâs presidency, said: âThe very idea of centrism is under attack now in the party. We have our own loony left too.â<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Calling those opposed to the war in Iraq "jihadist" left is outrageous.  The fact that they pull out a quote from Mike McCurry prior to the war and use it out of context is also pathetic.</strong>
<br />
<strong></strong>
<br />
<strong>The fact of the matter is that ALL of those who voted to get us into this war were wrong. Hell, I was wrong for believing that some of those who voted for the war did so naively trusting George Bush.</strong>
<br />
<strong></strong>
<br />
<strong>Many, not only in the Democratic Party now understand that this war was wrong and those who are elected better heed the warning against incumbency and the status quo.  I would say to them, it is not too late to change your views, and I would highly recommend it in regards to this war.</strong>
