Hero of Democrats?</a>: "NEW YORK An interview in this Sunday's New York Times Magazine with C.C. Goldwater reveals that her HBO film to be aired Sept. 18 paints her late grandfather, Sen. Barry Goldwater, 'as a kind of liberal,' with testimonials from Al Franken, Sen. Ted Kennedy, James Carville and Sen. Hillary Clinton.<br />
<br />In fact, Hillary campaigned for Goldwater in 1964 in his race for president against Lyndon Johnson. 'Hillary was a Goldwater girl,' says the filmmaker, interviewed by Deborah Solomon. 'She passed out cookies and lemonade at his campaign functions.' "</div>
