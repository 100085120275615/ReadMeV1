This book exposes liberals like Michael Moore, Al Franken, John Kerry, Teddy Kennedy, Koward Dean, Jimmy Carter, Al Gore, Bill and Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, Al Sharpton, Cindy Sheehan etc., who are all ruining this great country as we know it. Goldberg  writes only a page or two about each person, and makes compelling arguments for the inclusion of each person on his list. A MUST READ for all who are fed up with the anti-American liberalism of today.<br />
