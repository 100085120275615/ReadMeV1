<div><p>One of my Republican neighbors thought it would be funny to send this story to me.  I donât know who the author is, but Iâm willing to bet itâs some yahoo, hill-billy whoâs never opened a book since 8th grade.  Iâve corrected the grammar for him before posting.  Below you can read my response.  Enjoy. </p>

<p>THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER</p>

<p>CLASSIC VERSION:<br />
The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. Grasshopper has no food or shelter so he dies out in the cold.<br />

MODERN VERSION:<br />
The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up<br />
supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant<br />
should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.<br />
CBS, NBC and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast.<br />
			                                     <br />
How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer? Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when they sing "It's Not Easy Being Green."<br />
Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where the news stations film the group singing "We shall overcome". Jesse then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.<br />
Al Gore exclaims in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share".</p>

<p>Finally, the EOC drafts the "Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act," retroactive to the beginning of the summer.  The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and,having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.</p>

<p>Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients. The ant loses the case.<br />
			                                     <br />
The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bit of the ant's food, while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he doesn't maintain it.</p>

<p>The ant has disappeared in the snow. The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood.</p>

<p>MORAL OF THE STORY:  VOTE REPUBLICAN<br />

<p>Now after youâve finished throwing up and asking yourself, "How can any American be so STUPID?" read my response to this yahoo, hill-billy:</p>

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER<br />
THE VERSION BUSH DOESNâT WANT US TO KNOW<br />
by Kellen Wilson</p>

<p>If this were truly a fable where the ant was a Republican it would go more like this: First of all, you don't believe that the ant would be doing any hard work, do you?  All hard work would be done by the grasshopper. And at a very low wage, I might add.  You see, the Republican ant busted up the grasshopper union leaving the grasshopper to work at a much lower wage. This means that the mother grasshopper has to work just to bring in the same salary that the father grasshopper used to bring in alone. Then one day the Republican ant decides that even without the unions, wages were still too high and things like health insurance and safety regulations for his workers were eating into his profits and bonus packages, so he decides to move his anthill across the border where he can get Mexican beetles to do the work for dung.<br />
Across the border the Republican ant is free to plunder the resources of another country and reap wild profits without having to worry about such foolish things as living wages, laws to protect the environment, safety regulations and child labor laws.  This, of course, leaves the grasshopper without any meaningful work and he is forced into degrading service work ("would you like fries with that caterpillar, sir?") or playing the lottery. Some can't find work at all and end up homeless or sometimes the grasshopper feels hopeless and turns to drugs or crime, but that's okay, too because now the ant has more contracts to reward some of his biggest campaign donors in the flourishing new prison industrial complex industry. But wait, something's wrong. Even after moving his anthill across the border to exploit cheap labor and natural resources the ant is still losing money leg over claw. How can this be happening? After all, the ant is working the capitalist, free enterprise system full throttle, which means everything should be hunky-dory. Instead, the stock market is a free fall, 3 million jobs have been lost in the first 3 years under an ant administration, the economy is in a recession, the country is 2 trillion dollars in the hole, the states are broke, thereâs no money for schools or infrastructure, Veterans of Foreign Wars benefits, nor any other vital social program. Of course, none of this stops the ant from getting huge tax breaks. And you would think with all of the tax breaks, privatization, corporate welfare and deregulation the ant's businesses would be thriving, wouldn't you?  - You would be wrong. Because of mismanagement, corruption, malfeasance, and crooked Ponzi schemes the ant has run many multi-billion dollar corporations into the ground, screwed the grasshopper out of his life savings, stored the money away in offshore banking accounts and ran to Congress for a bailout, which will be paid with the grasshopper's taxes.  </p>

<p>MORAL OF THE STORY: REPUBLICANS HAVE NO MORALS.<br />
