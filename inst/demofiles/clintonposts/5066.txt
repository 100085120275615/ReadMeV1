U.S. forces, meanwhile, have lost nine soldiers since Saturday, the military said in press releases, making it a lethal weekends for them as well.

Last month, the Baghdad morgue received more than 1,800 bodies, a record high. This month, the morgue is on track to receive less than a quarter of that.<br />[...]<br />Though the U.S. military has not issued a timetable for ending the sweep, officials say that patrolling Baghdad indefinitely would create dependency among Iraq's nascent security forces and tax U.S. resources and manpower. The U.S. military, with 138,000 troops, is stretched thin in Iraq; many units are on their third deployments. Last week, the Pentagon announced an involuntary recall of as many as 2,500 Marines reservists. The Army has issued recall orders to 10,000 soldiers.

But with growing public anxiety about climate change, major corporations are increasingly preparing for -- and in some cases lobbying for -- Congress to regulate emissions of heat-trapping gases.<br /><br />The industry's response is evolving in spite of opposition by the Bush administration to limits on carbon dioxide.<br /><br />But businesses are reading the political tea leaves. Legislation to limit greenhouse gas emissions is gaining ground in Congress with members of both parties. States, especially California and those in the Northeast, are moving forward with climate-change regulations. Two likely presidential hopefuls for 2008 -- Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Democratic Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York -- have called for reining in greenhouse gases.

The Guardian reported Saturday on what is believed to be the world's largest study of seasonal events, such as the flowering of plants, autumnal leaves falling and insect behavior, that have caused scientists to believe that spring now arrives six-to-eight days earlier across Europe than it did in the early 1970s. And warmer temperatures have delayed autumn by an average of three days in the past 30 years.

Of the EU's 25 member states, only Greece and Portugal recycle a smaller proportion of their waste than Britain. The report by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) and Green Alliance, which revealed the EU league table, called on local authorities to be given powers to charge a "pay-as-you-throw" fee for collecting non-recyclable rubbish.

Such deterioration, the pontiff said during his traditional Sunday blessing, "make the lives of poor people on earth especially unbearable." Benedict remarked that the Italian Catholic Church has chosen Sept. 1 to celebrate it first Earth Day. "Along with Christians from all denominations, we must commit to taking care of creation, without squandering its resources and sharing them in a convivial manner," the pope said.

At the same time, the decision by many Democrats to refrain from advocating a specific plan for withdrawal complicates their leaders' efforts to convince voters that they offer a clear new direction for the increasingly unpopular war.

Benefits are also shrinking. "Although the economy continues to add jobs, global trade, immigration, layoffs and technologyâas well as the insecurity caused by themâappear to have eroded workers' bargaining power," the story says. Political analysts suggest that growing income inequality could create a favorable electoral climate for Democrats.
