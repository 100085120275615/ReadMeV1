There was once a scene in an episode of The Simpsons, in which a group of TV executives were sitting in a conference room, brainstorming thoughts  for a TV show.  And where did they go for inspiration?   "I've got an idea," One said,  "Turn to channel 4."<br /><br />Contrary to what you would hope would happen, that old stereotype of the entertainment industry is becoming coming truer by the day and the dollar.  I used to think it was just.... a stereotype, something extreme punk rockers say to be anti-establishment, and then I realized just how wrong I was.  They have seemingly just ran out of ideas and have begun recycling old ones or ideas they themselves didn't even come up with in the first place.  And recently they have apparently cranked up this hideous tactic by a multiple of 10. TV Shows seem to literally steal ideas from other programs, movie remakes are being cranked out like never before, and there is just a void where creative new ideas used to be. Is it out of laziness? Greed? Or has the entertainment industry become too much of just that, an industry (as if it wasn't before)? Or is it all of the above?<br /><br />The trend really hit a new level, at least in the TV world, around the time "Survivor" first came on the air and became the monster hit it was.  Within no time at all, you had countless "reality" knockoffs. And as time has progressed its spread and gotten even worse. The only thing distinguishing many of these reality shows from one another is the cast of characters. Even the setting occasionally is the same. The so called "reality craze" is full of nothing  but stolen ideas, unoriginal concepts,  and studios looking to make a fast buck.  A quick, and incomplete, list of a few recent reality shows:<br />*The Amazing Race<br />*American Idol<br />*America's Next Top Model<br />*Amish in The City<br />*The Anna Nicole Show<br />*The Apprentice<br />*Average Joe<br />*The Bachelor<br />*The Bachelorette<br />*Beauty and The Geek<br />*Being Bobby Brown<br />*The Benefactor<br />*Big Brother<br />*Boot Camp<br />*The Casino<br />*The Contender<br />*Extreme Makeover<br />*Hogan Knows Best<br />*The Family<br />*For Love Or Money<br />*Hell's Kitchen<br />*I Want To Be A Hilton<br />*Joe Millionaire<br />*Laguna Beach<br />*Last Comic Standing<br />*The Law Firm<br />*My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance<br />*The Mole<br />*Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica<br />*The Osbournes<br />*The Real Gilligans Island<br />*The Rebel Billionaire<br />*The Restaurant<br />*Rock Star: INXS<br />*The Scholar<br />*The Simple Life<br />*So You Think You Can Dance<br />*Survivor<br />*The Swan<br />*Tommy Lee Goes To College<br />*Who Wants To Marry My Dad?<br />*Who Wants To Marry a Millionaire?<br /><br />...and the list goes on. Add in the fact that some of these shows unfortunately go one for multiple seasons and it makes it that much more unbearable.  Anyway, you have all these shows that are <em>hardly</em> original in the first place, and then you have a select few who take it even one step further to what has to be plagiarism. For example, in January 2005, ABC came out with the show "SuperNanny" which itself was based on a British TV show, and shortly after that was released, you had FOX come out with their show, "Nanny 911" which has the EXACT same premise. In another instance, ABC premiered their show "Extreme Makeover: Home Edition" and now FOX has "created" the program "Renovate My Family".... guess what? The plot is virtually the same. And last year, the original "Extreme Makeover" was quickly responded to by FOX with "The Swan" which was essentially Extreme Makeover in a contest setting. And if you notice, there happens to be a common thread through all of those examples just listed. The FOX Network. They are by far the least creative and biggest culprit in all of this. They make a mockery of even their own product.  As you probably know, "The OC" became a huge success, so they then put out "North Shore" which has the huge distinction of taking place on a different beach. That same network is also home to "American Idol" which they now copy with "So You Think You Can Dance", which is literally American Idol with dancing.<br /><br />Other aspects of some reality shows are being photocopied from one to another so that its now at the point where it is increasingly less comical and more and more depressing.  Part of the reason "American Idol" was such a hit was because mean old Simon Cowell insulted the contestants and was an angry snob.  A few months ago FOX (yes, them again) aired "Hell's Kitchen" whose whole schtick was a mean old <em>chef</em> who insults the contestants and is an angry snob. Coincidence?<br /><br />Of course, all of this does not just stop at the boundaries of the TV screen. The movie studios are just as guilty. Most of what they come up with now seems to be not new, amazing, groundbreaking films, but either sequels or remakes.  They milk every dollar they can out of a franchise and do not care where that leaves the quality. They've remade Willy Wonka for petes sake. WILLY WONKA! One of the best movies ever made! A lot of, if not most of this summers films are remakes of something too. Just think and count all the remakes they've come out with recently. Bad News Bears, Charlie and The Chocolate Factory, Dukes Of Hazzard, The Longest Yard, Bewitched, War Of the Worlds, The Amityville Horror, Ocean's 11, Texas Chainsaw Massacre... etc. And Disney has no shame at all.  If a film is a hit for them, they now pump out sequels and prequels like nothing.  And most of them are not even released in theaters.  They had a Cinderella 2, like 6 Lion Kings, multiple Little Mermaid sequels...  They're tarnishing what ever legacy those films might have had.  Nothing is sacred to these people!<br /><br />And some of you might say "Well, it was always like that to some degree". And yeah, I'm sure it was. But not to the extent it is right now. 70s and 80s sitcoms did leech of each other, thats obvious. But I think we can all agree this is ridiculous.<br /><br />Very few people in Hollywood, in particular the people behind the desks, have any self respect or respect of what they do at all. They suck every last dollar out of a successful franchise because in the end, that is what they care about, the money, not the product. Thank god those people don't sell us anything else, like something we would depend on. I'm ashamed to be in a society where we pay people who pump out this... crap millions and millions of dollars and yet we pay our teachers and nurses close to nothing.  The entertainment <strong>industry</strong> is a parody of itself. And it really gives me a headache.<br /><br />COMING SOON: "Gone With The Wind 2" starring Hillary Duff and Ludacris.
