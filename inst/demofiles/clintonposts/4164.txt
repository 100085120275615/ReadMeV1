<blockquote>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) is holding up renewal of the Ryan White Act, the law which funds most HIV/AIDS campaigns across the country, and some health care workers in the field suggest that her expected presidential bid may have something to do with it.

<p>Clinton has said she is opposed to the renewal bill because it would reduce grants in New York State, but the Washington Post reports the measure would also cut federal spending in California, Florida and Illinois, states she would need to win if she seeks the presidency. </p>

<p>"If you look at the states she has to carry to become president -- California, New York, Illinois, Florida - those would be the hardest hit if the formula were changed," Charles Grant, founder of AbsoluteCare Medical Center Inc., the largest private HIV/AIDS medical center in Georgia told the Post.</p>

<p>Under the renewal money lost by the four states would be funneled to areas such as the South where AIDS particularly among African American men has seen a dramatic increase.</p>

<p>"I must share with you the bewilderment of African Americans throughout the country who cannot understand why you are taking this stand against opening the door to more equitable funding that will chiefly benefit people of color," said Harry C. Alford, chief executive of the National Black Chamber of Commerce, in a letter to Clinton obtained by the Post. "It is with sadness that I learn about your efforts to block" the law's reauthorization.</p>

<p>In a reply Clinton acknowledged the rapid increase in HIV cases among Black men but noted that the way the White renewal is written it "would have a devastating impact on New York".</p>

<p>Her position has gained support from AIDS in the four large states adversely affected.</p>

<p>New York's Gay Men's Health Crisis says it "fully supports Senator Clinton's position on the current bill," and the San Francisco AIDS Foundation says the current bill "is a problem."</p>

<p>Currently the White Act funding is based on the number of patients with AIDS while the new funding formula would, in effect, distribute funding based on the number of patients with HIV or AIDS.</blockquote></p>

<p>Those health care workers are most likely correct. Of course the odds are it won't be proven. Hillary has a good alibi here in that she is concerned about it's effect on the state of New York which she represents. It's pretty good cover, but I'd bet she is also thinking about the effects on those other 4 states which would be key in 2008. We will see in the coming days if anyone investigates just how detrimental this would be to New York. If it turned out it wasn't that bad, then we'd know for sure.</p>
