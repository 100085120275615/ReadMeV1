<div>Imagine:<br />
<br />Hillary Rodham C. elected President of the United States.  I suddenly get a flashback of "Commander in Chief".  First thing that comes to mind is Bill Clinton being the first First Gentleman.<br />
<br />Just picture it! A former president now the First Gentleman. I can only begin to imagine the stuff he'd have to put up with.<br />
<br />I can hear Jay Leno: "Did ya hear the new one about Bill Clinton? He was vaccuuming the Oval Office the other day and found a cigar butt on the floor under Hillary's desk.  I wonder if he even asked her about it!!!!"<br />
<br />Let's hear what my faithful readers (all 6 of you) have to say.</div>
