<div><p>Time is flying here in Ptown, the town that theme weekends built.&nbsp; Bear Week just ended.&nbsp; It was hell on the drains, but lots of the bears came to my shows and after gave me bear hugs, literally. </p>

<p>I left the island for the Opening Ceremonies of the Gay Games in Chicago.&nbsp; Chi-town welcomed us&nbsp; warmly.&nbsp; Like 106 degrees.&nbsp; Which I might have thought was gay-bashing if it weren't for the kick-ass welcome from their very gay friendly mayor, Mayor Daley.&nbsp; My favorite moment was when, after thanking gay people for revitalizing American cities, especially Chicago, he called the thrice-divorced congressional opponents to gay marriage what they are - hypocrites.&nbsp; 30,000 people went wild. </p>

<p>The opening night was quite the spectacle - nothing like watching 12,000 athletes from 30 countries pour out onto Soldiers Field.&nbsp; When they shut the stadium lights down and the field became a rainbow flag of 12,000 glo-sticks, it was pretty impressive.&nbsp; I believe we do have the crowd moving skills to get us the heck out of Iraq.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Backstage I got to see Holly Near, Teresa Trull, Barbara Higbie, Nedra Johnson, Suzanne Westenhoffer, Jim Hormel, Margaret Cho and so many of my pals.&nbsp; It was a hopping green room.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The show at The Park West, one of my all time favorite venues, was sponsored by the fine folks at HRC, which I thought was Hillary Rodham Clinton, but no, it was the Human Rights Campaign.&nbsp; I've got to read my contracts more carefully.&nbsp; The HRC staff was way fun and professional and the place was packed.&nbsp; Some of the gals who were at my first Chicago show at The Mountain Moving Coffeehouse were there!</p>

<p>I made a quick trip with my galpal to see Melissa Etheridge on her summer tour stop in Minneapolis.&nbsp; Yes, I now officially have more frequent flier miles than the Widow Ratzinger, but how hard is that?&nbsp; Melissa was in fine form and voice and there is a transcendent joy of living about her that kicks her performance to new levels.&nbsp; She of course, rocked for two and a half hours.&nbsp; I saw her for a moment with Tammy and the twins to be - in the Twin Cities of course.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I wish the Midwest could export some of its peace to the Mideast.&nbsp; It's heartbreaking - I can feel it even in my sweet summer audiences.&nbsp; Rest up this summer, we've got work to do in the upcoming midterm elections.&nbsp; </p>
