So I'm in Toronto.  Been here for two days.<br /><br />It's been fun catching up with family and friends.<br /><br />Took my first ever flight on <a href="http://www.westjet.com/">WestJet</a>. Vancouver to Toronto for 99$. Wow! Leather seats too. When I arrived at Pearson Airport Mom, Dad and Zack were there to pick me up. When we got back to the city, Zack and I went over to visit with Eric and JJ. Eric was over in Northern Italy for something like 2 years working in restaurant kitchens and learning how to really cook. Today, he's working at a recently opened restaurant, <a href="http://www.georgeonqueen.com/flash.html">George</a> (please see also <a href="http://http//www.missionhillwinery.com/tastingnotes/vinedining.asp"><span>Vine Dining</span></a>, <a href="http://www.toronto.com/feature/13160/?context=restaurants&cslink=cs_generic_2_6">Toronto.Com</a>), part of <a href="http://www.verity.ca/flash.php">Verity</a> an exclusive women only health club. Hope to check it out when Eric is working. Apparently they have an open kitchen. JJ's been in and out of Toronto and the rest of the world. She went to China for an exchange, and spent time travel Europe with Eric and on her own. She's been working with Rosie's dad as a painter and drywaller. Really good to see both of them.<br /><br />Yesterday I spent time with Mom during the day. Had an early dinner and caught a movie with Zack. We saw an advanced screening of the new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000142/">Clint Eastwood</a> film, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405159/">Million Dollar Baby</a>. He directs, produces and stars in the film alongside <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000151/">Morgan Freeman</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005476/">Hillary Swank</a>. It's a boxing movie, but it's the viewer that keeps taking hit after hit in this dark and grotty, yet oddly beautiful picture. It's a fine piece of cinema.<br /><br />On the way home, we stopped at Chapter's and Zack bought me <a href="http://www.speakers.ca/newman_peter.aspx">Peter C. Newman</a>'s latest book, <a href="http://www.mcclelland.com/catalog/display.pperl?0771067925"><span>Here Be Dragons</span></a>. I've been reading and listening to interview, reading excerpts and generally anticipating this book. I can't wait to read it. All the same, I'll be reading the new <a href="http://www.houghtonmifflinbooks.com/authors/roth/">Philip Roth</a> book first so that I can return it to my dad.<br /><br />I spent the latter half of the evening chilling with my boyz, JR and Avi. We hung out at my place for a bit and then found joy at <a href="http://www.timhortons.com/">Tim Horton's</a> -- TimBit's and Hot Chocolate.<br /><br />Today I had lunch with Mom, Zack and Bubbi at <a href="http://www.boba.ca/">Boba</a>. Bubbi had steak and frites, medium rar -- my stand-by -- and gave me a bite. It was delicious as ever. Mom and Zack had Seared Ahi Tuna, our family's favourite -- always top-quality, always so tender. I had a seafood pasta dish called Fregola Sarda, not unlike orzo. The stock was full flavoured, but spicy too. It was beautiful to look at, beautiful to smell, it felt great in my mouth, and most of all it was so damn amazing to enjoy. Even though I ordered the seafood we still saw fit to share a half-litre of the 2001 SHIRAZ New South Wales Yatala Creek. For desert, we all shared a sampler platter. Features included chocolate creme brulee, some kind of wonderful fruit sorbet, watermelon and probably another couple items that I'm not remembering. Basically when you order the desert sampler they give you an itty bitty piece of as many things as they have around to spare. I love <a href="http://www.boba.ca/">Boba</a>. It's an attractive restaurant and the food and service there are always excellent.<br /><br />I saw Rachel Singer in the afternoon. I haven't seen her in close to six months and even though we've talked on the phone, we had a lot of catching up to do, which we managed to do in a brief span of time.<br /><br />I spent the early evening chowing down on leftover's from dinner last night. I made Maui Ribs and rice for Zack last night. Mom and dad came back and I watched tv with them for a little bit before <a href="http://ordinarywords.com/">Danish</a> and his buddy Dave picked me up. We went to Dave Perlman's and watched the new <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000279/">Hank Azaria</a> show <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/tv/shows/huff/tvindex.html">Huff</a>. Zack was telling me about it the other day. He watches it regularly with mom. I can see why. I found the show rivetting.<br /><br />It was good to hang out with the guys. Dave moved into this new condo downtown just a couple of blocks from the water. The condo is small and oddly shaped. It has two different angles of windows so there is a lot of exposure. Dave's apartment is on the 27th floor -- the view is incredible. All of the gear in the kitchen is all brand new.<br /><a href="http://www.westjet.com/"></a>
