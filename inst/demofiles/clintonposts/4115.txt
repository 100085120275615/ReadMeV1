<p> <span>In case you haven't heard, one of the co-authors of the anti-Kerry book/smear job <i>Unfit for Command</i> posts frequently to that bastion of sunshie, freerepublic.com (<a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200408060010">media matters has the skinny</a>):</span></p> <p><span><blockquote><span><span>Corsi on "John F*ing Commie Kerry"</span>: "After he married TerRAHsa, didn't John Kerry begin practicing Judiasm? He also has paternal grandparents that were Jewish. What religion is John Kerry?"</span><br /><br /><span>Corsi on Senator "FAT HOG" Clinton</span>: "Anybody ask why HELLary couldn't keep BJ Bill satisfied? Not lesbo or anything, is she?"</blockquote></span></p> <p><span>And the AP has picked it up at long last (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/app/%27http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=">here</a>).  These two paragraphs sum it up.<br /><br /></span></p> <p><span><blockquote>"President Bush (<a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://news.search.yahoo.com/search/news?fr=news-storylinks&amp;p=%22President%20Bush%22&amp;c=&n=20&amp;yn=c&c=news&amp;cs=nw">news</a> - <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/DailyNews/manual/*http://search.yahoo.com/search?fr=web-storylinks&amp;p=President%20Bush">web sites</a>) should immediately condemn this sleazy book written by a virulent anti-Catholic bigot. It says something about the smear campaign against John Kerry that it has stooped to enlist a hatemonger," said [Kerry] campaign spokesman Chad Clanton. </blockquote></span></p> <p> <span>   </span></p> <p> <span> Calls to the Bush-Cheney campaign were not immediately returned."</span><span><br /></span></p> <p><span>Every campaign features some less-than-desirables (for the candidates, at least) from both sides. These people should be condemned by both campaigns (and we're halfway there now!), and the media shouldn't take anyone with this sort of axe to grind seriously. But this is the real world, so I guess I just have to keep dreaming<br /></span></p>
