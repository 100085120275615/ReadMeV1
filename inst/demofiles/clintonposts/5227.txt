Anyone remember the fuss over Prussian Blue, the <a href="http://www.clareified.com/2005/11/09/so-rich-so-white/">cute little twin pop singers who really weren't that cute because they sang about white supremacism</a>?<br /><br />Interesting thing - they apparently live with their mom, which seems to be where they picked up their special little take on the world around them.  Well, their dad wasn't in the picture, and he professes himself shocked and appalled at having his kids turned into the Aryan Nation version of Hillary and Haylie Duff.  <br /><br />So, he does what any outraged non-custodial parent would do in that situation - he <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2340169&page=1">goes to court to try and get custody of his kids</a>. <br /><br />Get this - <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=2340169&page=2">he loses</a>.  <blockquote>And that's why Lingelser went back to court to try to regain custody, which he lost when he and April first divorced because, he admits, he had a problem with drugs.<br /><br />"I had a drug issue, and you know, I was not always the most responsible parent," Lingelser says.<br /><br />ABC News uncovered a troubling letter in which Lingelser threatened to kill April and the twins if she told police of his drug abuse.<br /><br />Lingelser says he's no longer a threat to his girls. He lives and works in San Diego, and says he's now clean and sober and believes he would be a better parent.<br /><br />But a judge in California ruled in April's favor. She retains sole custody of Lynx and Lamb.</blockquote>  How messed up does a person have to be for a judge to think his kids are better off with the woman who's turning them into Nazis?
