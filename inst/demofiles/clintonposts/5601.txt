The <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/columnists/view.bg?articleid=151737&format=text">Boston Herald</a> has a story on soft support for Sen. Hillary Clinton.<br /><br /><blockquote><em>Dick Bennett has been polling New Hampshire voters for 30 years. And heâs never seen anything like it.</em> <p></p><p><em>Bennett runs American Research Group Inc., a highly regarded, independent polling company based in Manchester, N.H. Heâs been conducting voter surveys there since 1976. The polls are financed by subscribers and corporate sponsors.<br /></em></p></blockquote><br />And Hillary isn't going to like what he has seen.<br /><br /><blockquote><em>âLying b**** . . . shrew . . . Machiavellian . . . evil, power-mad witch . . . the ultimate self-serving politician.â</em> </blockquote>Sounds like these are some pretty perceptive Red State people.<br /><br />But they're not Red Staters.<br /><br /><blockquote><em>These were ordinary, grass-roots Democrats. People who identified themselves as "likelyâ voters in the pivotal stateâs Democratic primary. And, behind closed doors, this is what nearly half of them are saying.</em> </blockquote>I was surprised to read this myself. I don't think I have ever heard mention of animus such as this amoung Democratic voters. Nearly half??<br /><br />This has got to worry the Hillary handlers, if they're even listening.<br /><br /><blockquote><em>âI was amazed,â says Bennett. âI thought there might be some negatives, but I didnât know it would be as strong as this. Itâs stunning, the similarities between the Republicans and the Democrats, the comments they have about her.â</em> </blockquote><p>There is a common element, a single thread running behind this; it appears to be a visceral distrust of the woman. A well deserved distrust.</p><p></p><em><blockquote><em>Hillaryâs growing brain trust in the partyâs upper reaches already knows she has high ânegativesâ among ordinary Democrats. They think she can win those voters over with the right strategy and message.</em> </blockquote></em><p>They're whistling past the cemetary. It is not a matter of strategy. If anything, her message since 1992 has been entirely consistent, she and her husband are opportunists who cannot be trusted. </p><em><blockquote><p><em>Because weâre not talking about âsoftâ negatives like, say, âout of touchâ or âarrogant.â </em></p><p><em>Weâre talking: âCriminal . . . megalomaniac . . . fraud . . . dangerous . . . devil incarnate . . . satanic . . . power freak.â </em></em></p></blockquote><p>Maybe the whitewash that the MSM has been slathering all over the Clintons needs a fresh coat. Or maybe whitewash just isn't going to do the job any longer. </p><em><blockquote><em>Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginiaâs Center for Politics, agrees. âThere is far more anti-Hillary sentiment in the Democratic Party than the pollsters understand,â he says.</em> </blockquote></em><p>Fasten your seatbelts, the next Presidential election cycle might get a little bumpy while the Democrats are switching drivers.<br /></p>
