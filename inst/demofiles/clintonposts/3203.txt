<div>I spent some time over the weekend considering endorsements, especially in light of Freddy Ferrer's success in the democratic primary. What do his myriad endorsements mean to democratic voters across the city, and do these political endorsements arise from the efficacy of the candidate?<br />
<br />Endorsements are a staple of any industry: Hollywood uses them to sell movies, i.e. if you liked this older movie, you will like this new one; music labels promote newer bands by putting them on tour with established ones; athletes promote products because they have been paid to do so. These are all examples of endorsements which benefit the endorser and the endorsee, and there could be some argument over who is in fact endorsing who in some cases.<br />
<br />But who exactly pays attention to these endorsements? Members of sub-communities rally around those whom they have endorsed for the benefit of themselves and to make it known to external communities what exactly they want through an endorsement, or who the best person will be to get what it is that they want. This takes place in political clubs, non-profit organizations and from other, possibly more viable, politicians or public figures.<br />
<br />In the case of Ferrer, the democratic community has come to rally around him to let its members and external communities know who they believe will be the best candidate for mayor. But why? Why rally around a candidate when there are so many reasons not to?<br />
<br />It is known that City Comptroller Bill Thompson would like to run for mayor in 2009, as most likely will Anthony Weiner. Chuck Schumer's wife is a commissioner under the current mayor, and there is debate over whether that could change under a Ferrer administration (probably not). Hillary Clinton, David Dinkins and a number of other democrats have expressed no desire to criticize Bloomberg or his policies, and have in fact refused to do so. Others, like Eliot Spitzer, have expressed dismay with some of Ferrer's proposed policies, like the stock-transfer tax.<br />
<br />So why have all of these prominent democrats come to rally around Ferrer? It is not for the sake of Ferrer becoming mayor or his policies taking effect, but for their own efficacy in office or in public life. So why should the Democrats of New York heed this call to rally around our nominee? When this question is answered in full, I will consider voting for Fernando Ferrer.<br />
<br />Although Bloomberg has promoted a number of heinous atrocities against freedom of speech, human rights, and has lent his support to a president who is running our country into the ground, he will win. This is true for the very reason that the media and even our own democratic public figures cannot give us a straight answer on why he should not be mayor for four more years; whether it be because Ferrer would truly be a better mayor and why, or that anything he has done in four years has been excruciatingly wrong.<br />
<br />I will end in a disclaimer. Although I have never considered not voting when given the opportunity to do so and take my voting rights very seriously, I do not consider either of the mayoral candidates worthy of my support. I will go into the voting booth on November 8, but unless circumstances change dramatically, I will be skipping over the section for mayor.</div>
