<br />A bust, yes, bust, of Hillary Clinton, bearing ample cleavage, was <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/11/ap/politics/mainD8JEEFA80.shtml">unveiled this week</a> at the <a href="http://www.puzzlehouse.com/images/webpage/thezoo.jpg">Museum of Sex</a> in <a href="http://www.washington.edu/newsroom/news/images/desert.jpg">Manhattan</a>.  Artist Daniel Edwards said that <br />
<br />"Her cleavage is on display, prominently portraying sexual power which some people still consider too threatening." <br />
<br />Edwards is the same sculptor responsible for the piece depicting <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/249/373/1600/barbie.0.jpg">Britney Spears on her knees giving birth</a> on a bearskin rug.<br />
<br />Clinton has not commented on the bust, but I am reliably informed that she spent yesterday morning at <a href="http://www.midhudsonnews.com/News/Clinton_Pok-15Aug06.htm">CIA HQ</a>, asking everyone what they thought of her baps.</div>
