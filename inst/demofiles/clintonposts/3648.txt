<div>There. I've said it. You support the vast amounts of money the Saudis are charging us for oil, so they can give more money to their crazy cousins who are starting Jihads against us all over the middle east. Then we have to have MORE oil for the war so we can fight the very well funded terrorists.<br />Figure it out. There were no Iraqi's involved in 911.<br />I love seeing people under 30 voting Republican. Nothing cracks me up more. Here are these assholes, who (unless helped out by their daddies) will be hard pressed to make more than 40 grand and rise above middle management. Twenty percent of that money is going for insurance and MAYBE 401K.  They are blind to the fact that they are merely the bottom tier of a well organized pyramid scam that funnels money UP, with very little "trickle down". Occasionally they find themselves reading pap such as "Who moved my cheese" and getting all fired up that they are "going places". If only they could get the right attitude about things and put their nose to the grind. Your going no where man. You will be divorced and middle aged and blaming your lot on your bitch ex-wife and the blood sucking welfare mothers and minorities. You think that if these people hadn't held you back..you would know for a flipping fact WHO MOVED YOUR CHEESE and you would BE SOMEBODY. Meanwhile you will keep voting Republican and supporting your jobs getting shipped overseas and driving down wages. You will say "Hell yeah" to tax cuts for oil companies. For the same companies that posted record profits so you can pay MORE taxes to make up the slack. Thus keeping you in a shit pegged hole for the rest of your life.<br />Go Team.<br />It boggles the mind the crap people can be convinced to believe. Like the Republican marketing machine urging you to sell your soul, your first born and any morals you were in possession of for the sake of being "American". And by that they really mean helping them to achieve the American dream of doing as little work possible for as much money imaginable and paying plum nothing in taxes for it whatsoever. If lunatics like Joseph Smith and L. Ron What's-his could start a religion it's only a matter of time before they start referring to the "Prophet Karl Rove."<br />I think Bush should get off of his coward, war dodging, fat ass that has been planted in Crawford Tx for 20% of his hellish presidency (lower case p on purpose) and meet with the mothers of the boys he has killed to make his buddies some cash.<br />I think Karl should go to prison for the rest of his life for treason.<br />I think Cheney should just go ahead and give in to one of his three thousand heart attacks.<br />But most of all I think we should start chanting over and over and over<br />Hillary Clinton '08!!!!!!!!! (If for no other reason than to watch them sputter and spit and piss themselves with thought of a pair of ovaries standing behind that presidential seal)</div>
