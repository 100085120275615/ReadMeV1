<div><p>I really shouldn't be posting...I have a wildly messy art table to clean up and I'm dead tired after a long day- scrapping, then bowling with friends (and a very exciteable toddler!), then cooking dinner, then more scrapping. But I had to pause and say something that I was thinking about the other day, before I forget to get the thoughts down.</p>

<p>On Friday, Sean and I went to the park as usual and then stopped by the post office to drop off a few packages. As we were leaving- Sean talking a mile a minute as always, and me laughing at what he was saying- it struck me how happy I was. I'm a pretty happy person ALL the time, so maybe the word I'm looking for is &quot;content&quot;? I don't know...since Sean was a teeny baby, it's always been a struggle for me to balance out my life. Hard to be both ME and a Mom. Hard to feel like I can meet all of his needs without neglecting my own, and vice versa. I worried I would never achieve this happy medium. But on Friday, I finally realized that I have. I am confident in my parenting. I am happy with what I am passing on to Sean...the memories that we are making, the traditions we are sharing, the little routines we live by, the conversations we have. I am proud of the little boy he is, and I'm proud of the mom I am becoming. I <em>love</em> being Sean's mommy. Life is good. Really good. </p>

<p>And here are the day's efforts. The first is a page with some old photos, from back when I was still pregnant with Sean. A simple page about dinner out with one of my best friends and her husband (journaling is on the back). </p>

<p>This next one is a tribute to my OB/GYN...gosh, it didn't sound odd until I &quot;said&quot; that out loud! I'm trying to scrap the most important stories/people in my life, and Dr. P. certainly fit the bill, so I scrapped him! :) (This one is inspired by a layout by <a href="http://soundsofscience.blogspot.com/">Kristina Contes</a>, called &quot;We are real&quot;.)</p>

<p>And this last one was a total rush job. My friend Hillary and I challenged each other to do a page in an hour and this is what I came up with. A bit wild and messy, and totally Heidi Swapp inspired! </p>

<p>(<em>Note- if you're curious about the S&amp;M thing, here's the sordid story: My local scrapbook store at the time was called Scrapbooks &amp; Memories, so for each Friday, my calendar said &quot;S&amp;M, 6pm-midnight&quot;. Some of my friends saw that and thought it was hilarious- once they understood what I was REALLY doing on Friday nights!- and always teased me about it. So I had to include that reference. Ironically, that LSS closed, and my new one was named A Scrapbook Store...so, you guessed it, instead of &quot;S&amp;M&quot; on Friday nights, I switched to &quot;ASS&quot; on Saturday nights! Gotta love it....)&nbsp;  :) </em></p></div>
