<br />and sail to Lahaina
<br />just like the missionaries did, so many years ago
<br />They even brought a neon sign: &quot;Jesus is coming&quot;
<br />Brought the white man's burden down
<br />Brought the white man's reign&quot; ~ The Eagles, <em><strong>The Last Resort</strong></em></p>

<p>On our last day in Maui we came across this sign on Front Street in Lahaina. I started yelling &quot;Pull Over! Pull Over!&quot; and thank god I didn't scare Dan too much. As he pulled over to indulge his photo crazy wife, I noticed that we were in fact, not the only ones who had pulled over to take a photo of this sign. Mission accomplished. </p>

<p>We decided on this trip that we like Maui...a LOT. We also decided that we don't like Honolulu very much. We visited Kailua for the first time. Ate lunch as <a href="http://www.frommers.com/destinations/oahu/D37847.html">Buzz's</a> by the beach. When I get my non-digital photos developed, I'll share more photos including the photo my son took of the spot where Bill and Hillary at at Buzz's!</p>

I am embarassed to say that my 15 year old son spoted the humor in this sign well before I did. He made us stop so he could take a photo of it with his phone and he promptly sent it to all of his friends. We had a pretty good laugh at it and my 13 year old asked the $64,000 question, &quot;Who would name their kid Mary Jane if their last name was Stoner?&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed. Of course I realize that there are other ways that she could have ended up with that name...but then where is the fun in that?</p>

<p>Our travels are done for now. I realize that I did hardly any blogging about BlogHer and I'm regretting it. I think I was so pre-occupied with the trip coming up that I wasn't as engaged in BlogHer as I would like to have been. I've been having a blast reading posts by <a href="http://badgerbag.typepad.com/badgerbag/">Badgerbag</a>, <a href="http://gracedavis.typepad.com/i_am_dr_lauras_worst_nigh/">Grace</a>, <a href="http://www.socalmom.net/travelblog/">SocalMom</a>, <a href="http://www.christine.net/">Christine,</a> <a href="http://leftcoastmom.blogspot.com/">Left Coast Mom</a> and others. I really missed participating in day 2. Too many things to do, too little time.</p>
