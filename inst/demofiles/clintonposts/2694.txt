<div><p>Childrenâs
marketing in general and interactive commercials were both on the hot seat
yesterday at a conference sponsored by Children Now, a childrenâs advocacy
group based in California</p>



<p> <a href="http://clinton.senate.gov/">Senator
Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY)</a> and FCC Commissioners <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/copps/">Michael Copps</a> and <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/commissioners/adelstein/">Jonathan
Adelstein</a> were very critical of the impact of advertising on our children. Senator Clinton argued that marketers are
conducting a âmassive experimentâ on our nationâs children. Commisioner Copps argued that children have
become âcommoditiesâ to be sold to marketers. Commissioner Adelstein repeated a comment made to other audiences that
ânothing good comes from marinating our childrenâs brains in advertising and
violent programming.â </p>



<p>The three
policymakers were also very critical of any interactivity in commercials during
childrenâs programming. In 2004, the FCC
reached a âtentative conclusionâ that there should not be interactive links
from childrenâs programs to commercial websites unless parents opt in to such
services. The Commission asked for
further comments on how to implement such a policy but has never followed up on
this âtentative conclusion.â Senator
Clinton and the two FCC Commissioners all argued that the FCC should finalize
that policy and ban or seriously restrict any interactivity between commercials
in childrenâs programs and commercial websites. Commissioner Adelstein argued that interactivity must be restricted
because âthe transition to digital television provides new opportunities for
marketers to exploit children.â</p>



<p>The rhetoric
of the three policymakers illustrates the challenging political environment
facing childrenâs marketers. Unfortunately, some of the rhetoric is based on fiction, not fact. For example, Senator Clinton and Commissioner
Adelstein both repeated the âurban legendâ that the average child in America
is exposed to as many as 40,000 television commercials a year.</p>



<p>Thatâs an
incredible number that gets headlines and raises eyebrows, but it is simply not
true. Three FTC analysts compared the
so-called âestimateâ to the total number of hours children spend in front of
their TV sets. They calculated that
children 4 to 6 years old would be watching 94 ads per hour in order to see
40,000 commercials per year. All
children 2 to 18 would be watching 40 commercials per hour to see that many TV
ads per year. See <a href="http://www.law.gmu.edu/faculty/papers/wpDetail.php?wpID=264">Todd Zywicki, Deborah

<p>There are
serious and legitimate policy issues about the role of childrenâs marketing in the
online world and in the digital TV transition. Debate on those issues should be based on fact, not fiction.</p></div>
