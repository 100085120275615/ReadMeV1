It truly amazes me how stupid most people really are, and how easily the mainstream media (MSM) can manipulate opinion to advance their own political agenda.<br /><br />I've talked about this ad nauseam in other postings on this blog, including my February 26th posting, <a href="http://greeknotion.blogspot.com/2006/02/todays-propaganda-machine-reminders-of.html">Today's Propaganda Machines and Reminders of the Past</a>. The weak, uninformed mind is the prey upon which MSM feeds and since most people are really fucking stupid, it is no small wonder that public opinion blames President Bush for the price of gas or thinks that the President has any real control over world economics despite his own rhetoric on the matter.<br /><br />In an appalling manipulation of information by CNN, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/24/bush.poll/">this article</a> tries to draw a correlation between the president's drop in approval ratings and the price of gasoline, even though the poll does not measure that correlation, let alone the fact that polls aren't real news anyway. CNN wants to perpetuate the notion that the president is to blame for the price of oil, even though their information does not validate that as factual, nor were there any direct questions in the poll to that effect. Mere conjecture on the part of the "journalist" who wrote the article presupposes that people are pissed at Bush because they are pissed at the price of gasoline. This article was totally designed to let the reader draw a conclusion the evidence does not support. And never mind the fact that the real news story here is why President Bush's approval ratings are down despite an economic boom that goes largely unreported.<br /><br />The truth is that CNN and the rest of MSM doesn't want you to know the truth. Your minds are being manipulated and your attention is being drawn elsewhere so you won't easily see the <em>real</em> problem unless you're prepared to flex your cerebral muscles, something most people don't want to do because of their intellectual laziness, as I have asserted before in my March 30th posting <a href="http://greeknotion.blogspot.com/2006/03/ill-and-angry.html">Ill and Angry</a>.<br /><br />The large oil producers in this capitalist country are producing a product which we need and for which we are willing to pay; they create jobs and income for those that choose to work for them in a myriad of capacities; they return equity and capital income to their investors; and they keep a supply of gasoline streaming at the pumps so you can drive your fucking SUV, even though you'll never take one off of an Interstate highway, or so you can drive your fucking pick-up truck, even though you're in a white collar job and will never haul anything more substantial than grocery bags and empty Pepsi cans.<br /><br />But in the world view of many, Big Oil are the bad guys and Big Government are the good guys. One of the entities in this equation extracts, refines and distributes a product we all require, creates jobs and family income in the process, and builds wealth for those that take the risk to invest in a volatile industry with their retirement portfolios. All the while, the other entity in this equation takes half of what you earn in one form of taxation or another while you watch CNN and listen to the liberal congressional elite bitch about Big Oil's "record profits."<br /><br />For the record, Shell employs about 112,000 people; British Petroleum (which also owns Amoco) employs 96,000; Exxon-Mobil employs 84,000; Chevron (which also owns Texaco) employs about 60,000; Conoco-Phillips employs 38,000 and Marathon Oil employs 26,000; and these numbers do not include the vast numbers of independent contractors, geologists, drillers, distributors, and franchised outlet operators and their employees. Big Government takes a huge chunk from each and every one of them in the form of withholding and FICA taxes, and that's <em>after</em> taxing the gasoline they produce as well. And no one seems to bitch about that.<br /><br />MSM has treated "record profits" like this is somehow an evil thing. Excuse me, but I thought we were a capitalist country where it is <em>precisely</em> the profit motive than makes this country what it is; indeed, capitalism is the economic engine <em>behind</em> our representative democracy, such as it is. Plus, we're in an economic boom, for Christ's sake. What the fuck do you expect? And so what, anyway? Lots of industries are reporting record profits. The lodging industry just reported 2005 as the highest profit year <em>ever</em>, but you don't see people all up in arms about the room rates at their local Holiday Inn, so you? Nissan just reported a record year. Where is the outrage over that? The financial markets are all reporting record earnings this past quarter including Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Merrill Lynch. I don't see a lot of protesting or negative press about that.<br /><br />It is absurd to express any outrage at "record profits" of any publicly traded company, unless you're a fucking socialist. Instead of bitching about their record profits, you need to invest some of your crack money, or your beer money, or your cigarette money, or your whore money, and cash in on the bonanza. But very few small minded, ignorant people think like that. They just watch CNN, throw their fists up in the air and scream about how Big Oil is fucking them over.<br /><br />Oil companies' "record profits" and all the saber clanging by the liberal Congressional elite (most of whom are millionaires, by the way); all of this rhetoric of completely unfounded and indeed disproved price gouging; all the press releases and TV sound bytes demanding to see oil companies' financial records; all of the threats to legislatively impose a windfall profit tax; these are all bullshit ploys, with MSM as its envoy, designed to distract your attention from the real problem: namely that <em>they, the Congressional branch of our government and its liberal membership,</em> is the real problem. Their tax and spend mentality, their big government mentality, their environment over people mentality, their 60-second sound byte mentality, their thirst for power and their personal hubris have all served to create the current pricing structure, not the fucking President.<br /><br />Okay, you got that? <em>The fucking Congress is the reason gasoline prices are so high, not the President.<br /></em><br />So let me point out a few facts that seem to continually escape attention of MSM and the vast majority of weak-minded, unacquainted, unapprised, ignorant, badly informed, unaware, thick, dense, slow, dull, brainless or oblivious Americans who believe all this shit that "Big Oil" are the bad guys, their "record profits" are evil, and the President is to blame.<br /><br />But two more thoughts before I do:<br /><br /><ul><li>First of all, how would you like it if "Big Oil" were to just stop producing gasoline and you couldn't drive around in your fucking SUVs and your fucking pick-up trucks anymore? You know, nobody makes these guys do what they do. They do it for the fucking money. They do it for the fucking money because we're a capitalist society and that's the way it works. Everything we do is for the fucking money. It's only the ass-sitters, the slackers and the ne'er-do-wells who want others to do it for them that whine about the way it is. </li><li>Secondly, if not capitalism that produces gasoline so you can drive around in your fucking SUVs and your fucking pick-up trucks, then it becomes a governmental concern, and we all know about how well the fucking government can run things. Can you imagine oil drilling, refinery production and gasoline distribution if it were run by the fucking government? Know what you'd get? Fucking Mexico is what you'd get. Fucking Mexico nationalized their oil exploration and gasoline production under the brand name P-Mex. You wanna be like Mexico? Well, scratch that question. Yes, some of you do want to be like Mexico.</li></ul><p>Okay, pay attention, class: </p><ul><li>Fifty-five percent of the revenue that oil companies take in is spent on the price of crude oil. Crude oil is sold at auction and it's prices are driven first by the capital costs and operational expenses of exploration, drilling and extracting; and second by supply and demand.</li><li>Demand for crude oil in the U.S. in 2005 increased exactly zero over the prior year, while global demand for oil in the world increased 1.1 million barrels a day. In 2006, total demand is expected to increase by 1.6 million barrels a day, with only about 15% of this increase coming from the U.S. It is therefore global demand, not so much demand here in the U.S. that is causing supplies to decrease at a more accelerated rate. What happens, class, when demand goes up and supply goes down? Anyone? Right! The fucking price goes up. You got that? <em>When demand goes up and supply goes down, prices go up. </em>That is the most basic economic law of supply and demand and the President doesn't have one goddamn iota of influence over this primal economic force.</li><li>Estimates of spare oil production (i.e., the rate at which supply outpaces demand) was over 5.5 million barrels a day in 2001, which was the highest since 1991. In 2005, it was at its lowest since 1991, at about 1.25 million barrels a day.</li><li>In May 2001, the average price of crude oil was 65 cents per gallon. In May 2006 it is $1.76 per gallon; that is an increase of 97%. The price of gasoline in May 2001 averaged $1.61. In May 2006, it is averaging $2.92; that is an increase of 81%. So the price of crude has risen at a rate faster than the price of gasoline.</li><li>Eighteen percent of the revenue that oil companies take in is spent on refining, distribution and retailing.</li><li>Nineteen percent of the revenue that oil companies take in goes to state and federal government in taxes.</li><li>Earnings amount to 8.5%. The average for corporate earnings over the last five years is 5.9%, in line and slightly above average for all other industries at 5.6%.</li><li>For those of you who can follow the math, that means that the government is taking over twice as much of your gasoline dollars than the oil company is making in profit. You got that? <em>More than twice as much.</em></li><li>The ten year average for return on investment (that is net income divided by net investment in place) for the oil industry is 8.5%, compared to the Standard and Poor's Industrials average of 13.9%.</li></ul><p>And who "owns" the oil companies? Private pension funds own 15%. IRA's own 14%. Federal and state pension funds own 12%. Fifty-nine percent is owned by mutual funds, firms and individuals (including Ted Kennedy, Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton, by the way). Any windfall profit tax would undermine the return to these investors and who then really pays the bill? You would, for Christ's sake! Can't anyone figure that out? The oil companies and their investors are not going to accept less profit, so any windfall profit tax would merely be passed on to you, the consumer, in the form of still higher prices.</p><p>So, while you're distracted with CNN reports about "Big Oil" and their "record profits," and all the liberal Congressional elite's rhetorical responses, you don't stop and ask the obvious question: <em>Why the fuck is the government taking 57-cents out of my pocket for every gallon of gasoline that I buy and putting it in their pocket? And that's <strong>after</strong> I have paid income tax, FICA tax and other sales, property and excise taxes?</em> The real issue here is <em>taxation</em>, not profits by the oil companies. If these Congressional members are all-so-fired-up worried about the price I have to pay at the pump, why the fuck don't they quit taxing it at a rate twice a much as the oil companies make in profit, rather than suggest a windfall profit tax? </p><p><em>Windfall?</em> What the fuck is windfall about an 8.5% return on investment versus S&P; Industrial average of 13.5%? Oil companies collectively have invested a <em>trillion dollars</em> over the past ten years in technology and infrastructure to bring gasoline to the pumps and now, they must get it back! But, of course, the regular American driving their fucking SUV and their fucking pick-up truck doesn't understand the truth and can't even ask the right questions.</p><p>The <em>truth</em> about the price of a gallon of gas is in two simple mathematical concepts: (1) It is taxed at a rate of over twice that of oil companies' earnings; and (2) Demand for consumption is increasing at a rate greater than supply is replacing it. It is on this latter concept that I go back to my original hypothesis of this posting: that <em>Congress</em>, not the President, is responsible for the high price of gas today.</p><p>Federal policy, forged by years of liberalism and yielding to the fringe environmental left, have created constraints on the exploration and extraction of abundant supplies of oil and natural gas beneath federal lands and in the costal waters of the Pacific, Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico and Alaskan offshore. All told, there is 112 billion barrels in these locations, which would be enough to power 60 million cars some sixty years. Additionally, there are some 656 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, enough to heat sixty million homes for some 160 years. But the oil companies <em>cannot</em> go get these supplies because of the moratorium on drilling in these locations imposed by regulations created by the tree-hugging, vegetarian, alfalfa-eating, LL Bean-clad environmentalists, supported by the liberal Congressional elite.</p><p>And even if we could go drill for these vast supplies of oil, we wouldn't have the capacity to refine it.</p><p>Federal environmental laws for refinery expansion and new construction has reduced the number of refineries in our country from 225 to just 149 in the past twenty years. A new oil refinery has not been built in the United States since 1976. During that time, our gasoline use has increased over 25 percent. The nation's existing refineries have been running at maximum capacity trying to meet record demand and, as a result, not only do we import oil, we actually have to import 10 percent of our daily gasoline from refineries overseas.</p><p>For the wealthiest, most powerful nation in the world this is a ridiculous situation that will only get worse as our insatiable demand for gasoline keeps growing and refinery capacity falls further behind in the coming years. Just a few new refineries would alleviate the problem and help keep our gas prices lower and steadier. But getting an oil refinery built is next to impossible, hence the 30-year construction drought. There will always be environmental activists, and the liberal Congressional members who support them, who will fight any new proposed refinery, regardless of where it might be located and how environmentally safe it is.</p><p>The environmental impact-report process mobilizes the "not in my back yard" elements to oppose any proposed refinery, but it does not mobilize people or groups who are looking at national energy needs. You wind up with a very lopsided discussion where potential problems are thoroughly and overly represented, but the only group pointing out the benefits of the refinery is the "evil" oil company asking to build it - even though every automobile driver would benefit.</p><p>So, next time you read a CNN report or listen to the MSM report on "Big Oil" and "record profits," look carefully at the facts. Until conservative, rational values take the upper hand in making some Congressional decisions on these issues, and the public at large quits allowing themselves to be manipulated by petrol propaganda, the price of gasoline isn't going to get any cheaper, no matter which party has control of the White House.</p>
