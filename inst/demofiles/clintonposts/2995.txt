<div>Dear Peter:<br />
<br />Please tell your new boss that it's <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/29/mg.thy/">equivocating bullshit like this</a> that's pisses off voters like me -- a Democrat looking for some dogdamn <strong>
<em>leadership</em>.<br />

<blockquote>While she did not directly chastise Republicans for Congress' failure to increase the minimum wage, it was clear her criticism was directed at the GOP.</blockquote>Clear to whom? The "Value Voters" Hillary's sucking up to so they'll vote for her in 08? <em>Man</em>, please.<br />
<br />Listen, voters on both sides of the political spectrum see right through Hillary's campaigning schtick; her cringe-inducing pandering for the 'religious' votes is as obvious to everyone as is the high hilarity of GW Bush "the cowboy."<br />
<blockquote>For Clinton, it is a difficult tight rope to walk as she continues to talk openly on faith and religion without speaking directly about the controversial social issues.</blockquote>Peter, trust me on this: Hillary's no Flying Wallenda.<br />
<blockquote>But like Rothenberg, Green believes that Clinton does "have some religious credentials."</blockquote>You see what I mean? Note the word "some" from the above statement. Nobody's fucking buying what she's selling.  No. One.<br />
<br />Shorter:  If Hillary doesn't get real, <em>right the fuck now,</em>  mine is just one vote she won't receive Nov. 08.<br />
<br />All bestest,<br />Capitola</div>
