I received the following as an email forward from a friend, and although I should just forward it on to <a href="http://darwen.us/southcon/" target="_blank">Darrell at Southcon</a>, who would no doubt appreciate it the most, I thought that perhaps a few of you might like it too..<br /><br /><blockquote><p><em>One day, a fourth-grade teacher asked the children what their fathers did for a living. All the typical answers came up -fireman, mechanic, businessman, salesman, doctor, lawyer, and so forth. But little Johnny was being uncharacteristically quiet, so when the teacher prodded him about his father, he replied: "My father's an exotic dancer in a gay cabaret and takes off his clothes in front of other men because they put money in his underwear." The teacher, obviously shaken by this statement, hurriedly sent the other children to work on a different project and then took little Johnny aside to ask him, "Is that really true about your father?"</em></p><p><em>"No," the boy said, "He works for the Democratic National Committee and is helping to secure the Nomination of Hillary Clinton in 2008 - but I was too embarrassed to say that in front of the other kids."<br /></p></em></blockquote>
