<div>I was so worried Bush would miss the cue to talk about tort reform when the flu vaccine shortage was brought up--Kerry's now trying to make it Bush's fault..the transition wasn't very smooth. "This President has turned his back on the 'wellness' of America."  Hmmm not so good after Bush just expressed genuine concern about the need for older people and young people for flu vaccines.
<br />
<br />Now we're talking about whether the Congressional health program is good enough and affordable for all Americans.  Kerry came out ahead on this one.
<br />
<br />Bush 1  Kerry 1 iow, draw
<br />
<br />Kerry is gong to reinstate "pay as you go."  He has immediately changed the subject to itemize Bush's failures--off topic--now back to topic, he's going to roll back the tax cut; shut the loophole that forces Americans to finance the giveaway of their jobs.  He says he shows how he will pay for everything.
<br />
<br />Bush brings up Kerry's record and shows how Kerry hasn't been fiscally responsible for the last 20 years.  "Paygo means 'you pay' and he goes ahead and spends."  Bush says that his plan to reduce deficit ....

<br />
<br />What about lost jobs?
<br />
<br />Bush says he has policies to grow the economy and help pay for people to learn the skills they need to fill the jobs of the 21st century  He is now touting his No Child Left Behind Plan.  Education, he says is how to help the person who has lost a job.
<br />
<br />He wants people to have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma.
<br />
<br />Kerry stars with Uh and is now telling us how Bush shifted his subject from jobs to education--however, Bush's "shift" wa pretty smooth.  Now he's blaming Bush for tuition increasing and everything else.  Kerry says Bush has cut Pell Grants, Perkins, training money, etc.
<br />
<br />Bush
<br />
<br />More about jobs:  Is it fair to blame the Administration for this loss of jobs
<br />Kerry is good on the subject of not subsicizing the loss of their own jobs. He also wants to lower corporate taxes--amazing. Bush didn't help Boeing when Boeing was being hurt by unfair trade.  He wants us to stand up to China?
<br />
<br />Bush says he has incrased Pell Grants; reminds people of the tac breaks he's offerend.
<br />
<br />Bush has the numbers to back up his contnetion that Kerry is liberal--the far left bank of American politics -Ted Kennedy is the more conservative Senator from Massachusetts.
<br />
<br />Bush
<br />
<br />Gays--is it a choice?
<br />
<br />Bush segues into DOMA--which Kerry opposed--his answer reflects his compassionate conservatism.
<br />
<br />Kerry is also gay bashing--bringing up Dick Cheney's daughter "who is a lesbian." Kerry says it's not a choice--the way God made them.
<br />Kerry says we have an "unbelievable" Constitution.  He comes out as a states righter
<br />
<br />Bush
<br />
<br />What about the Church's opposion to Kerry?  "I will not allow someoone to come in and change Roe v. Wade."  Being Catholic is important to me. Like JFK, I'll  be a Cathlic withoutletting it influence my vote./ 
<br />Good

<br />
<br />Who is resp. for rising health care costs.
<br />
<br />Bush's answer--good consumers are not nvolved in decisions.  He believes in health saving accounts. He does a good job of explaining 3rd party payers and how he would reform that with health savings accounts.
<br />
<br />Kerry's strong on this subject and he has more bills than Bush seems to know about, but his record is still thin.
<br />
<br />
<br />Question about Kerry's health care plan--his plan is "not a government plan."  People will not be forced to change plans. Feds take over medicare from the states and the states get individuals at 3 x poverty level.  People can buy into the Fed health care program and people 55 to 64 can buy into medicare.
<br />
<br />Funny retort from Bush re: Kerry's reference to leading news services that say Bush is wrong about Kerry's plans. Bush is saying that government health care is not the answer.
<br />
<br />Kerry says he is not proposing a government program--and that Bush cut VA benefits and health care.
<br />
<br />Bush says not so.

<br />Social security answer Where woill you get the money?
<br />
<br />Bush  --we'll honor committement to seniors, but fo kids we have t think differently--personal savings accounts.
<br />
<br />Kerry does not like privae accounts for retirment. CBO says benfits would have to e cut...
<br />
<br />Bush
<br />
<br />Ok, got tired and just listened a while--now they are arguing defense and Kerry is going to add two divisions to the Army---good idea--ill Bush again ask him why he let Clinton downsize the military?  Here he goes again, asking for a global approach of alliances to fight enemies.  
<br />
<br />Hush is argung that training Iraq to defend themselves.Bush is doing a good job of defending his way of working with allies and refuses to turn our security over to other natons.
<br />
<br />Now Kerry is calling for a 'Truth" standard and asserting that he will never turn our nation's security to others.  
<br />
<br />Bush is bringing up Kerry's vote against the Irqa War I

<br />Bush is relying on his notes to help him with gun question--he wants to prosecute people who commit crimes with guns.
<br />
<br />Kerry wasnts a ban on certain guns--he says he'll never mess with the 2nd Amendment. He is making a strong case for himself as not weak on this issue but only interested in controling crime and terror.  My 14 year old just pointed out that Kerry's ex. about law enforcement walking into A-K 47s sounded like it was when the ban was in effect!
<br />
<br />Kerry sounds good on the subject of AA--but Bush is refuting his assertion that Bush never met with the black congressional caucus.  Bush is touting his efforts to help poor people go to college.  Bush's defense of his policies resulting in more minority businesses and and home ownership.

<br />
<br />Bush is now explaining that he prays a lot. His faith is personal. He prays for his country and family. He says he's midful that this america and people have a right to worship as they see fit and they are equally American.  He says that prayer sustains him.  He recieves calmness. He says he feels that people pray for him and love s that. He stands on principles when h--he thinks God wants everyone to be free.
<br />
<br />14 year old is accusing him of being a bad Catholic.  He says we have a lot more loving to do in America.  Two school systems for haves and have nots.

<br />Question--country came together after 9/11. Will you set a priority on bringing the country together.  Kerry's answer that President brought the country together then but now he is presiding over the most divided country in memory.
<br />
<br />(Well maybe in his memory, but there have been many times when the country was more divided than it is today).
<br />
<br />Bush's answer: He hoped to be a uniter, not a divider to help education, lower taxes.  but DC is a tough town and there are a lot of special issues--and they dig in.  
<br />

<br />
<br />Bush finally has thrown McCain back at Kerry who has mentioned him a number of times. Bush finally says--"john McCain is for me for President."
<br />
<br />Zinger, point for Bush
<br />
<br />OOOOh, Bush is saying he's learned to listen to his wife--to stand up not scowl!
<br />
<br />Kerry too is praising Laura Bush and Bush himself as a good father.  He doesn't talk that much about Teresa Heinz-Kerry.
