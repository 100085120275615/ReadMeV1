<div><p>Once every few weeks I will run through the most note-worthy political news regarding the 2008 race.&nbsp; With the midterms just more than two months away, we have every reason to be almost entirely focused on the fate of the Legislative Branch.&nbsp; But every now and then, I will preview the 2008 Democratic primary race, which is still wide open.</p>

<p>Here is the latest from the campaign trail:</p>

<ul><li>One year ago, Senator <strong>Joe Biden</strong> (D-Delaware) said that he would test the waters to for a possible presidential run.&nbsp; As of this moment, it appears as though he will definitely run.&nbsp; He spent the last couple of weeks in Iowa.&nbsp; This weekend he is in South Carolina, a state where <strong>John Edwards</strong> is favored.&nbsp; In an <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/politics/15363988.htm">AP article</a> that covered Biden's South Carolina trip, the Senator from Delaware was quoted saying that Edwards is a goner if he doesn't win that state.&nbsp; &quot;If John loses South Carolina, he's done,&quot; Biden said.&nbsp; However, Biden was not trash-talking.&nbsp; In fact, he has a great deal of respect for Edwards.&nbsp; Biden said that &quot;John is a real player&quot; and he does &quot;take John real seriously.&quot;&nbsp; According to a different article one week ago, <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/8/16/203420.shtml">Biden said</a> that he and his family had a talk around Christmas of 2004, and they all signed on to the commitment.&nbsp; The last time Joe Biden ran for president was in 1988.</li>

<li><strong>Mark Warner</strong> <a href="http://www.thephoenix.com/article_ektid20946.aspx">spent last weekend in New Hampshire</a> getting an early start on the campaigning.&nbsp; Yesterday that trip paid off as <a href="http://www.dailypress.com/news/opinion/dp-07918sy0aug26,0,1149666.story?coll=dp-opinion-editorials">The Daily Press</a>, a Virginia newspaper, touted his pledge to campaign in New Hampshire if the state decides to defy the DNC and move its primary to an earlier date.</li>

<li>Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, a Republican, is considering the idea of running for president in 2008.&nbsp; But an <a href="http://www.katv.com/news/stories/0806/355707.html">Opinion Research Associates of Little Rock poll</a> finds that Arkansans would favor both <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> and <strong>Wesley Clark</strong> over Huckabee.&nbsp; Clinton got the better of Huckabee by a 49% to 36% margin.&nbsp; Wesley Clark received even better numbers, beating Huckabee 51% to 37%.</li>

<li>Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold is scheduled to <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060815/cgtu042.html?.v=67">address the Chicago Bar on Monday</a>.</li>

<li><a href="http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/login.asp">The Daily Nation</a>, a Kenyan newspaper, is fantasizing about <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> possibly choosing <strong>Barack Obama</strong> as her running mate.</li>

<li>According to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/26/AR2006082600735.html">Sunday's Washington Post</a>, <strong>Evan Bayh</strong> is strengthening ties with New Hampshire Governor John Lynch and Iowa Gubernatorial candidate Chet Culver.&nbsp; &quot;Bayh's fundraising gambit is the latest evidence of his innovative
approach to courting the activists essential to the 2008 nominating
process,&quot; the newspaper wrote for Sunday.</li></ul>
