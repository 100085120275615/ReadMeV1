The bar has a robot bartender.The robot serves him a perfectly prepared cocktail, and then asks him, "What's your IQ?"<br /><br />The man replies "150".<br /><br />The robot proceeds to make conversation about global warming factors, quantum physics & spirituality, biochemistry, environmental erconnectedness, string theory, nanotechnology, & sexual proclivities.<br /><br />The customer is very impressed & thinks, "This is really cool." He decides to test the robot. He walks out of the bar, turns around, & comes back in for another drink.<br /><br />Again, the robot serves him the perfectly prepared drink & asks him, "What's your IQ?"<br /><br />The man responds, "about 100."<br /><br />Immediately the robot starts talking, but this time about football, NASCAR, baseball, supermodels, favorite fast foods, guns, & women's body parts.<br /><br />Really impressed, the man leaves the bar & decides to give the robot 1 more test. He heads out & returns.<br /><br />The robot serves him and asks, "What's your IQ?"<br /><br />The man replies, "Er, 50, I think."<br /><br />The robot says... real slowly, "So... is.. your... party... gonna... nominate...
