<em>
<span>Television debate: Ned Lamont and Joseph Lieberman</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<span>Joe Lieberman, the once invincible Democratic Senator from Connecticut, has been ousted. Yep, seeya Joe. That's what happens (or, at least, what <em>should </em>happen) when you align yourself closely with people like George W. Bush and when you support his war-mongering, catastrophic actions.</span>
</p>
<p>Lieberman's fellow Democrat, the little-known Ned Lamont, challenged for the position of Connecticut Senator in a vote that took place only a few hours ago. The campaign almost entirely revolved around Iraq, with Lamont taking a strong anti-war stance against Lieberman's infamous pro-Iraq position. He has supported the Iraq war since the beginning, and is not in favour of a timetable for troop withdrawal. His many parallels with Mr. Bush on various issues earned him the title, "Bush's favourite Democrat". Lieberman ran for Vice-President in 2000 on Al Gore's Democratic ticket, and attempted to gain the presidential nomination in 2004 during the Democratic primaries.</p>
<p>
<span>In 1998, Lieberman was openly critical of Bill Clinton's behaviour re: Monica (a decision that led to the president's impeachment). As far as I know, Lieberman has only been supportive of George Bush's bloodthirsty decision to invade Iraq. But, look, we all know that oral sex with an intern is far more deserved of criticism and scrutiny. </span>
</p>
<p>For information on Ned Lamont, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Lamont">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ned_Lamont</a>. The importance of Iraq as a political issue has been demonstrated by this result.</p>
<p>
<span>Here's the very interesting online letter that Michael Moore posted on his website shortly after the Lieberman loss.</span>

<span>It's All About Who You Sleep With ... a Cautionary Note from Michael Moore<br />
</span>
</em>
</strong>
</p>
<p>
<span>Friends, </span>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<span>Let the resounding defeat of Senator Joe Lieberman send a cold shiver down the spine of every Democrat who supported the invasion of Iraq and who continues to support, in any way, this senseless, immoral, unwinnable war. Make no mistake about it: We, the majority of Americans, want this war ended -- and we will actively work to defeat each and every one of you who does not support an immediate end to this war. </span>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<span>Nearly every Democrat set to run for president in 2008 is responsible for this war. They voted for it or they supported it. That single, stupid decision has cost us 2,592 American lives and tens of thousands of Iraqi lives. Lieberman and Company made a colossal mistake -- and we are going to make sure they pay for that mistake. Payback time started last night.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<br />I realize that there are those like Kerry and Edwards who have now changed their position and are strongly anti-war. Perhaps that switch will be enough for some to support them. For others, like me -- while I'm glad they've seen the light -- their massive error in judgment is, sadly, proof that they are not fit for the job. They sided with Bush, and for that, they may never enter the promised land. </span>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<span>
<strong>To Hillary, our first best hope for a woman to become president, I cannot for the life of me figure out why you continue to support Bush and his war. I'm sure someone has advised you that a woman can't be elected unless she proves she can kick ass just as crazy as any man.</strong> I'm here to tell you that you will never make it through the Democratic primaries unless you start now by strongly opposing the war. It is your only hope. You and Joe have been Bush's biggest Democratic supporters of the war. Last night's voter revolt took place just a few miles from your home in Chappaqua. Did you hear the noise? Can you read the writing on the wall?</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>
<br />To every Democratic Senator and Congressman who continues to back Bush's War, allow me to inform you that your days in elective office are now numbered. Myself and tens of millions of citizens are going to work hard to actively remove you from any position of power. </span>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<span>If you don't believe us, give Joe a call. </span>
</p>
<p>
<br />
<span>Yours, Michael Moore </span>

<span>P.S. Republicans -- sorry to leave you out of this letter. It's just that our side has a little housecleaning to do. We'll take care of you this November.</span> </p>
