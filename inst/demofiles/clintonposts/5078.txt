<strong>Week Three Features the Demise of Hillary Clinton, the Disqualification of General Wesley Clark, and the Narrow Defeat of The Nashua Advocate's Top Pick for Darkhorse Presidential Candidate, Russ Feingold</strong><br /><br /><em>[EDITOR'S NOTE (5/8/05): Scroll down past Introduction for brackets and voting instructions]</em>.<br /><br />By ADVOCATE STAFF<br /><br />As most of those participating in The Nashua Advocate's Presidential May Madness are aware, General Wesley Clark was disqualified from the Poll this week due to persistent double-voting by his supporters.  The Advocate has since learned of similar accusations against Clark supporters as to other on-line polls.  <br /><br />As Staff has previously (even laboriously) noted, we regret the exclusion of valid Clark votes, in no way imply that this disqualification casts a shadow on General Clark himself, and acknowledge that the solution employed was imperfect but--given the technical limitations of our vote-counting procedure--the best we could possibly do under the circumstances.  This Poll continues to operate on the honor system, though we also reserve the right to disqualify illegal votes (read: multiple-voting).<br /><br />Interestingly, when all the invalid Clark votes were discounted, Former Vermont Governor Howard Dean nevertheless emerged victorious, albeit in the closest race TNA's May Madness has seen thus far.  Small consolation to those who <em>legally</em> cast ballots for Clark, we know--that is, it will do little for their present ire that their favored candidate would have lost this week's match-up in any event--but we note it regardless, for what it's worth.<br /><br />[And to head off at the pass those who would surmise that Dean pulled ahead after Clark's disqualification--because voters eliminated Clark from their ballots--Staff notes that the rate of balloting for Clark remained constant both before and after his disqualification].<br /><br />Of more immediate note is the defeat of Hillary Clinton, "real-world" favorite to nab the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, at the hands of former presidential candidate and Vice President Al Gore, the top vote-getter in this week's Poll.  Staff speculates that it was Gore's CSPAN-televised speech at a MoveOn.org event--in which the former Democratic star sounded resolute and articulate and looked (sans beard, albeit still hefty) somewhat closer to national palatability--that vaulted him into "front-runner" status going into our Final Four.<br /><br />That said, did we mention that current Democratic superstar Barack Obama is still alive after this week's polling?  It will be interesting to see whether Advocate readers predict the first black President in our nation's history for 2008--and even more interesting to see if that black President is not Obama, but John Conyers, the senior-citizen with zero presidential ambitions who nevertheless (as a sixteen-seed!) has made a curious and improbable march through our Poll.<br /><br />Is this the week Democratic voters choose realism over fantasy, the young (or relatively so) over the elderly? <br /><br />And does Al Gore have one more presidential campaign left in him?<br /><br />Will Howard Dean jump ship at the DNC to make a second run for the Presidency?<br /><br />The questions are endless--but that's why we love national politics here at The Advocate.<br /><br />In any event, without further ado, here are the winners and losers from Week Three, along with the week's highlights and awards. Also below are the brackets for Week Four--the Final Four of the contest--which officially begins <strong>right now</strong>.<br /><br />Instructions for voting are at the base of this article.<br /><br />[We note here, for all you technophobes out there, that voting is <strong>easy</strong>, and requires merely sending an e-mail with your picks to our e-mail address, nashuaadvocate@yahoo.com].<br /><br />Week Four voting will close, and all Week Four results will be posted, in one week.<br /><br />Let the voting begin!<br /><br /><em>[EDITOR'S NOTE (5/8/05): As with last week's polling, this week you will once again find active links to information on each of the candidates who survived Week Three, and who therefore now face elimination (or advancement to the Championship) in Week Four.<br /><br />Please remember, also, that we invite, separately from your Week Four votes (albeit in the same e-mail), your nomination of any person for "Top Write-In Candidate for 2008."<br /><p>To find the original post for Week One, click <a href="http://nashuaadvocate.blogspot.com/2005/04/great-debate-who-will-save-democratic.html">here</a>.
