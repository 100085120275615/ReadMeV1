<p>There is <a href="http://www.latimes.com/features/health/la-he-soy8may08,1,4808385.story">no joy</a> in Soyville, says Hillary E. MacGregor of <em>The Los Angeles Times:</em></p><blockquote><p>When soy burst onto the Western food scene in the early 1990s, the possibilities for the bean seemed boundless. The protein-packed legume had potential to prevent breast cancer, increase bone mass, alleviate hot flashes. It seemed to lower cholesterol, and thus to help prevent heart disease.</p>

<p>Millions of dollars were poured into research, and technologists plopped soy into every food imaginable. They ground it into burgers, hot dogs and sausages (Tofurky was born). They processed it into cheese, milk and ice cream. Manufacturers added it to baby formula, and baristas foamed it into lattes.</p>

<p>Purists consumed soy in its traditional Asian forms â as tofu, tempeh or edamame â while hard-core health nuts sought out soy protein powder or isoflavone-packed supplements.</p>

<p>But 15 years later, with ever more soy products available in the grocery store and conspicuous soy consumption a cultural shorthand for "Hey, I'm health-conscious!", the tides are turning against the Asian wonder food.</p></blockquote><p>I guess our household is behind the curve, where a half-gallon of soy milk is now a regular fixture in our fridge, right next to the traditional, cow-produced variety. (Our 16-year-old daughterâand resident expert on all things trendyâclaims to prefer it.) Two Asian-food-loving boys also consume industrial quantities of soy sauce and (occasionally) various soy-based snacks.</p>

<p>But if soy is so fifteen-minutes-ago, then what's hot? Ms. MacGregor doesn't say, but here are some modest suggestions:</p>
