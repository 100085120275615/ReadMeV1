<div>Well, the long knives are out with the race hustlers on the far Left of Virginia's blogosphere (<a href="http://vaprogressive.com/?p=1161">here</a>, <a href="http://richmonddemocrat.blogspot.com/2006/08/george-allen-anatomy-of-melt-down.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://vaprogressive.com/?p=1162">here</a>), and even among some <a href="http://notlarrysabato.typepad.com/doh/2006/08/allen_scandal.html">relatively sensible people</a>.  Of course, the <span>Washington Post</span> has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081400589.html">followed </a>the far-Left blogosphere on this one, with predictably <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081401114.html">contrived outrage</a>.  And while Jerry gives an <a href="http://blogfromonhigh.blogspot.com/2006/08/scandal-explodes-in-allen-campaign.html">appropriately contemptuous view</a> of the whole <span>contretemps</span>, there are <a href="http://tooconservative.com/?p=906">those </a>who regularly give aid and comfort to the enemy doing so yet again.  The paid political hack at Raising Kaine has even <a href="http://www.raisingkaine.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=3925">declared </a>that Senator George Allen said something that "<b>just happens to refer to a monkey and to be a recognized racial slur</b>."<br />
<br />Recognized? By whom? Race hustlers? Tunisians? Once again, Lowell has been dippin' into the Kool-Aid just a wee bit too much if he really believes this. 'Course, who knows what he believes, beyond the paycheck?<br />
<br />Well, I'm convinced.  George Allen, who won't even discriminate against people for their perverse sexual <span>behavior </span>--- he has been described by one homosexual publication as having the most fag-friendly [paraphrasing here] office on the Senate side --- is truly a goober and a racist, making judgments about people's skin color. Nevertheless, he's sophisticated enough to use a racial epithet that would only be recognized in obscure corners of the world.<br />
<br />And I also believe in: the Tooth Fairy; that Bill Clinton really didn't have sex with "that woman"; the Easter Bunny; that HillBilly have a real marriage; Santa Claus; that Governor Marky Mark's tax hike was necessary to avert a deficit; that John Gray is a Republican; and that someday I'll collect Social Security.<br />
<br />What I don't understand is how he was supposed to incite a crowd which probably didn't include people from those obscure corners of the world. Or whether the young, mohawk-headed man in question even understood it as a racial epithet.<br />
<br />Perhaps the funniest and most contrived post of all comes from the paid hack at Raising Kaine, who<a href="http://www.raisingkaine.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=3923"> isn't satisfied</a> with George's apology. Of course, nothing short of a complete surrender and withdrawal from the race would satisfy Webb's nutroots contingent.<br />
<br />Don't bother, George.  You've made your apology.  Unless they're right, and you <span>are</span> a racist and meant it as a racial slur, don't bother to say another word. You'd be wasting your time with people upon whom further efforts would be wasted, and I'm willing to bet that most of the voters in Virginia --- people who are going to or even might vote for you --- recognize that.<br />
<br />UPDATE: Sillier and sillier.  Now Ben is <a href="http://notlarrysabato.typepad.com/doh/2006/08/missed_one.html">claiming </a>that "inside the Beltway" is a racist codeword.  One commenter has it right: Ben has officially jumped the shark.</div>
