<div>San Jose, CA (FN) - Technology pioneers TiVo Inc., developers of the revolutionary personal video recorder technology, today announced the launch of their new reality entertainment suite of products, which the company has dubbed RilVo.<br />
<br />Company spokesman Todd Gesture said the move is a reflection of consumer demand.<br />

</a>"Reality entertainment is the hottest phenomenon in the media this decade. It is not just a TV thing anymore. From internet blogs to radio shock-jocks, the public has developed an insatiable appetite for reality entertainment. Hollywood producers can't keep up with it, but our technology can," said Gesture.<br />
<br />The lead product in TiVo's new line is the RilVo Home Reality Viewer (HRV). Measuring out at a whopping 72 inches, the average HRV is larger than the largest big-screen TVs currently on the market, but is priced competitively at about $10,000 for the hardware along with a $50 per month subscription fee.<br />
<br />"That's a pretty modest price to pay for unlimited, on-demand reality entertainment delivered right to your living room," said Gesture.<br />
<br />Gesture says smaller models will soon be rolled out that can be installed in bedrooms and even bathrooms.<br />

<br />HRVs even have an "green" angle to them. The units are solar powered, although for an additional $5,000 back-up lights are available that allow the HRVs to function at night.<br />
<br />The true show-stopper of TiVo's new line is the MobilRil, a set of cutting-edge mobile reality entertainment viewers, which are set to sell for the eye-popping price of $25,000. Well worth the investment, says Gesture.<br />
<br />"Gameboys, Wi-Fi and cell-phone video are, in the immortal words of Hillary Duff, so yesterday. Our new MobilRil uses photon technology to deliver reality entertainment wherever you go," said Gesture.<br />
