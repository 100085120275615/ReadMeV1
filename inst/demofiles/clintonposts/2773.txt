<div><p>Our alleged elites seem on an endless quest to wrest the definition of morality away from those of us foolish enough to have listened to our parents, pastors or priests.&nbsp; Away from those of us who are unwilling to play God.&nbsp; But if you are smart enough to avoid the mainstream media, you may have missed this very latest folly.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It involves, as is so commonplace today, the abuse of children.&nbsp; The abuse of childhood.&nbsp; The abuse, really, of the entire concept of humanity. And if you are a pregnant woman, or know one, or even pass by one on the street, you too can play this smug, sanctimonious, self-congratulatory game!</p>

<p>Yes, the latest to be scorned and hectored are those parents who, upon receiving a negative pre-natal screening report, refuse to abort the baby.</p>

<p>Genetic Outlaws. Chromosomal Renegades.&nbsp; Evolutionary Saboteurs. </p>

<p>Why the next thing you know, Hillary might have to stock her Villages with imperfect, flawed, normal children.&nbsp; The kind that have to be reared individually, one-to-one, by actual normal adults instead of fed through the pre-programmed overscheduling liberoid superkid generator.</p>

<p>This will never do.&nbsp; Immense social pressure must be brought to bear against those who dare to assume that God knows what He is doing when He creates a person.&nbsp; We have the technology to allow only the photo-op cream of the crop to be born, and by Janet Reno we'd better get with the program. Otherwise the MTV video mills and the glossy tabloids and the child pornographers might run out of pretty smiling faces and perfect young bodies.</p>

<p>Worse yet, a sensitive, caring, tolerant, diversity minded Democratic Voter might actually have to interface with a less than perfect child.&nbsp; They know their Constitutional rights and they're not going to put up with that.</p>

<p>If you were rational, you'd have to wonder that the genetic police and abortion fanatics can't find better targets for their meddlesome lectures.&nbsp; Islamic radicals deliberately create swarms of brainwashed child bombers and endless infant bodies for staged attacks and U.N. observer charades.&nbsp; At home, unmarried, unemployed losers are not only allowed but encouraged to breed.&nbsp; So why must the G.P. harass the employed, law-abiding, married parents whose only crime is to think that a person with Downs syndrome or Autism is still a person?&nbsp; </p>

<p>True, I believe in the obligation to consider the genetic realities before conception.&nbsp; People with serious inherited problems may well choose never to become pregnant.&nbsp; That's quite different from the apparently healthy people who discover during pregnancy that perfection is a little further away than they might have planned, and look to abortion as the solution.</p>

<p>After all, once we start the engine of test-result abortion, where will it run?&nbsp; If it's &quot;moral&quot; to abort a baby with Downs, is it &quot;moral&quot; to abort one with an IQ ten percent under normal?&nbsp; And if this practice becomes so common that most lower IQ babies are aborted and the average IQ goes up, will babies previously considered normal become the new abortion targets?&nbsp; If gross deformities get you aborted today, in twenty years will potentially average looking people get the scraper?</p>

<p>It's easy to champion abortion as a solution to human frailty after you yourself are guaranteed life, liberty and the right to pursue crackpot liberal ideas.&nbsp; It's admittedly not so easy to devote your life to the care of a challenging, imperfect person, even when that's yourself.&nbsp; But faith of all kinds and the long run of history hold that the flawed among us are often the most vital, crucial and productive. Not to mention the most inspirational.&nbsp; Any civilized person out there want to argue that life would be just as good without Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?</p>

<p>Genetic police of all degrees need to be careful what they ask for.&nbsp; As we learn more about the care and feeding of the human soul, we may also learn to fix whatever defect drives people to become liberoids, busy-body sanctity inspectors, genetic police and other blights upon the body politic.&nbsp; A little elective or involuntary tinkering with their brains, and we will have them right back to the way God intended them to be. </p>

<p>Because when you cherish the deeply defective, you cherish yourself.&nbsp; The one and only perfect man already walked this earth, then left the rest of us to share the burdens of being imperfect.&nbsp; There is no other meaning to life and no excuse for those who fail at this elemental task.</p>

<p>The truly wise would never be so presumptuous as to second-guess the Creator of All Life.&nbsp; But if you believe you have the right to abort imperfection, then please get to it.&nbsp; Just remember to set the example and abort yourself first.</p></div>
