<p>Statement of Congressman Brian Higgins</p>
<p>Buffalo, NYâ Rep. Brian Higgins (27th District) released the following statement:</p>
<p>âTodayâs edition of The Buffalo News detailed actions on the part of New York State Assembly Majority Leader Paul Tokasz relative to a fair settlement for Buffalo and Erie County in the Niagara Power Project relicensing process. I want to address issues raised by the Majority Leader in his letter to the New York Power Authority and to the Mayor of Buffalo and the Erie County Executive.</p>
<p>Firstly, I want to thank United States Senator Chuck Schumer for his leadership in calling for a meeting between NYPA and Western New Yorkâs Congressional delegation. Senator Schumerâs actions advance our common objective, which is to secure a mitigation settlement from NYPA that will help rebuild our waterfront. Senator Schumer and his colleague Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton remain steadfast allies in our efforts to being the good people of this region the waterfront they&#8217;ve waited 40 years for.</p>
<p>Secondly, I want to offer my appreciation to Majority Leader Tokasz and welcome his recent involvement in this seminal issue. It is clear from his letter that NYPA appears prepared to offer a more authentic mitigation settlement for Buffaloâs waterfront development. While this offer is less than what I and dozens of other allies have worked toward in this process, the fact remains that the amount cited in his letter is substantially more than the paltry $2 million NYPA initially offered. On balance, this represents progress, positive progress toward a far more reasonable settlement.</p>
<p>If in fact NYPA offers an authentic mitigation settlement, the remaining question is, âWhat entity will receive and be responsible for the planning and expenditure of these funds toward the redevelopment of our waterfront?â One choice â the choice of the Assemblymen â is to keep control of these funds and their expenditure in the hands of a commission based in Albany not Buffalo, with decisions that will be made in the context of the vagaries of Albanyâs political system, and not the needs of our local community. Our other choice is to put the money in the hands of local people in the form of the newly created waterfront development commission â people with a demonstrated commitment to redevelopment of Buffaloâs waterfront, and who are committed to seeing real projects that create real jobs for Western New Yorkers move forward quickly.</p>
<p>The âchoiceâ posed above isnât really a choice at all; itâs a question of keeping the status quo, or taking waterfront development into the new direction that it so desperately needs. The leadership of the waterfront commission shares with me the same frustration and consternation about the progress of waterfront development that all Western New Yorkers have felt for the past 40 years. This represents a clear opportunity to reject the status quo â the old way of doing things â in favor of a new direction and a new way. Letâs not squander it, but instead embrace it, and work together to build the waterfront that we all so desperately want, and that Western New Yorkers so clearly deserve.â
