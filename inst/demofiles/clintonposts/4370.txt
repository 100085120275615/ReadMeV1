<p>A rally at Macedonia Missionary Baptist Church on Sunday, the first question to U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D-IL,  was this:  "I see a Democratic Party afraid to say they're Democrats, who voted for the war in Iraq and voted for tax cuts for the wealthy," said Glenn Anderson of Orlando. "Why should I remain a Democrat?"<br /><br /><img border="0" align="Left" src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v57/Cynder/images.jpg" alt="Image hosted by Photobucket.com" />The answer given by Obama was more revealing than intended.   "The Democrats at times have lost their way," conceded Obama. "We are trying to decide what our core values are."<br /><br /><br />With that lame answer, Mr. Anderson, has likely switched to being a Republican now, like millions of others who've realized democrats have absolutely nothing of value to offer America.<br /><br />Weighing in on the rising costs of health-care, Obama gave his small audience this empty rhetoric -- "We're all getting hurt" -- and the out-sourcing of American jobs. The biggest challenge in the United States, he said, is how to make sure workers can support families in a global economy.<br /><br /> "We're seeing manufacturing jobs leave [America]," Obama said. "We're losing those jobs and ending up at fast-food restaurants with no benefits. Oh, yes, and gas prices are going up."  Reportedly, the audience responded with "hefty" applause to the senator's whining.  <br /><br />But one has to take note that nowhere in Obama's words were any solutions whatsoever. None.  His so-called "star power" is vein and worthless in the long run because it has no basis in reality.  Describing the problem doesn't fix them.  Whining about things won't get the job done, and that is all the democrats have to offer other than feel good rhetoric, because they have no ideas on how to do anything other than raise taxes on the rich, which has now been proven to be a failed idea having the opposite effect of the stated result democrats have promised time and again.<br /><br />Here's what Hillary had to say on Mondy, "There has not yet been one net job created in the last four years" - a claim contradicted by economic statistics. <br /><br />The fact is that job numbers have increased steadily during president Bush's leadership since his predecessor left the nation in a recession after his false bubble-economy popped and millions lost their jobs because of Clinton's huge tax hikes that strangled American corporations and small business productivity.  Last Friday's unemployment was down to <b>5%, the lowest in four years</b> which outs Hillary as the biggest liar in the world.  She just can't face reality!<br /><br />Of course democrats have no answers because they don't even know what they  or America stand for. Oh sure, they say they stand up for the "little guy," but in reality they don't. What democrats do is cater to their wealthy hollywood friends and corporate CEO's with party's and media events offering a lot of glitz and sizzle, but no steak.  How much good does any of that do for the people?  None!<br /><br /> To a litany of social ills, Nelson responded more than once, <i>"I have and will continue to fight for the least of those among us."</i>  What a crock!  <br /><br />Sorry Nelson, but the people want answers, not a continual head butt against the wall that offers no solutions.  Democrats have certainly lost their way and their values are non-existent because they've been exposed for who they are, which are corrupt appeasers who care only about themselves and want to take the people's money away and waste it on inept government programs that don't do squat for anyone, but keep people locked into a bad way of life while promising them better days ahead with more empty words.<br /><br />Senator Obama is all show and no go, as are most democrats at their liberal core.  <br /><br />But he <i>looks</i>  and <i>sounds</i> good, doesn't he?<br /><br /><br /><br /> <br /><small>Sources: http://drudgereport.com/ <br />http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orl-locobama10071005jul10,0,2374313,print.story</small><br /><p>
