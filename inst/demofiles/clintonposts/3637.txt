<div>The topic of partial privatization of Social Security accounts has been a hot topic lately.  Proponents argue that privatization will fix a broken system that is hopelessly in need of help.  Opponents argue that privatization is the path to ruin and that nothing is wrong with the current system.  Unfortunately, these arguments only scratch the surface and donât touch on the real issues.  <br />
<br />According to the Social Security Administration, as of December 2004, there were approximately 40 million retired or dependents of retired people on Social Security.  Thatâs about 1/5th of the U.S. population almost entirely dependent on the government for their livelihood.  By 2030, this number is expected to grow to 70 million.   <br />
<br />In addition to the millions of retirees dependent on the government for Social Security, sixty four thousand (64,000) people work for the Social Security Administration.   Thatâs one employee for every six hundred and twenty-two beneficiaries.  Also, if we figure the average 2.3 people per U.S. household, thatâs another 150,000 people that are dependent on the U.S. government.  Taking this further, using the expected 70 million beneficiaries in 2030 we can expect over 110,000 government employees just administering Social Security.  Thatâs not smaller government. <br />
<br />In order to accomplish the ongoing goal of Conservative reform we need to look down the road and understand the way these programs are going to grow and understand that this ongoing growth is diametrically opposed to the idea of smaller government and personal freedom from government involvement. <br />
<br />Additionally, these government workers and beneficiaries are one of Liberalismâs last bastions of guaranteed support.  âTax and tax, spend and spend, elect and electâ was once championed by big government proponent and FDR New Deal aide Harry Hopkins, in recognition of the fact that these programs and these jobs provide an ongoing base for Democratic Party recruitment. <br />
<br />When, then First Lady, Hillary Clinton was charged with reforming health care and ended up proposing an enormous bureaucracy to manage the new Colossus to be created, she had that famous quote in mind.  Fortunately, so did Conservatives across the country and they killed the program before it went any further. <br />
<br />The idea of Social Security has always been for the U.S. Government to reflect the compassion its citizens and provide a safety net for retirees and those who canât fend for themselves.  Unfortunately, Social Security from the beginning was more about âSocialâ-ism rather than security. <br />
<br />As long as contributions remain mandatory, why do millions of Americans need to get a check from the U.S. Government?  Couldnât it just as easily come from a Fidelity Investments?  In todayâs age of 401k accounts, IRAâs, and college savings plans, the market has established itself as a much better provider of financial results and personal options that should be offered by the Social Security system.  The market competition inherent in these programs also ensures that they are run as efficiently as possible to maximize returns to the customer.<br />
<br />In order to achieve President Bushâs vision of an âOwnership Societyâ in which people look to themselves to create wealth rather than the government, these steps need to be taken. <br />
<br />Finally, one of the big secrets the tax and spenders donât want you to know is that if we allow for partial privatization of Social Security, it will be more difficult for excessive spending to occur and force a true examination of government spending.  The Federal Government has unfettered access to borrowing funds from the trust fund and keeps writing IOU after IOU further ballooning the national debt.  As a result the true capital needs of the U.S. government are not realized because of this accounting scheme.  Instead of making more money which would immediately drive up inflation and hurt the economy, the federal government instead borrows with impunity.  Even more disconcerting is that foreign investors are purchasing more and more of this debt.  This compromises our national security by indirectly placing our economic decisions in the hands of foreign governments that may choose to do us harm.   <br />
<br />If Conservative reform is to be truly successful we must reinvent the myriad of socialist programs that have been created over the last 50 years to embrace markets and competition.  We must look at privatizing Social Security as the next big step in getting our arms around out-of-control government spending.  By doing so, we can ensure that the idea of smaller government and less government interference and involvement in peopleâs lives continues to be something we can realize both now and in the future.</div>
