<span><strong>Spotlighting Supporters and Haters</strong><br /><br /><span>As has been written about many times here in recent months, Louisianaâs Congressman, Bobby Jindal-R, has been pushing for his bill, H.R. 4761, which gives Louisiana and other Gulf states a bigger portion of the offshore oil & gas royalties out of the Gulf of Mexico and opens up millions of acreage in the Outer Continental Shelf for exploration. The bill passed, with some amendments and pandering to Florida, who apparently believes their tourism industry is more important than the economic security of the country, with a vote of 232-187.<br /><br /></span></span><a href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2006/roll356.xml#N"><span>House Voting Record</span></a><br /><span><br />Notable Representatives who voted AGAINST Louisiana are: Dennis Kucinich-D, a favorite of far-Left kooks; Patrick Kennedy-D; Kathleen Harris-R, a âconservativeâ who put aside Louisianaâs coastline protection and national security for her stateâs tourism, Maxine Waters-D; Nanci Pelosi-D, why doesnât California just form its own damn country?<br /><br />Notable Rep. who voted WITH Louisiana and for less dependence on foreign oil are: Charles Boustany-R; John Edwards-D, again, this should not have been a partisan issue, though it did turn out that way in the Senate for partisan Democrat hacks; Sheila Jackson-Lee-D; Bobby Jindal-R, the billâs author and pusher; Jack Murtha-D; Tom Osborne-R; Ted Poe-R, one of the co-authors and a personal favorite of The Conservative Cajun.<br /><br />The bill was then sent to the Senate and filed under Senate Bill 3711. From there, drastic changes were made, such as reducing Louisianaâs share of royalties to an UNFAIR amount. Nevertheless, the bill was then voted on and passed, 74-25.<br /><br /></span><a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00219"><span>Senate Voting Record</span></a><br /><span><br />Here, many Democrats decided to turn this into a partisan issue and vote against Republicans, voting against Bobby Jindal and Louisiana.<br /><br />Notable Senators who voted AGAINST Louisiana: Joe Biden (D-DE), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), again, CA, what a surprise; Robert KKK Byrd (D-WV), the guy started his own klan group; Dick Durbin (D-IL), also spends his time aiding and giving words of support for terrorists; Russ Feingold (D-WI), an ass that comes from a state whoâs newspaper whined about âunfairâ revenue increases for Gulf states; Diane Feinstein (D-CA); Ted Kennedy (D-MA), put down the bottle of whisky long enough for this vote; Barack Obama (D-IL); Olympia Snowe (R-ME), this fake conservative should be voted out next time.<br /><br />Notable Senators who thought they had something better to do that day than vote: John Kerry (D-MA); Joe Lieberman (D-CT)<br /><br />Notable Senators who voted WITH Louisiana: George Allen (R-VA); Hillary Clinton (D-NY), WOW, this is a surprise, thanks Hill!; John Cornyn (R-TX); Bill Frist (R-TN); Lindsay Graham (R-SC); Mary Landrieu (D-LA), word is she threatened to leave her party if her colleagues made this a strict partisan issue; Trent Lott (R-MS); John McCain (R-AZ), now he just needs to realize that amnesty for illegal aliens is dumb; Rick Santorum (R-PA); Chuck Schumer (D-NY), another big surprise, thanks Chucky; David Vitter (R-LA).<br /><br />Both of Floridaâs senators voted YES, after we had to pander to them. Both of Californiaâs senators voted NO. To much surprise, both of New Yorkâs senators voted YES. To no oneâs surprise, Massachusetts was no help and voted NO and ABSENT.<br /><br />Organizations who are helping in this fight for the Gulf Coast:<br /><br /></span><a href="http://www.americasenergycoast.org/"><span>America's Energy Coast</span></a><span><br /></span><a href="http://www.americaswetland.com/"><span>America's Wetland</span></a><br /><a href="http://www.crcl.org/"><span>Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana</span></a><span><br /></span><a href="http://www.restoreorretreat.org/"><span>Restore or Retreat</span></a><br /><span><br />Individuals/bloggers who have voiced support for the Gulf Coast and have encouraged the revenue sharing bill:<br /><br /></span><a href="http://www.houstonenergyanalyst.com/"><span>Alan Lammey: Houston's Energy Analyst</span></a><br /><a href="http://www.louisianasportsman.com/"><span>Louisiana Sportsman Magazine</span></a><br /><span>Todd Masson: Editor, Louisiana Sportsman Magazine<br /></span><a href="http://theponderingamerican.blogspot.com/"><span>The Pondering American</span></a><br /><a href="http://cajuntiger.blogspot.com/"><span>Shane Comeaux: Cajun Tiger</span></a><br /><a href="http://righthandthief.blogspot.com/"><span>Oyster: Your Right-hand Thief</span></a><br /><a href="http://www.supertalk975.com/psshow.html"><span>Jim Pruett and Brian Shannon</span></a><br /><span>John Hill: Chief of Louisiana Gannett Capital Bureau<br /></span><a href="http://www.thedeadpelican.com/"><span>Chad Rogers: The Dead Pelican</span></a><br /><span><br />The fight is not over, though. The reduced percentage passed by the Senate bill is a joke. Louisianaâs coast is eroding faster than any other land in the United States. We have offered our lands for exploration and pipeline access for production and transportation of domestic and foreign petroleum energy. Now is the time for our state to start being compensated justly. Louisiana rightfully deserves the same share of royalties that Texas receives.<br /><br />To all those that are helping in this fight: Thank you, but please continue.<br /></span><br /><span>To all those who have thumbed their noses at us such as California, Massachusetts, Florida, Jeb Bush, Wisconsin, Kucinich, and all partisan hack Democrat senators: Kiss our rears and start paying $8 a gallon for your gasoline.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Update:</span><br /><span></span><br /><span><a href="http://www.ccalouisiana.com/cca/">CCA of Louisiana</a>, in their latest publication, has displayed full support of Bobby Jindal's bill.</span>
