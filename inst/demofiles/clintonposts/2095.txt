<blockquote>âI want us here in New York to imagine, if extremist terrorists were launching rocket attacks across the Mexican or Canadian border, would we stand by or would we defend America against these attacks from extremists?â Mrs. Clinton said to roars of approval.<br />

</blockquote>Is Ms. Clinton advocating we should kill great numbers of random Canadians to retaliate for the work of Canadian extremist terrorists?  What if the rocket attacks weren't from Canada or Mexico, but from Boston or Detroit?  Would Ms. Clinton crater Logan International Airport?  Would Ms. Clinton advocate killing great numbers of random Americans in Michigan?<br />
<br />Israel should immediately cease all military operations in Lebanon and Gaza and withdraw.  The settlements in the West Bank need to be dismantled and the settlers moved back into Israel.  Build the wall but build it to the '67 border.  Then just as Israel is bracing for peace it will be attacked.  Bus bomb.  50 dead.  Israel should respond only through diplomacy.  It will be attacked again.  Restaurant.  50 dead.  Again, diplomacy.<br />
<br />International opinion will be strongly on Israel's side and each attack upon Israel is condemned not just by Israelis but by the world community, who appeal to the people living in the country to do something to stop the attacks coming from that country.  And they eventually do.<br />
<br />If Israel can continue to stay within its now internationally-recognized borders and make no provocative moves, then the opportunity arises within the less politically-developed countries that are seen as hosting the terrorists to create policies that promote peace and we should do everything we can to provide for the means of their enforcement.<br />
<br />No violence for one day makes an excellent start.  Before you know it you have ten days without violence.  This is how peace happens.  Every day you can add that is violence-free makes it all the more likely the next day is violence-free as well.<br />
<br />Ten years of this and peace is almost being taken for granted.  Connections start to develop between key figures in industry and government.  A precedent is set for doing business.  Deals are made.  Economic interdependency takes root.  Before you know it the whole region becomes a free trade zone.  We disagree about history and religion but we agree about roads and sewers and food and medicine.<br />
<br />That could be Israel's future.  If you and I were having a conversation in that future I would point to the two deadly suicide-bombings that took place so long ago, and the innocent lives that were lost, but lost for the very best of reasons; to better secure the opportunity of life for everyone else, to give us this future that we would be celebrating on that day.<br />
<br />Sadly, based on the events over the past few days, as well as sentiments such as those expressed by Hillary Clinton above, that future now appears to be several decades further away than it did last week.  We know what these next few decades will be like in that part of the world because we've been through this already.<br />
<br />And we know well too how many Israelis will die.  Well, we don't exactly, we just know that it will be more than the 100 Israelis who died in that alternate universe where Israel pursues peace.  A lot more.<br />
<br />Less Jews die my way than Hillary's.<br />
