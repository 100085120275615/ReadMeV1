We have a mixture of Democrats and Republicans crossing party lines and are either pro or con on this issue and there of course has been some politicizing which is normal along with some politicians distorting the facts. Again, normal.<br /><br />Former President, Jimmy 'Peanuts' Carter sees no problem with the deal. That my friends, should be an automatic 'red flag'.<br /><br />Suprisingly the unofficial spokesman for Arabs, Al Gore has not yet released his opinions on this matter but I am certain he will pop up again in the near future to bash Bush. However, this time it appears our G.W. is in alignment with the former veep which in turn must have Al walking in circles and in a state of confusion.<br /><br />Hillary Clinton has become the HAWK on this issue as has Chuck Schumer which astounds me in one respect since both had a problem with renewing parts of the Patriot Act which is as important to our security as is the sale of our ports. Hillary seemed to ignore the fact that the same ports now being discussed are in fact operated by a British company, P&O.; She stated "Our port security is too important to place in the hands of foreign governments," said Mrs Clinton. I have also heard Barbara Boxer come out against this sale.<br /><br />The ports in question are in New York, New Jersey, Baltimore, New Orleans, Miami and Philadelphia. Peter King a Republican representative from N.Y. responded to the deal with "The immediate goal to freeze the contract and to look into it more carefully".<br /><br />The consensus of those who are against this deal is for the administration to step in and block the transaction. He is also denying in a way, the fact that the hijackers who hit us on 9/11 were in fact 3 citizens of U.A.E. On that fact alone the message needs to be sent that we will not allow this transfer to occur based upon principle alone. This whole issue should not even be up for debate since we are at war with countries who support our destruction with some individuals who happen to be of U.A.E. descent. The UAE was used as a financial and operational base by some of the 9/11 hijackers. A country who have voiced support of the Taliban.<br /><br />Clinton and Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., expect to offer a bill to ban companies owned or controlled by foreign governments from acquiring U.S. port operations. In the House, Reps. Chris Shays, R-Conn.; Mark Foley, R-Fla.; and Vito Fossella, R.-N.Y., are among those who want to know more about the sale. In a House speech, Foley said, "The potential threat to our country is not imagined, it is real."<br /><br />This all transpiring at a time where many still believe our ports are still not secure as they should be. Although the day to day operations will still be managed by the same employees who currently perform the job, the business side of the operation will be operated by the U.A.E. company. I am uncertain what laws are in place that would kick in if Dubai Ports World were to enact some dubious practices affecting the six ports in their control. The potential for problems has not been seriously addressed and any transfer must be stalled until all the facts are in and even then this should not be a done deal. Unfriendly nations ought not be permitted to purchase or operate any properties vital to our security.<br /><br />You just don't trust a fox in the chicken coop.<br /><br />What is next? Maybe the transfer of our public schools to the Islamic United Front?
