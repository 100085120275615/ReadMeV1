<div>"Mrs. Clinton, how do you spell liberal?"<br />
<br />"E-X-P-L-O-I-T." And Hillary Clinton is our spelling bee winner.<br />
<br />At a gathering of Irish immigrants, Mrs. Clinton accused Bush of trying to create a police state by wanting to round up millions of illegal aliens, nearly three-fourths of her <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/18/AR2005071801530.html">voting base</a>, and ship them back to their homeland. <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/03/08/sen_clinton_slams_gop_immigration_bill/">Article Link</a>

<br />Well, she's got some kahonas, I'll give her that. But what is hard to understand, (well, not really), is why she would make this speech to a room full of immigrants who came to this country the legal way? Surely she realizes that they, like the rest of us, are pretty sick and tired of the hand outs these illegals are getting.<br />
<br />In typical liberal fashion, the situation of one group can either be applied to another or used for political gain. On the issue of equality for homosexuals, liberals generally use the oppression of the black population in the '60's as fuel for the debate. When they wanted to paint Bill Clinton as some kind of advocate for the little disabled guy they wheeled Christopher Reeves on stage at the 1996 Democratic National Convention. And in their fierce opposition to the war in Iraq they shamelessly used an unstable, grieving Cindy Sheehan as their mouthpiece. (Sheehan, however, has yet to realize she is no longer on the dem's payroll.) So, in their scary little minds, it makes perfect sense to think of legal Irish immigrants as just the bunch to have on board in their quest for tolerance toward illegal immigrants.<br />
<br />The big glaring difference between the Irish and the Mexicans, aside from the fact that one group was legal and the other isn't, is that, for the most part, the Irish were grateful to be in America. No, it wasn't easy and there was discrimination and a few riots here and there, but the Irish persevered and came to America on America's terms, i.e., learning the language and paying taxes. And because of that they have become an invaluable segment of our culture.<br />
<br />But when it comes to the Mexicans sneaking over the border, they not only don't have a desire to speak our language, they are getting the joy of watching America trip all over itself trying to accommodate such arrogance (or laziness, I'm not sure which.) <a href="http://cbs4denver.com/local/local_story_061125200.html">Can't profess to be English speaking American</a>

<br />In Hillary's comment, "<em>Don't turn your backs on what made this country great", s</em>he doesn't seem to realize she is doing just that. By allowing clemency to illegals she is essentially spitting in the faces of those immigrants who have done their time standing in lines, filled out mountains of paperwork, and are actually contributing to the betterment of this country. Those people, not the ones sliming in under the cover of darkness, are the ones who have made this country great.<br />
<br />In a four page letter to constituents, Hillary supported allowing some of the estimated 11 million illegal workers to earn citizenship.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<em>Such changes should include "a path to earned citizenship for those who are here, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar for becoming a citizen," Clinton wrote.</em>

</p>Hmmm, working hard, paying taxes, respecting the law, and willing to meet a high bar for becoming a citizen?  Forget the illegal aliens, it would be nice if we could expect as much from the liberal democrats.</div>
