<p>Elizabeth May is Best Choice for Green Party Leader<br />
By Gregory D. Morrow</p>
<p>The Green Party of Canada is quickly becoming an important player in Canadian politics. For example, in the last election, 25% of Ontario&#8217;s ridings were decided by margins that were smaller than the Green Party&#8217;s share. So, with so many close ridings, how Green Party supporters vote will often determine the outcome of an election. And the Greens are growing quickly &#8212; from 104,402 votes in 2000 to 664,068 in 2006 &#8212; a more than six-fold increase. With the environment now the second most important issue to Canadians after health care, there is good reason to believe that the Greens are well-positioned to once again increase their vote in the next election. And with efforts to tweak how we translate votes into seats, it is clear that we will see Green MPs in the near future.</p>
<p>This growing support makes the Green Party&#8217;s current leadership contest all the more important. Who the Greens choose will ultimately impact how much media attention they receive but also put pressure on the other parties to make sustainability central to Canadian politics. Three candidates are vying for the leadership: long-time St Catherines Green candidate Jim Fannon, Ottawa candidate and former deputy party leader David Chernushenko, and one of the country&#8217;s best-known environmental activists, Elizabeth May. The race is between Chernushenko and May, and they offer the Greens two very different options.</p>

<p>Given the internal battles waged between the progressive left and the often right-wing direction that former leader Jim Harris took the party, there is a sense that new blood might be just what the doctor ordered &#8212; someone to unite the different factions &#8212; a sentiment similarly felt within the current Liberal leadership race. That favours May, especially in light of some negative campaigning from Chernushenko&#8217;s camp. Moreover, it was clear to anyone watching the Green leadership debates that Elizabeth May is an articulate and engaging speaker, who earns the respect of even non-Greens for her ability to speak succinctly. So while Chernushenko is a strong, knowledgable Green advocate, and deserves a central role in the party, it is hard to see the Greens turning down the opportunity to elect May. A leader must inspire others to join the party, something that May can do. A leader must also have a broad network in which to amplify the party&#8217;s message &#8212; in the media (particularly important for the Greens), within non-government organizations, and with MPs and Senators in Ottawa. And there is little doubt that May has a strong network, being a personal friend of Bill Clinton, and having served as Senior Policy Advisor to the Environment Minister under Brian Mulroney. This network is central to raising the profile of the Green Party. As a regular commentator on environmental issues, May&#8217;s election as leader of the Greens will ensure they are given a voice in the mainstream media.</p>
<p>In a recent conversation, a policy director for one of the Liberal leadership campaigns told me that &#8220;Elizabeth May is going to cause all of the parties a lot of trouble,&#8221; which I took as a positive for the Greens. More than just her network and media profile, May brings 20+ years of experience fighting for a more sustainable Canada, and recognized expertise in all things environmental. As weather becomes more extreme, the number of smog alerts rises, and more and more children are diagnosed with asthma, it is increasingly clear that &#8220;being green&#8221; can no longer been seen as the purview of &#8220;tree-huggers&#8221;. Indeed, the environment isn&#8217;t just another line item in the federal budget, it is quite literally the stuff that surrounds us. It&#8217;s about acheiving social and economic goals through sustainable practices. More so than government regulation, being green is about encouraging average Canadians to make better choices in their everyday lives. Small relative to the world powers, Canada has long looked for an opportunity to lead the world. Given our vast resources, our affluence, and our smarts, Canada can be a global leader in sustainability if we so choose. It&#8217;s our thing. And in a tightly-fought political climate where a few seats matters, the election of even a few Green MPs would be a giant leap forward in Canada fufilling its destiny as the global leader in sustainability. With a high-profile leader like Elizabeth May, the Greens are well-positioned to capitalize on what Canadians of all stripes are beginning to sense: that the environment isn&#8217;t just about saving the birds and the beetles, but rather, it&#8217;s about building a prosperous Canada without compromising our home and native land.</p>
