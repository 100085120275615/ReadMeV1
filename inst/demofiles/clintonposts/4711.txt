<p>Perfect?  Nope, but dam far from the dire predictions many of the liberals and welfare advocate groups claimed in 1996.</p>
<blockquote><p>The law, which reversed six decades of social welfare policy and ended the idea of free cash handouts for the poor, was widely seen as a victory for conservative ideas. When it was passed, some opponents offered dire predictions that the law would make things worse for the poor. But the number of people on welfare has plunged to 4.4 million, down 60 percent. Employment of single mothers is up. Child support collections have nearly doubled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the slickmiester agrees&#8230; but of course he does, he was perfect right?</p>
<blockquote><p>âThe bill has done far more good than harm,â Mr. Clinton said. âMost of the people who got jobs are still working.â &#8230;  When the 1996 law was passed, Democrats like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, liberal advocacy groups like the Childrenâs Defense Fund and liberal academics predicted that it would increase child poverty, hunger and homelessness. The predictions were not fulfilled.</p></blockquote>
<p>None of the data or news is a surprise, what is shocking is that is was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/washington/21welfare.html?ex=1313812800&#038;en=3bd83021ded17ec2&#038;ei=5088&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss">printed in the NY Times</a>.  Just something to keep in mind the next time major changes are proposed for an entitlement program and the doom and gloomers get behind their bullhorns.
