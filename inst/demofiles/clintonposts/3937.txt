<p>Very interesting.  I currently own hillaryclintonphoto.com, hillaryclintonpicture.com, hillaryclintonbiography.com and <a href="http://hillaryclintonnaked.com">hillaryclintonnaked.com</a> lol.  Well, I AM going to use these domains.  Not to worry Hillary, I don&#8217;t have copies of those photo&#8217;s.  I&#8217;m thinking about a political blog of some sort with both sides represented.  Anyone have any better ideas?
