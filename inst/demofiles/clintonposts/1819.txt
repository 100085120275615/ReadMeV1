<span>Several years ago, someone told me that Julie Andrews was Tori Spellings mother. At the time I thought, âwhat a shame Tori didnât get her motherâs looksâ. I never bothered to do any kind of research on whether this was true or not because letâs face it, I could give two shits less about Tori Spelling. I can also toss in Lindsey Lohan, Hillary Duff and Paris Hilton into this vat of âI could care lessâ. So tell me anything you want about them, Iâm not expending any kind of energy to find out if it is true or not.<br />
<br />So any way, Iâm getting my hair done the other week when I read in one those celebrity magazines that Toriâs mother kept her away from her fatherâs death bed. But her mother wasnât Julie Andrews. So that got me thinking of how much âcelebrity knowledgeâ I donât have and just talk out my ass. And it is funny how with friends and people at work, weâll get in arguments over this celebrity or that celebrity, but yet none of know what we are talking about.<br />
<br />Like when the whole Christy Brinkley scandal went down. There was actually a heated discussion in my office on how many times she has been married and how many kids she has. Only thing anyone could agree on was that she was married to Billy Joel and had a daughter with him. So while every one was arguing, I decided to Wikipedia her ass and find out the skinny.<br />
<br />So thatâs advice according to Pudâ¦if you have to expend any kind of energy on researching a celebrityâ¦use Wikipedia. Because it is the bible of everything donât you know.<br />
