<div>We're not going to Georgia.<br />So, like I said, we aren't very good planners.<br />Don't invite us along on vacation because you'll probably get mad that we didn't do our share when it comes to planning. Just a warning.<br />We prefer to plan as we go.<br />Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.<br />We sat at the computer (well, Dave sat at the computer I sat in a pile of fabric and pins and sizzors...more to come) for 2 1/2 hrs yesterday while the kids were sleeping and resting.<br />We decided that we wanted to use FF miles to fly.<br />Choosing your destination 2 weeks before you travel leaves little to be desired.<br />We were able to choose from Georgia and South Carolina however the flight wouldn't have gotten us home until after the kids bedtime and we really wanted to have them come pick us up at the airport.<br />We could have gone to New York or Florida, but like I said Florida is one we want to use later, and if I'm going to NYC I want to plan a little bit.<br />We could have gone to California, but Dave's been traveling there a lot this year and I didn't want to go to a place he's been to 10 times this year.<br />Then, Dave said, "We could go to Rhode Island. There is this place called Block Island"<br />I said, WAIT! I know <a href="http://simone007.blogspot.com/">someone </a>who goes to Block Island!! I think she loves it!<br />We then got on <a href="http://www.blockisland.com">www.blockisland.com</a> and we were hooked.<br />We're going to Rhode Island!<br />I never in a million years thought I'd be going to Rhode Island.<br />That is what is cool about our tradition, never knowing what state will come up next.<br />Sorry Hillary! :) Simone, I'm going to email you and get info (like if there is a restaurant you recommend or things to see....)<br />------------------<br />I am SUPER excited about a new addition to <a href="http://www.milobaby.com">our store</a>. (sorry, I do that just to keep family and friends from happening to come here while searching for...well, our store)<br />I can't give away the secret just yet, but lets just say that I am literally up to my eyeballs with fabric, pins, sizzors, patterns etc..... I'm super lucky to have a MIL who used to sew their entire wardrobe. We are collaborating together and we're going to reveal our big secret addition at the expo we're taking part in in 2 weeks.<br />This is something that won't only be for babies, but preschooler type age.<br />Wish us luck!!</div>
