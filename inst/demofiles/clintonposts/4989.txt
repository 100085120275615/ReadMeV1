<span><strong>Ann Coulter Victimized by Former âMisogynist-in-Chiefâ<br /></strong><br />(New York) Former President Bill Clinton, evidently not satisfied with bringing dishonor to the White House, today attempted to bring dishonor to Americaâs sweetheart by allowing his out-of-control wife to </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/coulter.911.widows.ap/index.html"><span><strong>question patriotic pundit Ann Coulterâs views on 9/11</strong></span></a><span> (âThe Day That Changed EverythingÂ©.â) As if that werenât enough, the former presidential philanderer later inappropriately propositioned the virginal vision of virtue by, according to reliable sources, inviting her to join Clinton and his sexually-ambiguous wife for a night of âbi-partisan bi-sexualityâ at the Waldorf-Astoria the Clintons list as their official New York address.<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4470/1753/1600/Ann%20Coulter.jpg"></a><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4470/1753/1600/Ann%20Coulter.0.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4470/1753/400/Ann%20Coulter.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />âNow I know how Monica felt,â credibly sobbed a clearly offended Coulter to womenâs rights advocate Rush Limbaughâs national radio audience. âFirst they questioned my womanly abilities, and then they tried to take advantage of them. Iâd ask if they have no shame, but we all know that question was answered long ago.â<br /><br />Coulterâs traumatic ordeal began early in the day, when she and âSenatorâ Clinton crossed paths at a 5th Avenue Barnes and Noble. Coulter, of course, was there to appease the thousands of right-thinking Americans waiting in line for her autograph on the next great piece of American literature, Godless: The Church of Liberalism, while âHedonist Hillaryâ was engrossed with her daily purveying of the retailerâs offerings in the âAmerica-Hatingâ section. Thatâs when Clinton, displaying a false sense of entitlement âearnedâ by engaging in a sham marriage with Americaâs worst President, lumbered to the front of the line and accosted the nationâs nicest neo-con.<br /><br />âHillary, all the while trying to look down my blouse even though it was buttoned to the neck, called me a âdirty, dirty girlâ for questioning the motives of the 9/11 widows, and also panted that âI need to be spanked.â Coulter responded by calmly summoning her Secret Service detail, who briefly detained the pseudo-New Yorker while Coulter bravely retreated from the scene in an armor-plated Humvee.<br /><br />Believing the ugly incident was behind her, Coulter relaxed while enjoying high tea at the Waldorf, when she was approached by a âwaiterâ bearing a disturbing resemblance to Al Gore. This member of the servant class delivered a hand-written note etched upon old, fading White House stationary inviting chaste Coulter to join the writer (self-identified as âBubbaâ) and âthe old ladyâ in the ex-Presidential suite. Displaying the kind of grace under pressure exclusive to conservatives, Coulter instead paid the âwaiterâ a small sum to take her place in the suiteâs sexual sickness. âIf heâs a Democrat, Iâm sure he enjoyed it,â correctly surmised Coulter, a prim-yet-mischievous grin upon her face.</span>
