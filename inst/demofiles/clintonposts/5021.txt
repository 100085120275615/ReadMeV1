<span>OK. I really have wanted to post, I just haven't had the time/computer access. If you like Hillary enough to read this blog in the first place, you probably found all the recent HRC news items on your own anyway! So enough apologies...<br /><br />I went to a Hillary fudraiser in the Lower East Side last Friday and feel obligated to share my experience (and my crappy photos) here. So let's begin...<br /><br />First of all, I realize in retrospect that I should've bought two tickets for the event. For some reason I didn't realize that this was an option until I was actually leaving the event. Because I am a doofus.<br /><br />So yeah, I went to this thing by myself. I don't normally have tons of money to throw around, but I'd just gotten a quarterly bonus, so YAY for me. I didn't really know what to expect from the event (I got a "flyer style" email advertisement and that was it), but I knew that<br />A) there was a musical act<br />B) there was a "dj following the Senator's remarks" and<br />C) there was an hour of open bar.<br />So at the very least I know I could drink and stand around bouncing my head to the music.<br /><br />Which is pretty much what I did. I hoped maybe I would run into someone I could talk to, (either accidentally or out of friendliness) but that didn't happen. (Well, I developed a deep rapport with one of the bartenders, but otherwise- nothing) Virtually everyone there was with a date; those not with dates were in unpenetrable groups of 3-5. What was more painful was that almost everyone looked pretty cool and more or less in my peer group (30-35 politically active New Yorkers- SQEEEE!). So I just stood around for about 90 minutes, drinking rum & cokes and trying not to look like a loser with no friends. :D<br /><br />They were selling</span><span> </span><a href="https://www.friendsofhillary.com/contribute2/tshirts/"><span>tee-shirts</span></a><span> </span><span>in the lobby and after awhile I bought one! At first I gravitated towards pink (and was informed by the volunteer that pink was their best seller- HEE!) but I ultimately got a blue one (like the dude's in the top picture). Then I drunk-dialed my boyfriend to tell him the dj was playing "Somebody's Watching Me" by Orange Juice Jones.<br /><br />Eventually, lights were dimmed and it was obvious that the "musical act" was about to come on and I snagged this opportunity to plant myself on the dancefloor. Now I must admit that the name John Legend didn't mean anything to me when I showed up to this thing, so I had no idea he'd actually be, you know, good. But he was. </span><a href="http://www.johnlegend.com/"><span>Check him out</span></a><span>.<br /><br /></span><span>Afterwards, the dj announced Hillary's warm-up act. He described someone who was "an inspirational democrat" and I expected someone like </span><a href="http://www.millerfornewyork.com/blog/"><span>Gifford Miller</span></a><span>. </span><span>Instead, it turned out to be... </span><a href="http://www.italian-american.com/mario-cu.htm"><span>MARIO CUOMO</span></a><span>! </span><span>Awesome!! I admit I was pretty drunk at this point, but that was a totally cool surprise. I should also point out that I was like, only 2 or 3 persons deep in the crowd... which was cool, except that I'm a 5'5" woman and there were some taller dudes in front of me blocking my view. (Whatever. Story of my life...)<br /><br />Finally Hillary came on and she was GREAT! :) I took some crappy digital photos, starting with </span><a href="http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/overduefilms/detail?.dir=4c09&amp;.dnm=af45.jpg&.src=ph"><span>this</span></a><span>, </span><span>and followed by </span><a href="http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/overduefilms/detail?.dir=4c09&amp;.dnm=776b.jpg&.src=ph"><span>this</span></a><span> (note the dude's big, balding head in my way...), and eventually </span><a href="http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/overduefilms/detail?.dir=4c09&amp;.dnm=fc7a.jpg&.src=ph"><span>this</span></a><span>. </span><span>After those three I figured they'd be more or less all the same, so I quit taking shots between the dudes' heads.. though I did manage to get </span><a href="http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/overduefilms/detail?.dir=4c09&amp;.dnm=5e82.jpg&.src=ph"><span>this one</span></a><span> </span><span>of Cuomo, John Legend and Hillary together.<br /><br />After she was done, Hillary came offstage and started to shake hands, pose for pictures and generally mingle a little before (presumably) making her exit. Now one thing I <em>really, really, really hate</em> is pushing my way through a crowd to get anything... a seat on the subway, a giveaway, a glimpse at a celebrity, WHATEVER... I hate it and I won't do it. However, at this point<br />A) I was fairly tipsy...<br />B) I already spent the whole evening feeling somewhat socially inept and<br />C) I paid $100 to get in.<br />So I thought SCREW THIS; I'm getting as close as I can to Hillary.<br /><br />So I waited my turn as politely as possible (I took</span><span> </span><a href="http://pg.photos.yahoo.com/ph/overduefilms/detail?.dir=4c09&.dnm=b1f3.jpg&amp;.src=ph"><span>this picture</span></a><span> </span><span>shortly before we shook hands) I rehearsed in my mind the following line: <em>"Senator, would you mind if I took a picture?"</em> at which point I would flip my camera around and Hillary and I would pose for the camera positioned at the end of my extended arm. I drunkenly rehearsed this line in my head like, 3 times and it was cool. I had my line down.<br /><br />The only problem was that when I got face to face with her we were kinda diagonally facing each other... In other words, there was no possible way I could contort myself to get us both in frame together. My line was shot! As I shook her hand I had to drunkenly improvise and here's what I came up with: <em>"Senator, thank you so much for coming!"</em> ?!?!?!?!??!<br /><br /><em>Thank you so much for coming???????</em> I don't even know what I meant by that. Did I think she was at my house? The hell?!?<br /><br />The awesome part was that she totally laughed at me! :D HA! It was too loud to hear exactly what she said (or maybe in my humiliation I just willfully blocked it out), but judging from her facial expressions and tone it was either:<br /><br />A) dude, you shelled out a c-note for this thing. Thank YOU for coming!<br />B) are you high?<br />C) It's my fundraiser, of course I'm here. Dummy! But you know...you're welcome! xoxo<br /><br />Next time I am bringing my boyfriend! :)</span>
