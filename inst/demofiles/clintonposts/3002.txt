<div>Did you just read a <a href="http://plaidberry.blogspot.com/2005/07/word-about-politics.html">semi-rant</a> against politics on this blog?  Uh, well, my attention span is kinda short and has consequently drifted back into the political realm.  Rest assured, however, that I'm still sick of it though and I meant every word I said.<br />
<br />But after reading <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/georgewill/gw20050707.shtml">an article by George Will</a>, I'm reminded about the man I think could be the next President.  (HT: <a href="http://www.stonescryout.org/archives/2005/07/george_allen_fo.html#comments">Stones Cry Out</a>)  That would be Senator George Allen from Virgina.  I initially made <a href="http://plaidberry.blogspot.com/2005/03/contenders.html">this prediction</a> several months ago.  <br />
<br />If he runs in 2008, he will win the Republican nomination.  If he wins the Republican nomination, he has a very good chance of being elected President (I think, I hope, fingers crossed...)  The thought of President Hillary is already sending chills up my spine.  This guy is the best hope for the GOP.  Just listen to him talk some time.</div>
