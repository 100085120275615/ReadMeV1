</a>If one reads the scriptures correctly, the traveler assisted by the Good Samaritan was a crime victim.<br />
<br />Recently, a ranch owner on the border assisted some illegals on his property with food and water before calling Border Patrol. They claimed he abused them and sued in American courts and were given the deed to his ranch. Where was Hillary when this landowner lost his home for being a good Samaritan?<br />
<br />Looks to me like we are assisting the criminals and punishing the crime victims. But I guess that is too close of a reading for Hillary. The Bible talks about those who call evil "good" and good "evil." I think it was talking about Hillary. What's hard to understand about the word "illegal"?<br />
<br />Doesn't Hillary Clinton realize that using this GOP bill by saying it would criminalize Jesus makes her look like a prostitute? I hope the American people can see through the scam this woman is trying to pass off as concern for the teachings of the Scriptures. She is the only person in this country that is actually a bigger liar and thief than her husband, and it makes me cringe to hear this woman even mention the name of Jesus as if she really cares.<br />
<br />Her statement that "this bill is not in keeping with her understanding of the Scriptures" is not surprising considering her past activities, crimes and general behavior. Her statement demonstrates her complete lack of understanding of the Scriptures. She would be well-served to actually read the Scriptures instead of using them in an attempt to gain votes.<br />
<br />Using the analogy that the GOP would criminalize Jesus shows just how truly ignorant this woman is. Since when does Hillary Clinton care about Jesus or the Scriptures? I would guess that she will be caring more and more each day until after the elections, and then she will blend right back in with her constituency that wants God removed from our currency, from our schools or better yet outlawed completely due to the possibility of offending a member of the only religion recognized and accepted by liberals: Islam.<br />
<br />God help this country if Hillary Clinton is ever elected president.</div>
