<span>You may be familiar with the Church Sign Generator. Or maybe not. Turns out the guy who created it has a whole bunch of generators and "Says-Its," available here: <a href="http://www.says-it.com/">http://www.says-it.com/</a>. Make your own vinyl records (or if you're too young to remember vinyl records, find out what I'm talking about). Create your own concert tickets -- but don't try to sell forgeries, please. Put words in the mouth of Hillary Clinton, GWB, Chuck Norris, Pope Benedict, and others. Or put your own graffiti on the moon.</span>
