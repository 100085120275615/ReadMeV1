<br />We are going to have a steady stream of guests in town for the next few weeks, so <span>At Our Table</span> will be on a little hiatus.<span>  </span>Iâll be spending time entertaining our visiting friends and family and time at the computer to post entries will be limited.<span>  </span>Iâll be back with a few <span>new recipes</span> and I have <span>restaurant reviews</span> of <span>Mon Ami Gabi</span>, <span>Janeâs</span>, <span>Hillaryâs Urban Eatery</span>, and other Chicago spots to share.<span>  </span>If youâd like to be alerted when the next post is added to At Our Table, look to the left-hand side of the screen to the Notify List box and join my e-mail updates list. <p class="MsoNormal">

 And now for something completely different...<br />
</p> <p class="MsoNormal">Here are a couple of my new favorite finds.<span>  </span>The first is <span>York Dark Chocolate Dipped Cookies with Peppermint CrÃ¨me</span>.<span>  </span>I bumped into these at the grocery store recently and they are amazing.<span>  </span>They are so minty and fresh.<span>  </span>Just like a York Peppermint Patty but with the crispy crunch of a cookie.<span>  </span>So, so good that we plowed through one box dangerously quickly.</p>     <p class="MsoNormal">

<br />My other obsession of the week is <span>Trader Zen Grapefruit Chamomile Sea Salt Scrub</span> from <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">Trader Joeâs</a>.<span>  </span>I rarely look at the beauty products at Trader Joeâs but recently I stopped to peruse them.<span>  </span>I love this grapefruit scrub.<span>  </span>It smells wonderful and leaves your skin exfoliated, soft and smooth thanks to its blend of sea salt and oils.<span>  </span>My aesthetician friend recently saw my elbows and pronounced them âin excellent condition.â<span>  </span>I had used the scrub that morning and Iâm sure my gleaming elbows where the result of the scrub.<span>  </span>While my elbows arenât exactly high on my body priority list, Iâm not going to turn down the chance to have excellent ones.<span>  </span>The bright grapefruit scent leaves you and your bathroom smelling great.<span>  </span>This scrub is reasonably priced, so effective and a real treat for the senses.</p>     <p class="MsoNormal">

 So those are two fun things to check out next time you hit the grocery store.<span>  </span>Back in a couple weeks with more food news, recipes, and restaurant reviews.  Until then, happy summer!<br />
