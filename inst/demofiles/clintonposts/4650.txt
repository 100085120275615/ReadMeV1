<p>Let me get this straight...</p>

<p>1) They're angry with Gore because he didn't fight it out in 2000.<br />
2) They're angry because we went to war in Iraq and a Gore victory would've prevented that.<br />
3) They support Hillary, even though she's been 100% supportive of this war.<br />
4) They don't want Gore to run because it might get in Hillary's way.<br />
5) They support Gore's message in his new movie.</p>

<p>So given all that, <a href="http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060623/NEWS02/60623004">they show up and protest his movie and a book signing</a>.</p>

<p>That's pretty stupid.</p>

<p>Yet another reason why I never participate in protests.</p>
