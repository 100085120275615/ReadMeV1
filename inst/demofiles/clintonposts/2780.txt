<div><p>Read this by Thomas Sowell:&nbsp; <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=16609">Point of No Return</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;...Then vote Republican! </p>

<p>A key quote:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>&quot;This is not just another in the long history of military threats. The Soviet Union, despite its massive nuclear arsenal, could be deterred by our own nuclear arsenal. <strong>But suicide bombers cannot be deterred</strong>.&quot;</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">We can't hide behind the oceans, or stop all the plane flights and ships.&nbsp; We have to get these bastards before they get us.&nbsp; I'm sorry if that offends your patrician sensibilities, but I'm not willing to place the safely of my family in the hands of a John Kerry, Howard Dean or Hillary Clinton.&nbsp; And having John Conyers and Carolyn Kilpatrick in Congress &quot;defending us&quot; is no better. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Think about it:&nbsp; if Hillary can't talk Bill out of boffing all those women, how in the hell do you think she would be able to talk that Iranian madman out of nuking Israel?</p></div>
