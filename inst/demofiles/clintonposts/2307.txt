<p>To my DVD-collecting friends who manage to score great films in the most unexpected places, these are the new documentaries Iâve been wanting to see, depressing as they may be.<br />

<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0301555/">God Grew Tired of Us: The Story of Lost Boys of Sudan</a>
</span>  <span>
<br />This documentary tells the story of four Sudanese boys who make the journey from their home country to the United States after years of wandering war-torn Africa. Made in 2004, </span>    <span>the film is narrated by Nicole Kidman and produced by Brad Pitt.<br />

</span>
<br />
<span>Nominated for an Oscar in 2005 and recipient of many international awards, this documentary follows the lives of five women as they struggle to rebuild their lives in the aftermath of the 1994 </span>    <span>Rwandan genocide. Rosario Dawson narrates.</span>

<span>God seems to feature prominently in many film titles from this region. Well, if there was ever an argument for a God-forsaken hell on earth, I suppose Central Africa could be it.</span>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<span>No matter how crazy it gets here in the Philippines, I would like to believe that itâs never going to be as bad as it is in Central Africa. I think it is indicative of the degree of decay in our civilization when there is this kind of unrestrained pathos and rage in the very birthplace of humanity.</span>

<span>OBAMA!</span>
</span>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<span>Speaking of Africa, US Senator Barack Obama is going to visit his fatherâs home country of Kenya in August. Kenya seems to be doing much better these days due to the resurgence in popularity </span>    <span>of safari tourism. In fact, Kenya has TWELVE CondÃ© Nast Gold List hotels and resorts while the Philippines only has two (the Pen and Shang).</span>
<span>
<br />
</span>
</p> <p>
<span>Anyhow, back to Barack. When I watched him on TV (at the 2004 Democratic National Convention) punctuate his impassioned <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/convention2004/barackobama2004dnc.htm">âThe Audacity of Hopeâ</a> speech with âE pluribus unum: out of many, one.â I almost wept. If this world was a better, more principled world, Obama would be elected President of the United States in 2012 or 2016. Oh but Iâm sure Hillary has a different take on that.</span>
</p> <p>
<span>Just a thought: If Barack does end up going against Hillary for the Democratic nomination, will Oprah secretly throw her support behind Barack because he's African-American or behind Hillary </span>    <span>because she's a woman?</span>
<br />
</p> <p>
<span>
<span>DROP THE DEBT</span>
</span>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<span>Speaking of politics, Russia (just because theyâre doing so well with oodles of money coming in from oil sales) has decided to forgive the debt of several poor countries. Woohoo! I donât think the </span>    <span>Philippines has outstanding loans with Russia, but woohoo nonetheless.</span>
<span>
<br />
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>However, as I am a conspiracy theorist at heart, I still prescribe to the idea that Third World foreign debt was never meant to be paid off because it is this burden of debt that keeps us enslaved by the First World. Even as they profit from our eternal interest payments, they use our debt as economic and political leverage to change our policy and manipulate our commerce in their favor (just look at everything from our foreign investment policy to how we lost the rights to our own <a href="http://www.mindfully.org/GE/Relive-Green-Revolution-Horror.htm">ylang-ylang</a> </span>
<span>and <span>nata de coco</span>).</span>
<span>
<br />
</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Then again, with Bono and Bob Geldof rallying the troops, itâs still nice to think that maybe we can make a difference. So we sign the <a href="http://www.live8live.com">Live 8</a> petition (I even joined the <a href="http://www.g8rally.com">virtual G8 rally in Scotland</a>, haha) and we march with our white bracelets and we hope that Someone Who Matters actually cares. And despite the constant feeling that weâre lost in a mob of souls waging an uphill battle (wow, this blog is really clichÃ© central today) there are good weeks like this when a country like Russia decides to sayâhey what the heck, you guys are off the hook. Woohoo!</span>

<span>PHILIPPINE IDOL</span>
</span>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>Dios mio</span>, <span>nag-</span>audition<span> ba talaga ang lahat ng tao sa</span> PICC? Iâm so afraid <a href="http://www.philippineidol.com">Philippine Idol</a> is going to be uber-cheesy (and I bet Ryan, Francis, and Pilita </span>    <span>are all fighting over who gets to be Simon), but I know Iâm going to watch it anyway.</span>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>AMERICAN IDOL (OR, KAHIT TALO ELLIOTT ROCKS!)</span>
</span>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>Because deep down inside, Iâm just another pathetic fan girl. I realize itâs been several weeks since the finale, but you can still hear <a href="http://www.yaminmachine.com">Elliott Yamin</a> on my speakers almost every day. Today's top three favorite performances (thanks to <a href="http://www.rickey.org">

</a> for the mp3s): <a href="http://www.homegrownart.net/trouble.mp3">Trouble</a>, <a href="http://www.homegrownart.net/somebodytolove.mp3">Somebody to Love</a>, and <a href="http://www.homegrownart.net/asongforyou.mp3">A Song for You</a>.</span>
