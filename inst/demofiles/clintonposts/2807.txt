<div><p>The last time I posted, I admittedly reprinted drivel that was a lie. </p>

<p>I often choose not to do this for the sake of debunking untruths. If you reprint to counter, sometimes you just add momentum to the âmy brakes are out!!!â garbage truck and you widen the audience of people behind the lie. </p>

<p>It bothers me the way this conflict is offering a 24/7 mouthpiece to people who are splinter fringe groups on the far left. The voices heard is a message of hate and a message of âI hate America.â These splinter groups, much like Islamic hijackers they admittedly support, have unfortunately hijacked the real voice of the Democratic Party. The silent majority of true Democrats who comprise the bulk of the population are being drowned out by the ultra-left. No, I am not saying that all Democrats belong to the fringe, but the voice out in left field is what is heard. </p>

<p>The Democrats, perhaps even unwillingly, house voices of the opposition. Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Barbara Boxer all do not represent the best interest of the Nation at large. They are merely opposers. </p>

<p>I have a lot of friends that are Democrats. It pains me the party does not change things in the front office to become more competitive. (I am a Cleveland Browns fan, I am entirely too familiar with this concept). If they rule the cities in elections and the Republicans fare better elsewhere tells me there is a demographic crisis in what to believe. I believe that 80 plus percent of the American people are in the middle. I believe it is common that Republicans are left of Democrats. I believe it is common that Democrats are more conservative than Republicans in their beliefs. </p>

<p>So how does it get all gacked up? </p>

<p>Enter the political machinery... </p>

<p>Nobody likes to lose an election, everybody likes to support the winner and have the group that they are the member of in charge. I can also say that no elected official has ever âfought for meâ or âworked tirelessly for meâ nor cleaned up crime or drugs or provided better defense. They vote. They originate documents. They serve as YOUR mouthpiece. Both political parties are rampant with forwarding the Party's agenda, NOT THE POPULATION'S! </p>

<p>So if this is the case, what do you do? Be yourself, vote how you believe, not the little letter next to the name on the ballot, and know this one simple truth: He who shirks from this fight we find ourselves in and thinks we need to negotiate or âlive in harmonyâ with those who want the infidels dead will doom this country to great suffering. It is all about defense today. Read below a piece I got from <a href="http://theodoresworld.net/pages/troopstoday.htm">Wild Thing</a>. Check her BLOG out that supports the troops in country. This young Corporal says it best </p>

<p>~Howdy Shutting Up... </p>

<p>For all the free people that still protest. </p>

<p>You're welcome. </p>

<p>We protect you and you are protected by the best. </p>

<p>Your voice is strong and loud, </p>

<p>but who will fight for you? </p>

<p>No one standing in your crowd. </p>

<p>We are your fathers, brothers, and sons, </p>

<p>wearing the boots and carrying guns. </p>

<p>We are the ones that leave all we own, </p>

<p>to make sure your future is carved in stone. </p>

<p>We are the ones who fight and die, </p>

<p>We might not be able to save the world, </p>

<p>Well, at least we try. </p>

<p>We walked the paths to where we are at </p>

<p>and we want no choice other than that. </p>

<p>So when you rally your group to complain, </p>

<p>take a look in the back of your brain. </p>

<p>In order for that flag you love to fly </p>

<p>wars must be fought and young men must die. </p>

<p>We came here to fight for the ones we hold dear. </p>

<p>If that's not respected, </p>

<p>we would rather stay here. </p>

<p>So please stop yelling, put down your signs, </p>

<p>and pray for those behind enemy lines. </p>

<p>And then when the conflict is over and all is well, </p>

<p>be thankful that we chose to go through hell. </p>

<p>Corporal Joshua Miles </p>

<p>and all the boys from 3rd Battalion 2nd Marines </p></div>
