<p>He&#8217;s one of the most popular politicians in the country. He&#8217;s one of the hottest fundraising tickets around. His second book, due out this fall, is sure to be an instant best-seller.</p>
<p>So why is the most obvious candidate for president, Barack Obama, left out of all the polls? And more importantly, why are only a scattered few in his party publically calling on him to run for president? </p>
<p>This one seems like a no-brainer. Obama comes across as likeable, honest, sincere. He doesn&#8217;t use inflammatory rhetoric. He is trustworthy. If Obama runs, he would beat Hillary Clinton. No question about it. And he would beat any of the Republican candidates, with the possible exception of Guiliani. Although that is better than Hillary, who would not beat Guiliani, and would have greater difficulty against McCain and others.</p>
<p>Obama, also, has the progressive credentials to ward off a strong Green Party campaign. Hillary, on the otherhand, would no doubt draw a major third party candidate. In fact, anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan has already protested Hillary for her support of the war, and may launch a presidential bid if Hillary is the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p>But Obama is not going to run unless the public, and his fellow elected Democrats, begin calling for him to run. And first in line should be Chicago Mayor Richard Daley; in many ways, these two need each other. Obama needs Daley&#8217;s pull on a national level to build support across the country, and Daley, if he&#8217;s going to rise above the City Hall hiring scandals, needs to show that he supports good goverment types like Obama. Lisa Madigan, also, could benefit from an early public show of support for an Obama presidential campaign, with the hopes that he would repay her with his support in 2010, or whenever she decides to run for governor.</p>
<p>The consequence, of course, is that anyone who supports Obama now might alienate Hillary, who is a political heavyweight in or out of the White House. Nevertheless, Obama is the better candidate and would make a better president. So why not be the one to help get the ball rolling?
