<div>On my way to work today; as I was spacing out and trying desperately not to speed; I saw a motorcycle cop on the North bound lane of the Coast Highway, STOP all oncoming traffic. Low and behold, coming from the Pebble Beach on ramp - Secret Service. About 20 Motorcycle cops (or secret service) and a huge black Limo. Apparently either Carrying Bill and Hillary, or?<br />
<br />Apparently, the Clintons, Tony Blair, The Israeli Prime Minister and yes, Nicole Kidman and a whole bunch of other important dignitaries are in town.<br />

<br />On another note, I gotta love my job!<br />
<br />Man walks in and wants to purchase a 4.4 Million dollar, yep, FIXER UPPER! He's putting over $3,000,000 down. Could buy the dang thing out right, but doesn't! Makes over 1.5 Million dollars a month! <em>YES A MONTH! </em>You DID read that correctly! Has over, Pfffff $30,000,000 in the bank -<br />
<br />Ok...seems like I might have chosen the wrong career path? LOL!<br />
<br />Still, this is not unusual for this area. Oh well...gotta love it!</div>
