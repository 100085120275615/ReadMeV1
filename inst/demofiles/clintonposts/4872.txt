<p>Well, a week ago the Democrats went over the edge and  began eating their own in a desperate and unsightly act of political cannibalism.  The longtime Democrat Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut lost his bid for re-election in the primary to a leftwing loony by the name of Lamont.  Lamontâs only resumÃ© credit of any notice is his bulging bank account, and as any political activist knows, âmoney is the motherâs milk of politics.â  Never mind that Lamont is a flaming liberal who just doesnât get itâ¦the war on terror is the only thing that counts right now because if the war is not won, nothing else matters.  So whatâs the real difference between Lieberman and Lamont, Lieberman gets it.</p>
	<p>Since the liberal nutters in the blogoshpere have taken control of the Democrat party, there is no room for the likes of a Lieberman, Scoop Jackson (of times gone by), and Zell Miller.  These men, who had a sense of reality and what it takes to remain the land of the free and the home of the brave, are hard to find in the Democrat party of today.  Itâll be very interesting when Hillary Clinton has to face the issue of whether she supports a Lieberman or a Lamont come the next presidential race.  </p>
	<p>Anyway, there are many true Democrats, not liberals, who reach for the Tums every time the name Lamont appears in the news.  But take heart, just like Howard Deanâs leadership of the DNC, Lamontâs senatorial campaign is the gift that keeps on giving to the Republicans.  Whenever one of these political morons opens his mouth the Republicans gain another convert.</p>
