</a>The focus this week was decidely on 2006 and not 2008.  So <em>Political Roads</em> is not surprised that there wasn't great changes in the 2008 rankings for the Democratic and Republican nominations.<br />
<br />On the Democratic side, the rankings have <strong>Hillary Clinton </strong>(42.3%), <strong>Mark Warner </strong>(19.1%), and <strong>Al Gore </strong>(16.2%) far ahead of the rest.  Except for <strong>John Edwards </strong>(8.5%), the rest of the Democrats are far behind.<br />
<br />On the Republican side, it continues to be <strong>John McCain </strong>(38.3%), <strong>George Allen</strong> (16.2%), and <strong>Rudy Giuliani </strong>(14.3%), with <strong>Mitt Romney </strong>still polling a respectable (11.7%).</div>
