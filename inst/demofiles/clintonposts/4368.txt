<p>A new <a href="http://canisius.edu/newsevents/display_story.asp?iNewsID=3386&strBack=%2FDefault%2Easp">poll</a> out of your Rudy for President Blog's blogger's alma mater sees Rudy Giuliani as the presidential frontrunner for 2008.  "[Sen. Hillary] Clinton loses among voters in the red states, which is no surprise, but Giuliani breaks even in the blue states," noted Canisius political science professor Michael V. Haselswerdt.</p>

<p>Giuliani was the preference of 49 percent of the 501 adults polled nationwide in a hypothetical matchup with Sen. Clinton.  Clinton got 34 percent of the vote.  Disregarding 46 "don't know/undecided" responses, Giulani led 54-38.</p>

<p>Respondents identified themselves by political affiliation as so: Republican 30 percent, Democrat 28 percent, Independent 24 percent.  Eleven percent were not registered voters.</p>

<p>In other interesting data, "if a presidential recall election were possible, only 42 percent would vote to fire President Bush, while 53 percent would vote to have him remain in office," the poll said.</p>
