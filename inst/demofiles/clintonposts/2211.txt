<h3> 2784 The Zogby Bio Poll</h3>  The <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/whispers/articles/060820/28whisplead_2.htm">USNews </a>reports the outcome of a John Zogby poll where voters get only a brief bio, but no name, to choose a candidate. <br />
<br />The 2008 line-up <br />
<br />The Democratic order and percentage:<br />Mark Warner (former Gov. VA), 14.8; <br />retired Gen. Wesley Clark, 14.2; <br />Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold, 12.2; <br />Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh, 11.1; <br />former Sen. John Edwards, 10.4; <br />Sen. Hillary Clinton, 5.6; <br />New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson, 5.3; <br />former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel, 4.9; <br />Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry, 4.9; <br />Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, 3; <br />Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, 2.8. <br />
<br />The Republican rankings: <br />Newt Gingrich, 21.4 (whom I wouldn't vote for based on his personal life); <br />Sen. John McCain, 13.3 (ditto); <br />former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, 11.2; <br />Rep. Tom Tancredo, 9.9; <br />Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel, 6.1; <br />Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, 5.8; <br />Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, 5.6; <br />Virginia Sen. George Allen, 4.9; <br />Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback,4.3; <br />Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, 3.8; <br />New York Gov. George Pataki, 2.8.<br />
<br />However, people don't base their vote on information, voting record or reasoning, but on emotion pumped up by the opponent's side, so I wouldn't get too worked up about this.</div>
