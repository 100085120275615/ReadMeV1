<strong>In Congress, where numbers are everything, the math on the Patriot Act suddenly seems to be moving in favor of Sen. Russell Feingold.   He was a minority of one four years ago, when the Wisconsin Democrat cast the lone Senate vote against the USA Patriot Act in the traumatic weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks. The law, he said then, gave government too much power to investigate its citizens. Ninety-nine senators disagreed.</strong>

<strong>The new Senate arithmetic that emerged this week is enough to place the renewal of major portions of the law in doubt. It was enough to inspire Senate Republican leaders to consider a backup plan in case Feingold's filibuster threat succeeded. Enough to prompt President Bush to dispatch Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to Capitol Hill twice in two days to lobby on the accord's behalf.</strong> (</span>

<span>This is, potentially, a huge victory for the good guys (us) in Bush's war on civil liberties.  With Republicans jumping on board, Bush could be dealt another serious blow.  As usual, my question is, why in the hell are the rest of the democrats not speaking out against this legislation?  Why on earth would you choose to be on the side of someone with a 38% approval rating?</span>

<span>Sen. Feingold is on a serious roll in the last few months, and his ability to reach across the aisle on important issues like this make him a serious threat for the democratic nomination in 2008.  Just the fact he has been against the war from the beginning and was the only senator to vote against the Patriot Act in the first place gives him, in my eyes, a better chance to truly unite the party than Hillary.  I would hate to lose him as my senator, but, if he decides to run for president, I will be behind him all the way.  </span>
