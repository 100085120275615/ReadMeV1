<div>I decided this past trip to the library to pick out some good ole' fashioned YA books!<br />The first one I finished was a story about a girl named Hillary who was into the white supremacy movement.  She had a boyfriend who was higher up in her group who she thought loved her but through an accident she is forced to be stuck in a hospital bed drifting between life and death.  <br />While Hillary is in between consciousness and being on death's door she dreams she is living back during WW2 and her name instead is Chana, a Jewish girl whose going through the whirl wind of war torn Poland.  Through her transportation back in time Hillary sees that her determination to hate is what would end up killing her.<br />This was a quick, but powerful read:)</div>
