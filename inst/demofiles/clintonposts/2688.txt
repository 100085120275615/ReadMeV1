<div><p>Believe it or not--and you almost certainly <em>won't</em> if you've checked out the <a href="http://baronofdeseret.typepad.com/baronblog/2006/07/thou_art_neithe.html">abortion thread</a> from last week--but I'm not a Hillary Clinton hater.</p><p>I wouldn't call myself a <em>fan,</em> mind you, but I'd consider
voting for her sooner than Kerry, Gore, Howard Dean, or virtually
anyone else on the Democrat side other than Joe Liebermann or (maybe)
John Edwards.</p>

<p>Why?&nbsp; For the most part, Hillary (like her husband) is adept at
avoiding extreme positions, instead staking out the middle ground--the
'compromise' position, between the two ends.&nbsp; Being largely a middle
ground person myself, I can respect the effort to at least make some
attempt to understand and bridge the gap between the two extremes,
since very few things are black and white.&nbsp; I think more moderate
policies would do a lot to solve any number of societal issues.<br />
</p>

<p>The problem comes, however, when staking out a 'middle ground'
position for the sake of compromise&nbsp; does not have a solid logical
foundation--when it is merely drawing a line between two points and
putting a marker in the middle, just to <em>be</em> in the middle, regardless of whether that point has a rational basis.</p>

<p>An example: <br /><strong>Side 1:</strong> Polygamy is okay and should be legal<br /><strong>Side 2:</strong> Polygamy is wrong and should NOT be legal.<br /><strong>The &quot;Compromise&quot;:</strong>&nbsp; Allow polygamy, but in a limited capacity.&nbsp; A man can have up to three wives legally, but no more.</p>

<p>This middle ground position attempts to find that point between the
extremes that both sides can accept...however it has no logical basis: 
if polygamy is really okay, with no harmful effects on society or the
men or women who participate in it, then why the restriction at three? 
What makes having three wives okay, but four wives not okay?&nbsp; (<a href="http://baronofdeseret.typepad.com/baronblog/sslessons/beard1.html">Beard Principle</a> alert!)&nbsp; If polygamy is not 'okay'--if it's oppressive or hamrful, then why should it be allowed in the case of two or three?</p>

<p>Some
issues require a value judgment: is X okay or not?&nbsp; Rather than resolve
the issue by finding common ground everyone can agree on, you've
created a solution that avoids and muddles the issue instead--a
solution that probably NO one will be happy with, because it's
essentially trying to say X is both okay AND not okay in the same
breath.&nbsp; Some issues require taking a stand on a principle, and middle
ground solutions with no rational basis aren't going to satisfy anyone.</p>

<p>
(Imagine a 'compromise' solution to marijuana legalization that says marijuana can be bought, sold, and smoked on <u>Thursdays</u>
of every week--but was illegal every other day.&nbsp; The same fundamental
questions apply: if marijuana use is bad, why should it be legal <em>any</em> time?&nbsp; If it is not, why should it be <em>restricted</em> it at all?)</p>

<p>
Granted, it is frequently impossible to make a case for one side or the
other conclusive or persuasive enough that people will switch sides and
everyone will agree.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean you should accept a
'compromise' answer that fails to resolve <em>any</em> of the key questions--<em>it means you just continue talking and/or arguing about it</em>. 
Or you put it up to a majority vote, and the larger group gets their
way.&nbsp; Middle ground answers may have a use in shutting people up (and
if you've ever grown very, very weary about the constant debate on
abortion, immigration, etc, this may be an attractive proposition) but
many issues involve questions that require straight answers.&nbsp; And if
the answers aren't immediately available, then we should wait until
they are, instead of trying to accept an illogical compromise that no
one likes.</p>

<p>
As discussed in the previous thread, I believe someone who attempts to
find middle ground in the abortion issue by simultaneously saying
abortions are 'bad' (to appease one side) but should still be legal (to
appease the other) are on a very shaky foundation, because the reasons <em>why</em>
abortions would be bad, but should still be legal don't line up with
one another.&nbsp; Whether this is just politicking to sound more moderate
in a run-up to a potential presidential candicacy, or if Sen.Clinton is genuinely
conflicted on the issue remains to be seen, but in this case I don't
think the middle ground is going to cut it...</p></div>
