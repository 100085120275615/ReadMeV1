<br />I first heard about the United Arab Emirates (UAE) buying 6 U.S. ports last week.<br />
<br />But a funny thing happened on the way to the media frenzy we see now. <br />
<br />Dick Cheney accidentally shot a man and all real news was ignored for 10 days while the press went after the VP like he was the Anti-Christ.<br />
<br />Now we have this situation where I, like most Americans when they first heard it, thought that this port deal would never happen, that there must be a mistake. I was going to rush out a Matworld Blog and join the debate. I was getting a lot of email asking me what I thought.<br />
<br />But I decided to WAIT a few days to LEARN what the FACTS are about this port deal. Unlike the press and both the Republicans and the Democrats, I waited for the facts. <br />
<br />I am STILL leaning against the deal on common sense grounds of not having a middle-eastern nation controlling our ports, but I have sensed that the reasons for this deal are bigger than what it seems. The facts make this port deal seems the perfect split for politicians depending on where they stand on many issues. <br />
<br />But I also think the paranoia being exhibited by many on BOTH sides of the issue is outrageous.<br />
<br />Think about the following as you make up your minds:<br />
<br />The UAE has airbases we use and will need when we go after Iran. They are also a major ally in The War On Terror.<br />
<br />The Homeland Security, Treasury and State Departments all signed off on this after a full security review, knowing that security is still going to be handled by the U.S. Coast Guard and Homeland Security AFTER the deal closes.<br />
<br />How do we stop this deal without looking like we are racially profiling our economic and free trade issues? Itâs OK for a British firm to own the ports, but not an Arab one?<br />The Democrats screaming about this are now seen as not only profiling Arabs for being Arabs, but are also now ADMITTING we have an enemy and that there IS a âWar On Terror.â <br />This will come back and haunt them with their lunatic-fringe base.<br />
<br />Why would the UAE pay $8 Billion if they are planning on destroying the ports they are buying? The company buying the ports is a well-respected company around the world.<br />Why would they risk that all for a terror attack? They know we will be handling security at the ports. <br />
<br />President Bush blew this by not getting out in front of this last week, even though this was reported in the financial press last fall. <br />
<br />The problem with this is that it takes a 30 second argument to make the deal look bad. <br />âSix U.S. Ports are being sold to an Arab company!â<br />
<br />But it takes a long time to discuss the facts and to THINK about them.<br />
<br />It is time to think about all this now and to slow the process down. <br />Politicians are running at the mouth and foaming about what they perceive to be the problem. <br />The media had run this up to a fury state and is only now looking into facts.<br />
<br />But this is where we are now.<br />
<br />EVERY story is the perfect attack on Bush, Republicans and Karl Rove. <br />No one in the media waits any longer to see what is what, they run with the story and make it up as they go along.<br />
<br />As people learn about this they are starting to think about a compromise on how to work this out. The Maryland Governor was totally against the deal yesterday but now is thinking about how to make it work. In a few days the talk will be how to do the transaction without making the U.S. look racist.<br />
<br />The irony is now the Democrats look like the ones who want the world to hate us because of a free trade issue. THEY want to tick off the Arab world where it hurts, the wallet.<br />This is the perfect way to push them into siding with the terrorists. <br />
<br />If free trade and capitalism can help destroy the Soviet Union and push China into reforms, why canât it help stop the spread of terrorism in Arab countries?<br />If we back out of this deal now we will do exactly what the Democrats say we are doing in Iraq, angering the Arab Street and pushing them into hatred of the United States.<br />
<br />The sad thing is the way this was handled has made Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer look strong on security, when we all know that is the farthest thing from the truth. <br />The deal is actually being PUSHED by Democrat lobbyists that work with ex- Senator Tom Daschle and Clinton Secretary Of State Madeline Albright.<br />
<br />In Matworld this port deal is looked at extensively so a correct decision can be made.<br />We get FACTS and information before we make an International incident out of this. <br />We waited 14 months to go to war in Iraq to appease the world, but now we are rushing this strange deal?<br />
<br />I am the first to be partisan on most issues, but this one is SO involved and important I canât side with anyone until we see more on this.<br />
<br />In Matworld we WAIT until we scream about an issue, and then we decide what the best course of action is. <br />
<br />I am very tired of the constant media frenzy over every hangnail and perceived slight.<br /> <br />Everything is now the sinking of the Titanic.<br />
<br />Itâs time to look at the issues longer and with better thinking and reasoning.<br />
