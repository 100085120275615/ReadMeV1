Everyone's talking about Joe Lieberman's defeat in Connecticut, so I guess I should too.  The thing is, I don't have much to say, and I'm feeling rather ambivalent about the entire business.  I agree with those (Like Jacob Weisberg at Slate) who argue this is a sign that the Democratic Party is overreacting to the anti-war tilt the public has taken, and that we risk falling over the cliff in McGovern '72 territory.  I'm not convinced this is true -- McGovern had a lot of problems beyond his stance on Vietnam and the Cold War, not least of all the fact that he was a craven coward, whose decision to dump <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Eagleton"> Eagleton</a> from the ticket was just another of the million ways in which McGovern was just as ambitious and manipulative as President Nixon, but lazy and stupid to boot.  There are things to admire about McGovern (his attacks on Jimmy Carter spring to mind) but to blame his defeat only on his general attitude on security issues is a little limited in scope, and gives voters too much credit for being keyed in to policy debates.<br /><br />2008 will be a very different year than 1972, but we should still worry that the increasingly aggressive "netroots" activists, who have claimed they "own" the Democratic Party, will install themselves as a left-wing junta, delusionally believing the voters agree with them based on their low approval for the President.  But the President won't be on the ballot in 2008, and Democrats will have to run for something, not just against Bush.  And what will be running for?  Pampered rich boys like Dean and Lamont who pose as progressives at the opportune moment?  Withdrawal from Iraq?  That can be accomplished in the first 100 days of a Presidential term.  What then?  Where's, to borrow from Mondale borrowing from Wendy's, the beef?<br /><br />I take a very dim view of DailyKos and the other MoveOn types who seek to hijack the party.  They don't want to return us to our progressive roots.  If they did, they'd never have supported Dean, whose progressivism was phony and transparent.  Instead, they want nothing more than bloodbath politics, slaying their enemies for deviations real and imagined.  They want to exert their control for the sake of doing so.  It's a powergrab worthy of McGovern and Gene McCarthy, another bullying opportunist who cared more about his own political power than real policy.<br /><br />[Kos has even suggested that Lieberman's independent bid will be flaunting the will of the people of Connecticut.  Connecticut, where 45% of all voters are unregisted and turnout in the primary was 43%.  So, somewhere are 12-15% of all Connecticut voters cast ballots on Tuesday, and almost half of them supported Lieberman.  Lamont's support so far is from 7% of all Connecticut voters.  Should 93% of the state's voters have no say at all in who wins in November?  Sounds like progressive democracy to me, Kos!]<br /><br />Still, it's hard to feel bad about the actual results of the election.  Sure, Lamont represents a lot of what's worst in American politics.  But so does Lieberman.  There is no Democratic Senator I have more longed to see defeated.  From his nauseating rebuke of Clinton during the impeachment to the fact that his presence on the ticket in 2000 almost certainly cost us that election, to his flirtations with right-wing hostility to the First Amendment, there's nothing to like about Lieberman.  The voters of the party cast out a man who no longer represented their values.  It's good to see a democracy in action, people.  And it's good to be able to say goodbye, tentatively, to Joe Lieberman.<br /><br />But I ain't cheering yet.  Lamont still has to prove himself to a hundred thousand or so people who aren't daily commenters of DailyKos.  People who are far closer to Lieberman than Lamont.  Lieberman stands a very good chance of winning as an independent.  A part of me would love this outcome.  It would allow me to have it both ways.  Democrats standing up and knocking Lieberman down and Lamont and his internet buddies getting their asses handed to them in November.  It will show Democrats that if they nominate men who have no vision beyond a single narrow, and divisive, issue that they cannot win.  It may help us avoid the Cliffs of McGovern.<br /><br />The only dark side to this story is that Lieberman would maintain his seat, from which he will continue to propagate his sinister and revolting notions of censorship and state control of every aspect of our lives.<br /><br />So, all the beyllaching aside, I guess I'm part of Lamontagne.  Go Ned!  Kick Joe in the balls!  Show 'em how a prettyboy prepster does it when the chips are down!
