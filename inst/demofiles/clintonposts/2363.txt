<span>Hillary, what am I going to do with you?</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>First, you impersonate the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) by bitching and moaning about a little sex in a video game. Now, you want us to drift to the Republican Light side of the Democratic Party?</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Are you nuts? That's the same tactic that got us where we are now. Face down with our heads stuck in the sand and our asses in the air!</span>

<span>Clinton Angers Left With Call for Unity</span>
</span>
<br />
<span>Senator Accused of Siding With Centrists</span>
<br />

<br />
<br />
<span>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's call for an ideological cease-fire in the Democratic Party drew an angry reaction yesterday from liberal bloggers and others on the left, who accused her of siding with the centrist Democratic Leadership Council (DLC) in a long-running dispute over the future of the party.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Long a revered figure by many in the party's liberal wing, Clinton (D-N.Y.) unexpectedly found herself under attack after calling Monday for a cease-fire among the party's quarreling factions and for agreeing to assume the leadership of a DLC-sponsored initiative aimed at developing a more positive policy agenda for the party.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The reaction highlighted the dilemma Democratic politicians face trying to satisfy energized activists on the left -- many of whom are hungering for party leaders to advance a more full-throated agenda and more aggressively confront President Bush -- while also cultivating the moderate Democrats and independents whose support is crucial to winning elections. The challenge has become more acute because of the power and importance grass-roots activists, symbolized by groups such as MoveOn.org and liberal bloggers, have assumed since the 2004 election.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The most pointed critique of Clinton came in one of the most influential blogs on the left, Daily Kos out of Berkeley, Calif., which called Clinton's speech "truly disappointing" and said she should not provide cover for an organization that often has instigated conflict within the party.</span>
