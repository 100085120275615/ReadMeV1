<div>Drew and I spent all of last week travelling around Texas and New Mexico.  First we went down to Dallas and stayed with Drew's cousin Hillary.. she is quite awesome!  Then we drove down to Beaumont... now that was a kick in the stomach.  The place is a disaster!  I guess when the hurricane came, everyone with money left and all the people who stayed didn't have enough money to clean up their stuff.  There are big piles of trash everywhere.  After looking at some apartments (which we probably wouldn't beable to rent because nobody seems to have vacancies) we decided to drive as close to the refinery as possible.  My first impression of the place involved some obvious drug dealing and some quick manuevering out of the area in order to avoid getting shot.<br />
<br />The town is just plain dead. All of the shops in the downtown area are vacant, and there was nobody on the streets.  No good.  So I was immediately depressed that I am going to spend 5 months living in this place.  boo.<br />
<br />But then, Drew and I went out to eat with a wonderful girl named Tina (ironically enough) who will be doing the same co-op.  She was super cool and offered to let Curtis and I stay in her parents big beautiful house in the town neighboring Beaumont!!  I literally was jumping for joy when she called about this.  A place to live!  Where I won't get shot!  and I won't have to pay for an extra month that I won't be living there!! (damn 6 month leases) oh and did I mention that their house is beautiful?  yeah... I'm not going to post pictures of it because I'mnot sure if they would approve.  But anyway... I'm still super happy about that!<br />
<br />So then we went down to Houston and spent the day at the Johnson Space Center.  It was pretty cool. We took a trolley out to tour the historic mission control room.<br />

<br />This was where all of the Apollo missions were controlled.  We got to sit in the area that all of the families sat to watch as their astronauts came home.  Pretty cool.<br />
<br />The rest of the place was only decent because it was mainly set up to entertain kids.  I really can't take very many kids running around me at one time.  It'd be really fun to work for NASA.  Maybe someday.<br />
<br />After Houston, we headed out to Galveston Island to camp for the night.  I was suprised at how pretty the beach was.  The water was nice and warm too.  It made for a really nice morning swim.  Then we discovered that we had pitched our tent over a fire ant hill.  whoops...<br />

<br />Next we headed off to good old Austin.  I love this city!  The downtown is alive and growing.. and the city is absolutely beautiful!  It really is like a Lawrence on steroids.  Apparently there is a lot of really good live music out there too.  yay music!<br />
<br />Anyway, this is the hotel that we stayed at in Austin.  It was absolutely beautiful.  The hotel is meant to draw you outside into all of its pretty gardens and courtyards.  Plus it has a really pretty pool.. as all good hotels should.  I give the place an A+!<br />

</a>We spent a couple days in Austin, wandering around the capitol and the UT campus.  Their computer science building is beautiful... oh wait, all computer science buildings are beautiful.  Darn rich computer nerds.<br />
<br />I took Drew out to eat at this really good BBQ place called Ironworks BBQ.  It was by far the best bbq I have ever had.  Ridiculously tasty.  Gah.. just thinking about it is making my mouth water.  yummy!<br />

</a>This is me... satisfied.  (and with crooked glasses)<br />
<br />Then we headed out of Austin to White Sands.<br />
<br />It stormed on us in white sands.  It was probably the most beautiful place I have ever been.. and the rain just made it that much more spectacular.  All of the desert flowers came into bloom.. and its really just plain cool to see rain in the desert.<br />

</a>I woke up bright and early at 3:30am to a nice booming lightning storm coming in from the mountains.  It terrified me for some reason.  I guess I have never really been out in the wilderness with no real protection from the storm (except for the tent.. if that counts).  After I convinced myself that I wasn't going to get struck by lightning, or thrown around by the wind, I began to really enjoy the lightning and rain.  So pretty.<br />
<br />We woke up in the morning and packed up our stuff for the mile and a half hike back to our car.<br />
