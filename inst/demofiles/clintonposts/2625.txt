New York Senator Hillary Clinton gets the Time treatment this week - cover story on her presidential ambitions. </p>

<p>You can't be surprised that they started this courting so early in the process? It seems that everyone has already counted her a winner for re-election in November even though no ballots have been cast. Why not start pondering her future as the Democrat nominee for president in 2008? From the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,1229103,00.html">Time article</a>:</p><blockquote><p><span>Her strategists point out that all she would have to do in November
2008 is win every state John Kerry did, plus one. They consider Ohio
and Florida her best opportunities. And there is plenty of encouraging
news for her in the latest TIME poll. More than half of those
surveyed--53%--said they had a favorable impression of her; she
registered higher than the other most familiar names in the potential
Democratic field, Al Gore (49%), John Edwards (46%) and John Kerry
(45%). Her negative ratings (44%) were lower than either Kerry's or
Gore's. Edwards generated fewer negative reviews (31%), but 23% of
those polled said they didn't know enough about him to have an opinion
one way or the other. In hypothetical matchups with the preseason
G.O.P. favorite, John McCain, Hillary is the only big-name Democrat to
make a real race of it, with McCain edging her by just 2 points among
registered voters. By comparison, McCain would trounce Kerry by 10
points and Gore by 9.</span></p></blockquote><p>The hypothetical polls about 2008 during the 2006 election cycle can't be trusted. These polls are clearly "name recognition" with a little "I like this person/hate this person" thrown in. Right now, no voter is focusing on 2008. </p>

<p>Hillary is a very polarizing political figure. She doesn't have much wiggle room. Republicans and especially conservatives hate her guts. Also, a lot of left-leaners and Democrat blog wingnuts today are trying to threaten Hillary with non-support if she doesn't play ball with them. In the end, these people will be backing Hillary strongly. I don't get too excited about the current "controversy." </p>

<p>She has one negative: she isn't Bill. A lot of people liked President Bill because he always came off as a nice guy, the buddy down at the end of the bar who always had a good story to tell. Hillary doesn't have the same charisma.</p>

<p>But one can never discount her if she runs for president.</p>
