<div><p>So, the Democrats are in Chicago talking over the 2008 primary calendar and the site for the nominating convention.Â  New York City Mayor Bloomberg made a strong case for New York City. The other possible locations are Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota and Denver, CO.Â  Unfortunately, New Orleans is no longer in the running because they are not ready to raise the money required toÂ  host such a large event.Â  New Orleans would have been perfect.Â  In fact, I wish there was some way to help them raise the money.Â  Hurricane Katrina was the turning point in America's relationship with the incompetance of the Bush adminstration and it would have been...well...perfect. <br />
</p>

<p>That being said, I'm dorn between New York City and Denver.Â  On the one hand I would love for Hillary Clinton to get the nomination and it would be oh so sweet to send her off from New York.Â  New York City could also be a nice backdrop to reclaim the national security debate.Â  On the other hand the future of our party could depend on a concerted effort in western states like CO, AZ and NM.Â  <br />
</p>

<p>At the end of the day I believe the symbolism offered via a New York City convention would be most useful.</p>

<p>But, New Orleans would have been perfect!!! :-)</p>
