<p>It feels like I've just crammed a whole summer vacation into one weekend. </p>

<p>Hillary and I graciously helped Ian consume a bottle of wine that desparately needed tasting. <br />
watched <i>The Aviator</i><br />
barbequed with huge group at Locarno for lunch on Canada Day.<br />
played bocce.<br />
sat on the beach.<br />
Ken had a "moment" &#8212; six girls in bikinis synchronized&#8208;swimming around him<br />
went to the jazz festival at David Lam Park. The "jazz" was bad. Bongos + turntable + seizure scat &#8800; "the new fusion". Scat in two senses at once.<br />
walked to Denman and bought food<br />
ate on the beach at English Bay<br />
walked to Stanley Park<br />
Ruth (she gets all the credit) borrowed a flame to build a fire<br />
watched the Ambleside fireworks<br />
church outdoors in Jericho park<br />
Ken and Kadylak and I played tennis. <br />
we're bad (except for Kadylak)<br />
a back yard barbeque<br />
saw the last 10 minutes of the jazz festival at The Roundhouse. The jazz was good<br />
went to The Yaletown Brew for beers<br />
went hiking<br />
went to Ambleside and swam<br />
and, barbequed at a North Van apartment with a view.</p>

<p>And possibly more. I woke up this morning feeling quite exhausted.</p>
