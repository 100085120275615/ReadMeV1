It was a star-studded gala with some of the Democratic Partyâs most prominent luminaries, including Hillary Clinton and John Kerry. What struck me funny about the invitation, in a pathetic kind of way, was that both Clinton and John Kerry were touted as progressives. I had to laugh aloud at this news. But then it dawned on me that the people behind this campaign were serious. Silly me! I chose not to attend, on the excuse that I was donating all of my organs to science this week. </span></div><div align="justify"><span>If I understand the premise of the Take Back America Conference, their agenda is to wrest control of the government from the hands of the Republicans and to place power in the hands of the Democrats. The assumption is, quite erroneous, I think, that America will be a better place under the control of Hillary Clinton and her corporate pay masters than the Bush cowboys and their corporate cow patties. Given that the Democrats only strategy seems to be capitulation, I fail to understand how this is supposed to work. </span></div><div align="justify"><span>The premise of the conference should have been to wrest power from the hands of the capitalists and putting it in the hands of the people where it belongs. But what am I thinking? Plutocrats do not believe in the wisdom or the right of the people to govern themselves or to work for the collective good. These are socialist ideologies that place the welfare of the working people above the greed of the corporations. We will not be having any of that at this conference, or in this country, thank you. </span></div><div align="justify"><span>There were many things wrong with the Take Back America Conference. Like most of the participants, Hillary Clinton was a major supporter of the invasion and occupation of Iraq, as was John Kerry. As is his habit, flip-flop Kerry has since reversed his earlier stance and now speaks out against the criminal war. I am not sure if this should be to Kerryâs credit or not. John Kerryâs original stance as a presidential candidate was to send more troops into harms way and to throw more gasoline onto the fire. Sounds like a good way to get your beard singed to me! On the other hand, Hillary Clinton has never possessed the wisdom, humility, or the character to betray the ruling class to which she belongs. Perhaps all those meetings with the corporate media mogul, Ruppert Murdoch, are taking their toll. </span></div><div align="justify"><span>But no matter; Hillary Clinton and John Kerry, as part of the political mainstream (ruling class) of this country, and both of them Plutocrats, are part of the problem, not the solution. Both of them believe in and support Pax Americana, which is the core of neoconservative thinking that got us into Iraq in the first place. You could count the Democrats who vociferously oppose Pax America on one hand, even if you lost several fingers in a table saw accident.
