<div>Biden just can't seem to keep from stepping it can he? When asked about his chances of winning the Southern states in the 2008 Democratic Primary he said this:<br />
<br />
<em>"Better than anybody else...You don't know my state, My state was a slave state. My state is a border state. My state has the eighth-largest black population in the country. My state is anything from a Northeast liberal state." - </em>

<br />It looks like Democrats are starting to realize that the whole country isn't made up of nothing but Massachusetts and California liberals. And now they're running like crazy tripping over each other to appeal to the "Red States" found mostly in the South (known as fly over country to the Northeast coast democrats).<br />
<br />But here's the problem they have now. They've got the Netroots Mafia threatening to politically assassinate any democrat who doesn't subscribe to their views. I'm actually starting to feel sorry for these guys. They have to choose between trying to get elected by moving to the center and trying to keep from being booted out of their party Lamont style by moving to the left.<br />
<br />This is going to be interesting this fall and in 2008.<br />
