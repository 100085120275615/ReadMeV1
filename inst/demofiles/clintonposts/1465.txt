<blockquote>Sorry, Hillary. And Big John, you might have missed your chance in 2000. That's because a new and innovative poll from John Zogby about 2008 presidential candidates finds former Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich way out front of fellow GOP-ers like Sen. John McCain and also finds moderates like former Virginia Gov. Mark Warner far ahead of libs like Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton.</blockquote>

<p>While not your everyday 2008 poll, <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/whispers/articles/060820/28whisplead_2.htm">Zogby's "blind bios" poll</a> has proven to be very accurate in recognizing momentum in a candidate.  In 1999, the poll was able to "identify Senator John McCain as a very attractive candidate in primary states long before he almost knocked off George W. Bush."  At that time in the election, McCain was a mere blip on the presidential radar screen, normally registering low single digits in polls.</p>

<p>Read on to see extended poll details...</p>
        <p>By excluding the name of the candidate, and instead providing a brief biography and experience, Zogby creatively cancelled out name recognition as a factor in polling, while bringing to the forefront what matters most: a candidate's experience and positions.</p>
