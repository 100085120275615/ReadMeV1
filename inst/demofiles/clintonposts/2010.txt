<span>Heads: The Bush Legacy: #1 With A Bullet!</span>
<br />
</span>
</strong>
<br />Historically, depending on who is doing the research, a few Presidents have been labeled the âworst everâ. The bottom top five are usually Harding, Buchanan, Hoover, Andrew Johnson and Nixon. Even Clinton has been the target of a bottom five contender, but at least when he lied no one died.<br />
<br />In order for our man Bush to make the bottom five, someone has to come out. Iâll pick Hoover. Hoover may have received a bum rap for not reacting strong enough to the economic collapse that has defined his presidency; but thatâs another blog.<br />
<br />Bush, in my opinion, not only breaks the top five, he squarely plants himself in the number one spot in which no President may ever topple. I will give Bush the benefit of the doubt on his actions after 9/11. I quite frankly cannot imagine what any President would or would not have done after the attack. One thing is for certain though, Iraq did not attack us, Bin Laden did. Going after Bin Laden in Afghanistan was the right thing to do, invading Iraq was not.<br />
<br />Not only is Bush the most unpopular President in history who stole an election, he continues to by-pass rule of law, trial by jury, international laws, hacked away at state powers and transferred them to Washington, transferred wealth from middle class to the rich, run national debt up by more than 7 trillion, pandered to the extreme religious right, started an illegal war in Iraq, created a low-wage economy, trampled upon individual rights and continues to deny living persons a better tomorrow. About the only thing he did right was sign the Prescription Drug Plan.<br />
<br />Hey, all this in about six years. Even all the previous bottom five Presidents combined didnât do this much damage to our great country.<br />
<br />George Bushâs legacy will haunt this country for decades and decades to come while our children bear the burden of debt and future body counts in mid-east countries due to gross mismanagement domestically and worldwide.<br />

<span>Tails: The Bush Legacy: Un-conservative</span>
</strong>
<br />
<br />The very name of George W. Bush draws darts of fury from Democrats and the left wing of American politics. They believe that he âstoleâ the election of 2000, and has ever since driven America toward isolationism with the Iraq War policy. He and his cabinet are caricatures of criminals and villains when described by the left. As a conservative, I find that the left should truly love him, and that if anyone should believe that this President has betrayed his country, it should be those on the right. The legacy of President Bush, history will show, will have the readers of history scratching their heads in wonder at why his opponents hated him so much when he governed just as they would have wanted him to.<br />
<br />President Bush has grown government more than any other president in history. He created the Department of Homeland Security. He created more bureaucracy with the addition of the Director of National Intelligence. Not only has the bureaucracy grown, but so has spending.<br />
<br />Not only has spending grown in defense, the one area that conservatives believe that spending should increase, but domestic spending is out of control. <a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/news_detail.asp?newsID=31">According to this report</a> , non-defense spending under President Bush has grown 35.7%, the largest increase in spending since LBJ and his Great Society policies. And President Bushâs policies are the stuff that would make LBJ proud.<br />
<br />President Bush allowed Senator Ted Kennedy basically write his education bill, the âNo Child Left Behindâ act that draws the ire of the NEA and other liberals. He promoted and succeeded in passing through the legislature a prescription drug plan for Medicare while talking out of both sides of his mouth about Social Security reform, which never came to fruition. His insistence on an amnesty clause for illegal aliens already in the U.S. in an immigration reform package is along the lines of Jimmy Carter policy. And, like LBJ, he didnât see a spending bill he did not like.<br />
<br />Conservatives, like myself, took our lumps and held our tongue when much of the above was happening. We voted faithfully for the republicans, helping to insure a majority in the House and Senate, believing that we would soon see a shift from the ever-increasing incremental creep of government and loss of liberty back to the ideals of Jefferson and Madison. I only wish that President Bush had challenged us in the street, as Aaron Burr did Alexander Hamilton, and shot us dead. It would have been a lot less painless than the constant turning of the knife in our back for the last six years.<br />
