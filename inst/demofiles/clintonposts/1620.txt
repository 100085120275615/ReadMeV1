<p>I am so tired of election year bullshit, aren't you? Once again, as November approaches, the Republican-led government is calling for destructive legislation on <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/news/plaindealer/index.ssf?/base/news/1148036275259250.xml&coll=2">gay marriage</a>, <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/living/education/14624656.htm">immigration</a>, <a href="http://www.allamericanpatriots.com/m-news+article+storyid-14836.html">abortion</a>, and <a href="http://www.topix.net/content/cbs/2795319634265126477039413496082705372051">language</a>.  Yes, its time for the 'party of moral values' to break out the summer barbecue and skewer our rights once again.</p>

<p>Frankly, I am tired of election year rhetoric that is full of empty issues, and a three-card-monte approach to what is going on in our country and in the world. We never hear anything on any real issues at hand. Why care about gay marriage when American wages have been stagnant for years. No one should give a shit about a national language measure when American jobs are being bled to India and China at an alarming rate. No one is talking about Iraq, on either side of the aisle. </p>

<p>Here is what I want to hear from viable candidates and a viable party:</p>

<p>1. It's the economy, assholes: The U.S. economy is, and has been stagnant for some time. <a href="http://www.black-collegian.com/news/special-reports/defense2003-2nd.shtml">Defense spending</a> is no way to push up economic indicators in a meaningful way. As the Pentagon spends more and more money on defense measures, the only sector that is experiencing any growth is the defense industry, and that makes for a false sense of economic growth: The government is injecting taxpayer dollars and creating an unnatural growth in this one sector. Reagan did the same thing in the 80s and look what happend at the end of his run. </p>

<p>I want politicians to talk about real measures when discussing the economy. No more of this defense spending reliance. What are you going to do to spur real job growth?</p>

<p>2. Outsourcing: We are bleeding jobs to the third world. Corporations sell us on the worldwide benefits of outsourcing when in reality, all they are doing is serving their investors. So, in order to make more money for a fraction of the populace, businesses sell out American workers at an <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/roberts04192005.html">alarming rate</a> to turn over a short term profit. And by the way, white collar workers, this also means you:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In what might be an underestimate, a University of California study concludes that 14 million white-collar jobs are vulnerable to being outsourced offshore. These are not only call-center operators, customer service and back-office jobs, but also information technology, accounting, architecture, advanced engineering design, news reporting, stock analysis, and medical and legal services. The authors note that these are the jobs of the American Dream, the jobs of upward mobility that generate the bulk of the tax revenues that fund our education, health, infrastructure, and social security systems.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>We are all vulnerable to this trend. So, let's see someone talk honestly about this issue and what they will do to curtail the loss of jobs and even entire industries.</p>

<p>3. <a href="http://www.adn.com/news/environment/warming/story/7744525p-7656597c.html">The environment</a>: Again, a non-sexy issue this year. What real measures are we taking to get to Kyoto? Why are we the biggest polluter in the world and yet we are doing nothing to work on this problem? Mmm could it be that corporations own politicians? I don't want to hear anything more on that stupid ethanol measure. Tell me, tell us about real environmental legislation that will put the responsibility not only on me, as you all usually do, but on the real culprits: Big business. </p>

<p>4. Lobbying: This is the biggest thorn in democracy's side. What the <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Jack_Abramoff">corruption and scandals</a> of this government's lobbying scandals has shown us is that our democracy is in danger of being nullified by the <a href="http://www.democracyctr.org/resources/lobbying.html">bigger corporate voice</a> business has over the average voter. Hillary and the chimp will certainly pay more attention to a corporation that adds to their coffers than they will to me, who only has a few bucks and a vote to offer. I cannot and will not support any politician who is beholden to anybody except for the common voter. Howard Dean's run taught us that voter power goes a long way. I want politicians who reject corporate donations and take money from, and listen to, ordinary Americans. Isn't that what democracy is all about???</p>

<p>5. Iraq: End it and end it now. I cannot and will not support any politician who does not support an immediate withdrawal.</p>

<p>Give me politicians who embody these ideals and who focus on these real issues, and I will get behind them 100%. Till then, I'll be sitting on my porch, watching this country go down the tubes.</p>
