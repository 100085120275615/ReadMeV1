<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Dick, you ignorant slut.<span>  </span></span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Your comments on the floor of the Senate on June 14 are not only appalling, theyâre despicable, dishonest, misleading, disrespectful, and seditious.</span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal"><span>During your tirade regarding the alleged abuse of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba you illustrated some of the treatment you classify as torture.<span>  </span>The transcript of your statements read is below:</span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal"><span>âOn one occasion, the air conditioning had been turned down so far and the temperature was so cold in the room, that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold. ..... On another occasion, the [air conditioner] had been turned off, making the temperature in the unventilated room well over 100 degrees. ...On another occasion, not only was the temperature unbearably hot, but extremely loud rap music was being played in the room, and had been since the day before, with the detainee chained hand and foot in the fetal position on the tile floor.</span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>If I read this to you and did not tell you that it was an FBI agent describing what Americans had done to prisoners in their control, you would most certainly believe this must have been done by Nazis, Soviets in their gulags, or some mad regime--Pol Pot or others--that had no concern for human beings. Sadly, that is not the case. This was the action of Americans in the treatment of their prisoners.</span>â</span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Let me get this straightâ¦<span>  </span><i>Thatâs</i> torture?<span>  </span>Hardly.<span>  </span>I was subjected to worse through hazing when I played rugby in college.<span>  </span></span></p>       <p class="MsoNormal"><span>By comparing our fine men and women in military service to the likes of Nazis, Soviets, and the Khmer Rouge you have given aid and comfort to the enemy.<span>  </span>You have shown disrespect for the sacrifice, service, and selfless duty that those charged with handling the detainees willingly subject themselves as volunteers in the United States military.<span>  </span>Guarding and interrogating evil men that are bent on the wanton murder of Americans for no other reason than they are Americans, is a tough and undesirable job.<span>  </span>Keep in mind that those detained at Guantanamo Bay want <i>you</i>, me, and every other American dead.<span>  </span>They are psychotic, twisted zealots who think they need to destroy us because they disapprove of our values as a nation.<br /></span></p>   <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Just today I read that you blame the âright wingâ media for taking your comments out of context.<span>  </span>That is a pathetic excuse.<span>  </span>You need to take responsibility for your statements.<span>  </span>But then again, individual responsibility is a foreign concept to leftist trash such as yourself.  It's rather obvious that you can't address your political differences with President Bush without acting childishly.  Your level of maturity is miniscule.  You are a moral dwarf.<br /></span></p>     <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Just resign.<span>  </span>Go crawl back into the hole from whence you came.<span>  </span>While youâre at it, take Ted Kennedy, Harry Reid, the twin twits from California, and Hillary with you.</span></p>
