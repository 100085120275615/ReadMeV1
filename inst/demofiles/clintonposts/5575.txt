So the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/health/25fda.html?ei=5088&en=8af548f24191897e&ex=1314158400&adxnnl=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&adxnnlx=1156507821-YlK1MAIeWEpKnV4isXRN7A" target="_blank">FDA has approved the "morning after" pill</a> to be sold over the counter to people over the age of 18:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved over-the-counter sales of the morning-after contraceptive pill to women 18 and older, resolving one of the most contentious issues in the agencyâs 100-year history.<br />
<br />
Nationwide over-the-counter sales of the drug, Plan B, are expected to start by the end of the year. It will be sold in pharmacies and health clinics only, and buyers must show proof of age. Anyone under age 18 will still need a prescription. Men may also buy Plan B for a partner.</blockquote>This doesn't solve any problems, believe me.  Kids will work their way around it as they always have.  They'll simply pay an adult to buy the pills for them, just as they do with booze or cigarettes.  <br />
<br />
"Mister, if I gave you ten bucks, would you go into that pharmacy over there and buy me some abortion pills?"  <br />
<br />
"Sure thing, kid!"<br />
<br />
The major difference I see here, though, is that when an adult buys alcohol or tobacco for minors, they can be arrested, since they're breaking the law.  With this, I don't see anything of the kind.  We're going to "trust" the company to enforce the rules, who will in turn "trust" pharmacists.  Can't you imagine what's going to happen here?<br />
<br />
For those who may think I'm being paranoid about this, see this quote from the article:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Barr will study Plan Bâs use in young adolescents in hopes of getting the agencyâs age restrictions lifted, Mr. Downey said.<br />
<br />
âIn my mind,ââ he said, âif we go back and have an adequate study that includes the younger group, the basis for any age restriction goes away.â</blockquote>So their goal is to sell it to minors, and Democrats who favor abortion on demand, like Hillary Clinton, are right there with them.<br />
<br />
It's not that the pill would harm minors, it's that giving it to them sends the wrong message: that it's perfectly ok to go out and have sex.  There's no penalties, no repercussions for that risky behavior.  If you get pregnant, take this pill.  If that doesn't work, you can have an abortion.  In today's world, with AIDS, STDs, and all kinds of other sexually transmitted diseases, it's a death sentence to allow them to believe that.<br />
<br />
I'm not against contraception by any means, but it should not be given to minors under any circumstances.  They are ill-equipped to deal with that kind of responsibility.  If you're too young to handle having a kid, then you are too young to be using contraceptives, and you're certainly too young to be having sex.  <i>That's</i> the message that needs to be sent to our children, both by the parents and by society as a whole.<br />
<br />
<b>**Update**:</b> And if you think Dems don't play partisan politics with abortion and things like that, <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-ushill0825,0,532625.story?coll=ny-top-headlines" target="_blank">read this article</a>:<br />

<blockquote>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton will stop blocking President George W. Bush's nomination of Andrew von Eschenbach to head the Food and Drug Administration, following the agency's decision yesterday to allow over-the-counter sales of Plan B contraceptive pills.</blockquote>
