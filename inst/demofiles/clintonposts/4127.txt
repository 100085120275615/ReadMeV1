<p>&#8230; why else would the Guardian be so desperate that it has chosen now to publish a <a href="http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1848579,00.html?gusrc=rss&#038;feed=19">story</a> announcing that (gasp!) Tony Benn is critical of the government and (shock!) his son is a member of the cabinet!</p>
<p>In what way is this earth shattering news to anyone (that is anyone outside of the American mid-west and not still getting to grips with the parentage of Bart Simpson)?  It was kind of news when Hillary won his seat in 1999, sort of interesting when he got his first junior minister post, but now?</p>
<p>God help us if they start publishing &#8220;Tony/Lauren Booth thinks the government is a bit shit&#8221; stories again.  They might just as well pack up and go home.
