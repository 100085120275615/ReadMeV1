<br />John Edwards recently came in 1st place in Iowa in a poll of likely Democratic Presidential candidates conducted by the Des Moines Register. For those of you who don't understand what the big deal about Iowa is, it's important because it's where the first caucus takes place. Whoever wins the Iowa caucus not only wins a majority of that state's delegates, but also takes a lot of momentum into the 1st Primary in New Hampshire.<br />
<br />Here are the results of the poll:<br />
<br />John Edwards 30%<br />
<br />Hillary Clinton 24%<br />
<br />John Kerry 12%<br />
<br />Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack 10%<br />
<br />and so on...<br />
<br />All you see on tv is Hillary Clinton this and Hillary Clinton that. Hillary Clinton is the frontrunner and nobody can stop her from winning the nomination. Mark it down right now because I'm predicting it tonight. HILLARY CLINTON WILL NOT WIN THE IOWA CAUCUS!<br />
<br />Kudos to Senator Edwards! May the campaign be a successful one! All I know is I can't wait for 2008!</div>
