	<p>Thanks go out to the inestimable Samuel L. Jackson and sci-fi geek Cory Doctorow for bringing together an image that is quite possibly the most perfect illustration that captures exactly how ludicrous the TSA and British Airways official&#8217;s reaction to the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/10/us.security/index.html">foiled plot to blow up several airplanes is</a>.</p>
	<p>I mean, seriously.  Do they really think that&#8217;s going to accomplish anything?  I mean besides raise the level of fear and anxiety through-out the country just in time for a much-needed poll boost in time for mid-term elections?  Joe Lieberman has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/11/opinion/11fri1.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">already used it as a soundbite to try to justify America&#8217;s failed policy in Iraq</a>, and Cheney is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/08/10/cheney-ct/">pulling out his tried and true argument that voting for democrats is voting for Al-Qaeda</a>.  This whole thing smacks of McCarthyistic scare tactics designed to frighten voters into continuing the legislative dominance of the Bush regime.</p>
	<p>The question remains, will voters swallow that story again?  It&#8217;s been pretty well documented by now that the Bush regime&#8217;s policies have done nothing to improve the security of the nation and have, instead, wrought more devastation and exponentially increased the recruiting base for terrorist groups.  I mean, just one look at Bush Co.&#8217;s scorecard reveals how five years into this so-called &#8220;war on terror,&#8221; which is an even more ridiculous pursuit than our failed &#8220;war on drugs,&#8221; the United States has <b>failed</b> in every one of it&#8217;s goals.</p>
	<p>Afghanistan?  No, sorry, failed state.  With Afghani President Hamid Karzai saying he <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/08/07/news/international/karzai.fortune/">won&#8217;t seek re-election and publicly decrying the corruption within his government</a> and the ousted <a href="http://u.tv/newsroom/indepth.asp?id=75844&#038;pt=n">Taliban government continuing to gather power in the Southern provinces</a>, there seems to be no chance of success for this country that has seen no peace for over 30 years.  Too bad the <a href="http://www.hoffmania.com/blog/2006/08/heres_the_clip.html">United States didn&#8217;t stick around long enough to actually help (awesomely good clip)</a> prop up the new government, and too bad we had to cut aid to the country so we could save up for that other marvel of intelligent decisions- the invasion and occupation of Iraq.</p>
	<p>Ohhh Iraq.  I mean really, what can I say about Iraq that hasn&#8217;t been said a thousand times before, by pundits far more eloquent than I?  Sure, they caught Hussein and he&#8217;s now standing trial, as long as his attorneys manage not to get shot on the way to court.  But the US has essentially replaced one dictator with a thousand little warlords and ignited a conflict that will likely come to an end in the same timely fashion in which the Israeli/Palestinian conflict was ended.  Oh wait, it&#8217;s never going to end.  I forgot.</p>
	<p>Though really, how can you forget that the US&#8217; vocal support for Israel&#8217;s invasion of Lebanon (all in the name of that most holy of holies, National Security) has added legitimacy to what by all definitions is an occupation of a sovereign state in order to root out non-state actors and added fuel to a conflict which now seems likely to draw in the two large supporters of Hezbollah, Syria and Iran.  And there is no denying that if those two giants get pulled into the conflict, the situation is likely to go nuclear as even mighty Israel, with all the backing of the US arms dealers, would be hard-pressed to deter those nations, who are not suffering under a ten year embargo as Iraq was and currently have powerful standing armies.  In other words, the shit hath hitteth the fan.</p>
	<p>But here in the States we are more concerned with Gatorade and water bottles.  We are worried about people bringing iPods and books on airplanes.  We are enforcing triple searches at airports through-out the country.  Because two just weren&#8217;t enough, and there&#8217;s no telling what a potential terrorist might acquire between the time of their second search and enclosure in the passenger holding area and the time that they board their flights.  If anything these draconian measures will only heighten the tension of an already bad situation.  </p>
	<p>Flying is a strain on people, and taking away their water, making them reliant upon the thimble-sized cups that flight attendants pass out and forcing them to listen to the Muzak that is pumped through the armrests of each seat will likely cause far more harm than a potential explosive bottle of Gatorade.  I can see it now, harried flight attendants scurrying down the aisles trying frantically to meet the demands of surly fliers trapped in the middle of a 13 hour flight and watching the latest Hillary Duff film for the third time- that is a ticking time bomb far more dangerous than any potential Al-Qaeda plot.</p>
	<p><b>UPDATE:</b>  <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/posts/2006/08/11/olbermann-exposes-the-politicizing-of-the-explosive-liquids-threat/">Crooks &#038; Liars has posted a clip of Keith Olbermann talking about the politicization of the explosive liquids threat</a> and how none of this is new and had been warned of back in March.  No matter how the fools in office try to spin it, our level of security hasn&#8217;t improved.
