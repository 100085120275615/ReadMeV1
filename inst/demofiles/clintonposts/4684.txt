<p>Oh, how the mighty do plummet.</p>

<p>Ken Lay, you felonious old scamp. Skittering off behind the great mortal curtain right at payback-time. Come back here and eat your big plate of dung right this second.</p>

<p>Lucky, lucky Kenny, indecently dying of a massive coronary like that while still hoarding $43 million in old-lady quarters that he leeched off of Enron. In the meantime, heâs so dead now that all his charges are dropped. </p>

<p>So now I get why Republicans are so concerned with kissing up to their homeboy Jesus, because after making the most of their Last Armegeddon Tango in Corporate America, they really require a duty-free afterlife.  It all makes sense. </p>

<p>Layâs lawyers are now faced with the prospect of suing his estate to get their money.  One can only presume this has come to the attention of fellow artery-sucking Texan and Former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling, who has already paid his lawyers $40m, and still owes âmultiple tens of millions of dollarsâ to his legal repsâ¦.Skilling, according to The WEEK, âis now asking the government to release $60m in personal assets that were frozen when he was indicted in 2004.â  </p>

<p>Ha ha ha, fellas, give Daddy back the money, now. Thatâs Daddyâs personal money. </p>

<p>No more vodka-urinating ice-sculptures of Belgian infants at the big Texas bar-mitzvahs. <br />
It was a good deal while it lasted.  Lay, Lay, DeLay.  Goodnight evahbody. </p>

<p>Speaking of overrated virtues, Hillary Duff, Hollywoodâs oldest virgin at 18, intends to keep her hymen intact until she is married, according to the WEEK.  This is apparently because she is the Anti-Lohan, and therefore must ideologically protect all tweens from That Devil Intercourse. Note Duffâs demure, cable-knit, non-Lindsay poncho. Note her apparent disinterest in anorexia, and hence expanding Duff. Duffâs ex-boyfriends will surely not be discussing her pubic hair on video whilst Paris Hilton snickers in the background. </p>

<p>Duff, it seems, is not as idiotic as she sounds. The enormous demographic of âSRTâs,â or âSilver Ring Teensâ who have taken chastity vows, are apparently more concerned with whether or not their recording artists are chaste and/or virgins than they are concerned with their actual musicâ¦. which explains some of the deeper mysteries of recent popular culture.  </p>

<p>Jessica Simpson, e.g., was a publicly abstinent âvirginâ before her telemarriage. </p>

<p>"I promised God, my father and my future husband that I would remain a virgin until I got married,â she said, way back then.</p>

<p>I only regret that MTV didnât bother to show us the bloody sheet after her wedding night.</p>

<p>Britney Spears was a virgin, way, way back in 2000, and the bloody sheets are still being displayed in the tabloids. Actually, they are the tabloids. </p>

<p>According to a fairly old article by Russell D'Arby, on the Swift Report, the chastity factor was allegedly responsible for record producers âpressuring Britney to marry.â</p>

<p>"You saw her popularity really beginning to slide as her young teen fans perceived that she was 'giving it up for freeââ¦The Jive (Records) executives have seen the writing on the wall: virginity sells. So they married her off as quickly as they could,"  some âinsiderâ told DâArby. </p>

<p>I remember when Brooke Shields trumpeted her virginity on record, back in the stone age, but it was more interesting then, because it was a cognitively dissonant counterpoint to her posing as a topless hooker at age 12, in a film directed by accused statutory rapist Roman Polanski. </p>

<p>Wait, is it really so different?  </p>

<p>âReclaimed virginityâ apparently also works wonders for healing the sexual disgrace of teen idols like Xtina Aguileraâ¦but, really, Xtian charity notwithstanding: would you buy a used virginity from Britney Federline? </p>

<p>Would you buy a Christian redemption from Jeff Skilling? Hmmmm. </p>

<p>Speaking of boycotts, TIME sez Jay-Z is also fighting the good fight: he is making his nightclubs boycott Cristal after the expensive champagne company described its popularity among hip-hop stars as a âcuriosity.â</p>

<p>Jay-Z resents his tastes and his peeps being referred to as a âcuriosity.â This angered and offended Mr. Z. Cristal sales are now expected to fall dramatically, unto the plight of <br />
Zima Clearmalt or the particularly detested Seagramâs Peach Gin-n-Juice.</p>

<p>And finally, speaking of product death, we bid a fond Dreg-u-sational farewell to Tylenol, the non-aspirin pain reliever weâve all been taking for our hangovers for yearsâ¦.which now has been proven to be way worse for your liver than all those Pucker Sour Apple shooters.</p>

<p>Itâs a cruel world, fiends.  Repent. <br />
