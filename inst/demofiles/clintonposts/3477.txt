<div>Partamian Here... time to rant a bit.<br />
<br />Quit driving so much!  Actually, quit bitching about gas prices... I don't care if you don't want to pay $3.00 a gallon.  Stop blaming "big" business for our lack of discipline and planning.  Speaking of "Big"... When was the last time anyone heard the word "tobacco" not preceded by the word "big"?  What's next?<br />
<br />I'm predicting that we will all hear the following statement (or something similar) very soon.<br />
<br />"The government has got to do something about Big High Fructose Corn Syrup."<br />
<br />We will of course need an investigation by a congressional or presidential commission on the role of B. H. F. C. S. in our national epidemic/pandemic of obesity.<br />
<br />Stop driving so much... walk more... have an apple.  Quit complaining.<br />
<br />Oh... and another thing.  I blame Big Trees for my sniffling and sneezing.  They are conspiring to put out extremely high levels of pollen in the Spring.  Other plants use insects to spread pollen.  But oh no... that's not good enough for Big Trees!  There needs to be an investigation into this pollen problem.  If Kerry or Hillary were president, I bet that there would be less pollen in the air.  I bet Dick Cheney has some sort of big business connection to Big Trees.  Maybe he has some sort of lumber company stock.  I bet that's true.  In fact, now that I have written it... it is true.  Cheney  is profiting from Big Trees indiscriminate use of airborne pollen and I am a victim of Dick Cheney's greed.  The Vice President of the United States is making me sneeze.</div>
