<p>As many of you have already seen, the result&#8217;s of Pactrick Ruffini&#8217;s <a href="http://www.patrickruffini.com/archives/2005/08/the_big_one_res.php">&#8216;08 Presidential Straw Poll</a> are now available and offer plenty to think about. But while DJ Drummond, from polipundit.com (my favorite blog), writes a very good <a href="http://polipundit.com/index.php?p=9699">article</a> on why this straw poll isn&#8217;t as accurate as Ruffini would have you beleive, I&#8217;m going to take it as being pretty accurate  just for the sake of arguement. </p>
	<p>Of the candidates that are likely to run,  Rudy Guiliani, former mayor of New York, received strong plurality of the votes with 30.0%, George Allen, senator from Virginia, received 20.2%, and Newt Gengrich, former Speaker of the House, recieved 14.3%. I find this very interesting mainly for that fact that the main base of this vote would seem to be conservatives who frequent the right blogosphere because of the way it is advertised through these blogs. I would not expect many liberals to have voted in this poll. Because of this, I was surprised when I saw that Guiliani was not only doing well, but held a commanding lead in the poll. I have always seen Guiliani as a somewhat electable candidate nationally, but I had always hoped that the Republicans would not be stupid enough to nominate him. Mainly, because of his liberal views on abortion and gay rights. It would seem to me that the Republicans would be begging for a socially conservative third party candidate to run and take 5-10% of the vote away from Guiliani. Even if this would not happen I do not see many conservative Republicans going out to vote for a man who does not support the issues that they hold to be most important. I, myself, would have a hard time driving down to my local courthouse to cast a vote for him and would only do so if I thought that it could make a difference between him and a liberal, anti-war democrat winning. I believe it would be political suicide for the party to nominate such a candidate and it would threaten to split the party right down the middle.</p>
	<p>However, I am still happy to see that George Allen is polling at an electable level. Of all of the candidates that are likely to run, he is, by far, my favorite. He is a conservative Senator that has executive experience from when he served as Governor of Virginia. He doesn&#8217;t quite have the personality that I would like to have in a Presidential candidate but I believe that is something that could be overcome. </p>
	<p>If I could nominate anyone, however, it would, without a doubt, be Dick Cheney. I can think of no better President. However, I realize that for health and other reasons, he would not be a good candidate and I think it would be best if he would stick with his word and not run. After him, I think my choice would have to be Jeb Bush who i think could be a lot better of a candidate then his brother because of his age, ethnic family, battleground state, and other reasons. But I realize that, mainly because of his last name, he is not a viable candidate. Maybe it&#8217;s a &#8220;Bush by any other name&#8230;.&#8221; kind of thing.</p>
	<p>With 38 months to go before the general election, I realize that there is plenty of time for the Republicans will work this out and will not nominate a candidate that would alienate part of their base. I believe that, especially if the Democrats nominate Sen. Clinton, the Republicans have a great shot retaining the White House in &#8216;08 but their is a lot that can happen between now and then.
