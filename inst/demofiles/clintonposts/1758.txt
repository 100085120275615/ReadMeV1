</a> Hillary Reports Celebrity Photog Annie Liebowitz' Contribution of Professional Services at FMV as Required by FEC Regs, But Hides Services Contributed through Peter Paul by Cher, Diana Ross, Patti LaBelle, Tony Braxton, Melissa Ethridge, Michael Bolton and Sugar Ray.<br />Hillary Clinton's campaign knew how to comply with Federal Election Regulations as shown by Hillary's report of professional services, valued at $2000 for each photograph taken by her friend and celebrity photographer Annie Liebovitz, of each $25,000 contributor to Hillary's campaign.<br />
<br />As required by FEC regulations, when professional services are contributed to help a federal candidate raise funds, those services must be reported as an "in kind" contribution by the service provider or producer, based on the fair market value of those services.  However, when it came to the fair market value of the professional services that Peter Paul had eight international singing stars contribute to help Hillary raise hard dollar contributions through the Gala concert, no similar report was made!<br />
<br />Hillary witnessed the services being provided by Cher, Diana Ross, Patti La Belle, Tony Braxton, Melissa Ethridge, Michael Bolton, Sugar Ray and Paul Anka, and yet she did not have ANY of their service contributions reported as she did with Annie Liebovitz. This amounted to an additional $1 million in in kind contributions being hidden by Hillary's campaign.</div>
