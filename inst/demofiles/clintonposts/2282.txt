<p>Things are quiet here in Texas Congressional District 22. Well, there are rumblings about some out of state Georgia congressman urging TX-22 voters to vote for Bob Smither. See about it <a href="http://www.brazosriver.com/index.html#August_22">here</a>. But I am absolutely brain-dead today, so I am not going to participate in the observations underway on the GOP  grilling of Bob Barr, or the speculation about whether the 3 million promised by the GOP head office will actually find it's way to the Pink Lady's campaign warchest. I am, however,  mildly amused by an email I received today.</p>
<p>My auntie out west is the widow of a union man, and long-time Democrat. She reads my blog from time to time, so I bet she'll be surprised to see that I have posted her forwarded email to my blog today. I am a lover of irony and these one liners ooze irony. Enjoy.</p>

<u>Things you have to believe to be a Republican today:</u>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton. </li>
<li>Trade with Cuba is wrong because that country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.<br />
</li>
<li>The United States should get out of the United Nations, but our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.<br />
</li>
<li>A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations should be able to make decisions affecting all mankind without any regulation.<br />
</li>
<li>The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches, while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.<br />
</li>
<li>If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.<br />
</li>
<li>A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.<br />
</li>
<li>Providing health care to all Iraqis is a sound policy, but providing health care to all Americans is socialism.<br />
</li>
<li>HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart, as do oil companies.<br />
</li>
<li>Global warming is junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.<br />
</li>
<li>A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense, but a president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.<br />
</li>
<li>Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.<br />
</li>
<li>The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.<br />
</li>
<li>Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.<br />
</li>
<li>What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant. </li>
</ul>
