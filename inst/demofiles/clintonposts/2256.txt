<p class="mobile-post">This was the first year that I have gotten to see the entire parade. I took the day off from work and hung out with a few friends on 8th St. in the West Village. The parade was rather long (about 5 hours) and kind of boring at some points, but it as a whole, the parade was great!</p>
<p class="mobile-post">The parade opened with Hillary Clinton again. I always get excited when I see her. I didn't get a good picture of her this year because she was surrounded by too many people. Oh well. I did see her waving and smiling which wasgood enough for me. The crowd always goes crazy when they see her. *sigh* Hillary is amazing.</p>
<p class="mobile-post">Anyway, the parade was full of floats, rainbows, drag queens and of course... hot, practically naked men. I thought that the man pictured above was the hottest guy in the entire parade. He is totally my type. </p>
<p class="mobile-post">So, the parade was fun, but now I must go and enjoy some of the parties. Maybe I'll meet the hottie above (I'd be happy to strap one on for him if that is what he likes). Ok. I'm out!</p>
