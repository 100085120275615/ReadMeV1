<p>It&#8217;s the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, which has been covered in achingly emotional detail by <a href="http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/whentheleveesbroke/index.html" target="_blank">Spike Lee</a> and <a href="http://www.c-span.org/homepage.asp?Cat=Current_Event&#038;Code=HUR&#038;ShowVidNum=17&#038;Rot_Cat_CD=HUR&#038;Rot_HT=&#038;Rot_WD=&#038;ShowVidDays=365&#038;ShowVidDesc=&#038;ArchiveDays=365" target="_blank">The Span</a> (forget CNN and MSNBC&#8217;s professional pundits - HBO and Cspan are giving us the real story from the victims and the people in the trenches).</p>
	<p>It&#8217;s also the 10th anniversary of the <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3734.ENR:htm" target="_blank">Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act</a> a.k.a welfare reform.</p>
	<p>Ten years ago, in a strategic display of bipartisanship, President Bill Clinton worked with a Republican Congress to overhaul our welfare system. Progressives everywhere were alarmed at the prospect of welfare recipients without a safety net. Here it is, however, ten years on and the results have been reported as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/washington/21welfare.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin" target="_blank">&#8220;one of the most successful policy changes in our nation&#8217;s history&#8221; </a>reducing both federal spending and welfare caseloads.</p>
	<p>As always, we need to take a deeper and more serious look at this Conservative &#8220;I-told-you-so&#8221; moment. It is true that welfare roles and federal spending have been reduced and that <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/08/23/from_welfare_to_poverty.php" target="_blank">more poor women are working now</a> then were working 10 years ago. It&#8217;s also true, however, that the minimum wage jobs employing the majority of the &#8220;Welfare-to-Work&#8221; recipients cannot <a href="http://www.barbaraehrenreich.com/nickelanddimed.htm" target="_blank">support one person</a> let alone a family of 2, 3, or 4. The requirement for those with children to support and without a High School diploma or work skills to &#8220;get to work or else&#8221; is a trap. In other words, work this low-wage job without any chance for advancement that eats into the time you need to invest in a GED or advanced job skills training, or else.</p>
	<p>Then there are also those that are truly incapable of working 9 to 5 due to a physical or mental illness. They need a more nuanced system, not the inflexible federally-mandated welfare policies currently in place. </p>
	<p>Other issues that still need to be addressed by Congress include the minimum wage, reliable child-care, and health-insurance benefits, all of which negatively affect the valiant working-poor struggling to take care of their families.</p>
	<p>Rachel Gragg and Margy Waller, who served as advisors on welfare policy to Senator Paul Wellstone and President Bill Clinton respectively, <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/08/22/welfare_reform_10_years_later/" target="_blank">offer up a &#8220;what&#8217;s next?&#8221; moment</a> pointing out that federal policymakers should &#8220;stop basking in their own &#8217;success&#8217; and instead catch up to state and local officials who have been focusing on &#8220;turning low-wage jobs into better jobs with higher wages and employment benefits.&#8221;</p>
	<p>It might be a good time, Mr. President, to have a welfare policy advisor in the White House once again as it&#8217;s painfully clear that welfare reform is an important work in progress.<br />
