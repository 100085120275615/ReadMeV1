<p>I really wish that 'None of the Above' had been a choice on the poll.   'It's My Turn Next' gave us Bob Dole as a candidate, and we all know how that one turned out.</p>
<p>But going down the list, Newt I could pretty happily vote for, but I don't think he can win. Allen hasn't done anything to disqualify getting my vote yet.   Frist would be a 'lesser of evils' choice, but he's been spectacularly unimpressive in the senate leadership.   Rudy I'd vote for over most Democrats, but the 2nd amendment thing worries me.</p>
<p>Romney I'd vote for, but his insistence on pushing Hillary-Care through in Massachusetts worries me.   And McCain won't get my vote regardless of the opponent. </p>
<p>So yeah, a pretty unimpressive bunch.  Everyone but McCain I'd most likely hold my nose and vote for.  </p>
