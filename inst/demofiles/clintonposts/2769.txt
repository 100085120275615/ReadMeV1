<div><p>Oh yeah - I almost forgot to say - I read Hillary Carlip's "Queen of the Oddballs" and liked it. In fact I recommend it ... extremely amusing... memoir of 70s, 80s, a bit of 90s and a riot grrl awakening. Crucial lesbian history!   8-)   Good for fangirls to read.</p>

<p>I used to have a bunch of copies of "Girlpower" which I bought at some half-price books type of place for very cheap. Now I only have one. That book should be the first of many like it. At this point, it should just be an enormous group blog.  </p>

<p>Note to self to send Carlip my poem about Lisa and Wendy and Apollonia. </p></div>
