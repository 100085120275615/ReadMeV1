<p>1.  DRTEDâS 2006 ELECTION PROJECTIONS, AUGUST</p>

<p>DrTedâs projections are based upon information gathered during the previous week from a variety of internet and personal sources; hence, they are a week late.  I will update these projections in early September.</p>

<p>Jefferson County Races: KY Supreme Court I had Judge Anne O'Malley beating Judge William McAnulty in the Spring. No reason to change it now.  I believe that a strong Catholic and womenâs vote will propel Judge Shake to victory.  For the record, I am voting for Judge Shake because I believe that she is the best person for the job.</p>

<p>Mayor Jerry wins with approximately 62% of the vote.  Kelly Downard has continuously sabotaged his campaign. Mr. Downard should have voted against the Mayorâs budget.  Mr. Downard then comes out with a spend and spend series of pledges.  No, no, no!</p>

<p>Tony Lindauer beats John May for PVA by 10 or more points. Tony has a solid base in the Highlands and ran an excellent primary campaign.  John May gets hurt by being a Fletcher appointee.  </p>

<p>David Nicholson narrowly beats (about five points) Shelley Knopf for Clerk of the Jefferson County Circuit Court.  This will be the race to watch in Jefferson County.  This is a long-time Democratic seat, which might hurt Nicholson. Also the Repubs will target this seat.  Nicholson rides the anti-Republican wave to victory.</p>

<p>Bobbie Holsclaw beats Paul Shaughnessy for Jefferson County Clerk.  Holsclaw is able to overcome the Democratic wave. Her victory is relatively close âten points or less.   </p>

<p>Democrats gain one in the Metro Council. The Democratic  incumbents, including Vickie Aubrey Welch,  hold their seats in the Metro Council. Neville Blakemore upsets Fleming. </p>

<p>Kentucky General Assembly Races: Democrats gain two seats in the State Senate. New total is Repubs 20 and Dems 18.  Firkins beats Stephenson relatively easily; Shir makes it a close race against Deweese. </p>

<p>U.S. House Predictions: Democrats gain 13, including one independent seat. Republicans lose 12, New totals will be Repubs 220 and Dems 215. Kentucky will be plus one for Democrats, with Lucas winning. Baron Hill will win.</p>

<p>U.S. Senate Predictions:  Dems gain 4. New total is 50 Repubs, 49 Dems and 1 independent; with the one independent being the socialist Bernie Sanders. He will be in the Democratic caucus. New total is thus 50-50.  <br />

<p>3.  THE U.S. SENATE RACE IN RHODE ISLAND: WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT <br />
    from the Crystal Ball (Professor Larry Sabato of U.VA)</p>

<p>(The Senate race in Rhode Island will, I believe, determine which party controls the U.S. Senate. Here is the call of that race by Professor Sabato.)</p>

<p>Again, the Crystal Ball(Professor Larry Sabato of the U of VA) is very tempted to change this rating to Leans Democratic. We will resist the impulse until after the Republican primary(on September 12th); if Senator Lincoln Chafee can defeat Cranston Mayor Steve Laffey by a wide margin, then perhaps he can regain some momentum and secure a new term. But, it will take something substantial back into a commanding position in this race. Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse is in a good position to score an upset. It is just too early to say whether that upset will occur. </p>

<p>4.   FROM THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S SENATE CONFERENCE PLAYBOOK: <br />
     SECURING AMERICA'S FUTURE from anon</p>

<p>Dear Colleagues: </p>

<p>During the August recess period, we have the opportunity to highlight our accomplishments in the Senate and our continued dedication to Securing America's Future. Senate Republicans remain committed to securing Americaâs homeland, prosperity, and values. </p>

<p>We are dedicated to defending America and securing the homeland by completing the mission in Iraq, hunting down terrorists around the world, and securing our borders and ports. With the passage of the Defense Authorization bill, the Homeland Security Appropriations bill, and the Reauthorization of the Patriot Act, Senate Republicans have demonstrated their ongoing commitment to fighting to protect our nation. We have also increased significantly resources to protect our borders. </p>

<p>Senate Republicans also remain committed to Securing America's Prosperity. Republican pro-growth tax relief policies have fueled 3 years of job creation and nearly 5 years of overall economic growth. More Americans are working today than ever before, wages continue to rise, and federal tax revenues are surging, producing faster- <br />
than-expected deficit reduction progress. While the economy is making significant progress, we can still do more to help American families. </p>

<p>To sustain our strong economic growth and to help the American people with the cost of living, we will remain committed to lowering gas prices and securing America's energy independence through increasing American energy supplies and sources; supporting America's small businesses; securing affordable and accessible health care for all Americans; and keeping money in the pockets of American families by extending tax cuts and limiting spending. We are committed to securing America's competitiveness and creating new jobs through continued economic growth. </p>

<p>Our nation shares values that have defined the American character, helped those in need, protected our families, and shaped our society. As Republicans, we are committed to securing and upholding these values by supporting parents, keeping our children safe, and promoting healthy communities. </p>

<p>Please continue to communicate the vision and accomplishments of our Conference by supporting our positive agenda to Secure America's Future. </p>

<p>Thank you. Rick Santorum Kay Bailey Hutchison Chairman Vice-Chair<br />

<p>6.  ZOGBY POLL: MOST AMERICANS DISPLEASED WITH OVERALL U.S. <br />
    DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS</p>

<p>With two wars raging in the Middle East and the status of a third conflictâthe on-again, off-again fight between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanonâso unstable as to defy a predictable course, and with other global hotspots from North Korea to Venezuela stealing headlines, Americans are pessimistic about how their leaders are conducting diplomacy around the globe, a new Zogby Interactive survey shows.</p>

<p>Just 34% give the Bush administration positive marks for its diplomacy, while 64% give it negative marks. The nationwide interactive survey, conducted July 25-26âbefore this weekend's cease fire between Israel and Hezbollahâincluded 1,734 respondents and carries a margin of error of +/- 2.4 percentage points. Details of the survey are included in the current issue of Zogbyâs Real America newsletter, available now at www.zogby.com.</p>

<p>The split between Democrats and Republicans is remarkable on the question. Among Democrats, 97% give the nation negative marks, while 71% of Republicans give the U.S. positive marks for its interactions with other nations.</p>

<p>The older the respondent, the more likely they were to think the U.S. is doing a good job with diplomacy. Among those aged 18-29, just 24% gave their leaders positive marks for diplomacy, while 53% of those age 65 or older said the U.S. was doing a good diplomatic job.</p>

<p>Because the current major conflicts in the world involve militarized groups, not recognized countries, the Bush administration finds itself dealing with a new wrinkle in international relations. As a result, traditional thinking about diplomacy is stretched. </p>

<p>Asked if the U.S. should open up negotiations with such groups as al Qaeda, Hamas, or Hezbollah, 30% said it should, while 60% said America should not enter into diplomatic relations with such groups.</p>

<p>Thinking of the long term, Americans said they believe that, on balance, the U.S. involvement with the United Nations has been good for the country. Slightly more than halfâ52%âsaid they think membership in the U.N. has been a positive for the U.S., while 37% said they think it has been a negative experience.</p>

<p>Asked whether America should abandon the U.N. and pursue direct diplomatic relations with other nations around the world to solve problems, a majority said "no." </p>

<p>7.  A MUST READ ARTICLE: WASHINGTONâS INTERESTS IN ISRAELâS WAR by <br />

<p>http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/060821fa_fact<br />
(According to Mr. Hersh, the Bush administration is contemplating an attack on Iran between the mid-term election and 08.)</p>

<p>WATCHING LEBANON<br />
Washingtonâs interests in Israelâs war.<br />
by SEYMOUR M. HERSH<br />
Issue of 2006-08-21<br />
Posted 2006-08-14</p>

<p>In the days after Hezbollah crossed from Lebanon into Israel, on July 12th, to kidnap two soldiers, triggering an Israeli air attack on Lebanon and a full-scale war, the Bush Administration seemed strangely passive. âItâs a moment of clarification,â President George W. Bush said at the G-8 summit, in St. Petersburg, on July 16th. âItâs now become clear why we donât have peace in the Middle East.â He described the relationship between Hezbollah and its supporters in Iran and Syria as one of the âroot causes of instability,â and subsequently said that it was up to those countries to end the crisis. Two days later, despite calls from several governments for the United States to take the lead in negotiations to end the fighting, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that a ceasefire should be put off until âthe conditions are conducive.â</p>

<p>The Bush Administration, however, was closely involved in the planning of Israelâs retaliatory attacks. President Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney were convinced, current and former intelligence and diplomatic officials told me, that a successful Israeli Air Force bombing campaign against Hezbollahâs heavily fortified underground-missile and command-and-control complexes in Lebanon could ease Israelâs security concerns and also serve as a prelude to a potential American preemptive attack to destroy Iranâs nuclear installations, some of which are also buried deep underground.<br />

<p>8.  KING GEORGE II FALSELY CONDEMNS ISLAM by Richard F. Dawahare </p>

<p> <br />
Before I eat another bite or take another breath I must confront a dastardly lie, one in the making for many years and repeated for nefarious reasons either explicitly, or implicitly, as today when President Bush said in reference to a foiled London bomb conspiracy: ââ¦ this nation is at war with Islamic fascists who will use any means to destroy those of us who love freedom, to hurt our nation.â</p>

<p>Lie! Damned lie! Bush has yet again condemned the Islamic religion and all its adherents by this sweeping accusation, as inaccurate as it is inappropriate. Whether this is part of a larger plot to fuel the flames of discord by stirring fear and hatred amongst the non-Muslim Americans or not, it most certainly is part of his (their) process in keeping power and waging war, as they have since even before 9/11.</p>

<p>The truth is that yes, there are some people who want to commit heinous crimes against other people. In this case the alleged attackers were Pakistani British residents who were targeting passengers destined for America. Of course, those passengers would have included Muslim as well as Christian, Pakistani as well as American, as all such flights have people of every stripe on board.</p>

<p>Their motives? Who knows, American involvement in their native countryâs affairs? Avenging western attacks on their family and/or countrymen? One thing it is certainly not, however, is a larger Muslim conspiracy to take over the world. This self-fulfilling prophecy has long been enshrined in the concept of the âClash of Civilizations,â first espoused by Samuel Huntington in 1993. It is true that the effect of conflicts between the west and the east are in that sense a conflict between two differing cultures, but that is not the reason for that clash per se.<br />
Those reasons are as old as humanity itself: the quest for resources. The root cause of what Bush calls âIslamic fascismâ is not religious or cultural. Rather it is the westâs incursions into the lands of those peoples, often in a way that is dis-respectful, immoral and certainly in a way that we would never tolerate, thus violating the very heart of Christian ethicsâdo not unto others as you would want done to yourselves.</p>

<p>Islam is one of the three Abrahamic religions along with Judaism and Christianity. It has always been tolerant of these other religions, as the Koran teaches. In fact the Jews flourished under Muslim rule in Spain during the nearly 8 centuries of Moorish rule from 711 to 1492.<br />
You will find no greater praise for Jesus than in the Koran. In fact it esteems Jesus as the Messiah, the Word of God, Godâs most enlightened and sinless prophet. For example:</p>

<p>â¢ in Oud Emrom 5-45, Jesus is referred to as, "the greatest above all in this world and the world to come."</p>

<p>â¢ S-5-46: "And, in their footsteps, we sent Isa (Jesus), the son of Marium (Mary), confirming the law that had come before him. We sent him the gospel. Therein was guidance and light, and confirmation of the law that had come before him. A guidance and an admonition to those who fear Allah (God)."</p>

<p><br />
â¢ 3.45: When the angels said: O Marium, surely Allah gives you good news with a Word from Him (of one) whose name is the '. Messiah, Isa son of Marium, worthy of regard in this world and the hereafter and of those who are made near (to Allah).</p>

<p>There is simply no conflict with Islam and those of other faiths or no faiths. There is no Muslim conspiracy for world domination, certainly no more than, say, a Christian one. The heinous acts of those who see themselves as victims or fighting for victims of western aggression do so in response to perceived injustices against them.</p>

<p>As we do more justice--ending wars and dominations of their lands, providing justice and statehood for Palestinians chief among themâthey do less mayhem.</p>

<p>Remove the thorn to calm the lion.</p>

<p>16.  LAWREADER LEGAL ANALYSIS:  THE MELCHER âOFFICIAL ACT IMMUNITY <br />
     DOCTRINEâ RULING courtesy of Steve Horner   </p>

<p>Where does it take us?</p>

<p> <br />
By Stan Billingsley, Senior Editor LawReader.com</p>

<p> <br />
Special Franklin District Court Judge David Melcher ruled orally from the bench on Friday Aug. 11th. that the Governor could not be prosecuted for alleged criminal acts which formed the basis of an indictment by the Franklin County Grand Jury, until he was impeached or until he left office.  The ruling stayed the prosecution until that time.</p>

<p>We have the greatest respect for Judge Melcher. He is a hard working and respected Judge.  We do however, respectfully dissent from his legal conclusions in this important case.  This case applies not only to this governor, but to all constitutional officers, currently in office and those to come in the future if this doctrine is not contested by an appeal.  </p>

<p><br />
The Doctrine of official or Executive Immunity has had a history of great press but minor successes in the courts.  The extension of this doctrine to serve as a defense against criminal prosecution has in the entire history of the United States found no greater authority than the ruling of Judge Melcher in the Franklin District Court.</p>

<p> <br />
Judge Melcherâs creation of a new legal doctrine which immunizes constitutional officers from criminal prosecution while in office, flies in the face of the basic philosophy on which this country was founded, that no man is above the law, not even the chief executive.</p>

<p>Thomas Paine, Common Sense 57 (Philadelphia 1776).</p>

<p> â...in America THE LAW IS KING. For as in absolute governments the King is Law, so in free Countries the law ought to be King; and there ought to be no other.  Thomas Paine, Common Sense 57 (Philadelphia 1776).</p>

<p> <br />
There is no Kentucky court ruling or statutory enactment that provides support for Judge Melcherâs ruling. On the contrary there are examples of laws which provide for the prosecution of government officials. We suggest that Judge Melcher has confused civil immunity with criminal immunity.</p>

<p> <br />
There is a long line of state and federal authorities which uphold executive, legislative and judicial immunity for official civil acts of the officer.  This immunity extends however only to immunity from civil lawsuits against the officer. Even then the doctrine is not a complete immunity, and the case law spells out many exceptions to the general theory of civil immunity. </p>

<p>In 2002, two bright young Supreme Court law clerks wrote a very credible discussion of the current state of the law in Kentucky regarding immunity of public officials.  In their discussion, which they graciously allowed us to publish at www.lawreader.com, they discuss the landmark case in this area of the law, Yanero v. Davis, 65 S.W. 3d 510 (Ky. 11/21/2001)  </p>

<p>RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY </p>

<p>By Hays Lawson & Adam Shadburne</p>

<p>A. Official Immunity</p>

<p>When successfully invoked, official immunity is absolute immunity. But Yanero holds that the invocation of official immunity depends on both the position an individual holds and the function performed upon which a claim against the individual is based. For example, those entitled to official immunity include: legislators in the performance of their legislative functions, judges for all their judicial acts, and prosecutors with respect to the initiation and pursuit of prosecutions.[18] Yanero stresses that official immunity is afforded to public officials and employees only when there are strong public policy reasons to protect the office itself.[19] Its purpose is not to protect the public official or employee, but rather the office held.[20] the burden is on the defendant to show that he or she is entitled to absolute immunity.[25]</p>

<p>The official immunity discussion in Yanero serves to emphasize that official immunity is the exception when a public official is sued in his or her individual (capacity) ...â</p>

<p>Judge Melcher mentioned the term âofficial actâ in his oral ruling.  That term is frequently used in the discussion of immunity from civil lawsuits by legislative, judicial and executive officers.  This is also known as the doctrine of Sovereign Immunity. Again we must point out that there is no Kentucky case ruling that says this doctrine of civil immunity extends to criminal prosecutions.  The discussion by Lawson and Shadburne we believe correctly demonstrates that âimmunityâof public officials is almost case by case situation.  They demonstrate the history of the law which knocks down any assumption that âimmunityâ is absolute...except for the state itself, and is almost never absolute, as to the person holding the office, for his personal acts or acts outside of his legal authority.</p>

<p> <br />
In the reading of the law, one is required to cite authorities for their decisions.  The personal opinions of a particular judge is rarely considered, unless it is backed up with footnotes or citations of other cases which justify the authorâs conclusion.  In determining the merit of a legal decision one would first look for rulings of the Kentucky court or the Kentucky legislature.  Next one would look at rulings of the U. S. Supreme Court and the Federal Courts.  Next one would look for rulings of other states, then other countries, and at some point along the way one would look for learned treatises of legal scholars.</p>

<p>When applying these standards to the Melcher ruling, we find no Kentucky case, no Kentucky statute, no Federal case, no case of a sister jurisdiction and no learned legal treatise that reaches the conclusion that a governor is immune from criminal prosecution while in office.</p>

<p> <br />
In United States v. Brewster, 408 U.S. 501, 92 S.Ct. 2531 (1971) the U.S. Supreme Court demonstrated that an official act could be criminal and prosecuted under the criminal law.:</p>

<p>âAnother count of the indictment against appellee alleges that he 'asked, demanded, exacted, solicited, sought, accepted, received and agreed to receive' money 'for and because of official acts performed by him in respect to his action, vote and decision on postage rate legislation which had been pending before him in his official capacity. . . .' </p>
