<p>State Convention Kicks Offâ¦Romney does Michiganâ¦Candidates make the Roundsâ¦75 days of Broken Promises hits the streetâ¦A Great start of the Convention!</p>

<p>Thousands of Michigan Republicans gathered last night in Oakland County as we kicked off our State Convention.&nbsp; Michigan Republicans smell blood!</p>

<p><a href="http://migop.blogs.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/romney.jpg"><img title="Romney" height="672" alt="Romney" src="http://migop.blogs.com/blog/images/romney.jpg" width="500" border="0" /></a> </p>





























<p>Governor Mitt Romney, who chairs the Republican Governors Association, hosted a âpizza and politicsâ party for all the attendees.&nbsp; He took the time to talk with many as he thanked all for their work and stressed how important it was to elect Dick DeVos as our next Governor.&nbsp; Governor Romney was clearly the âhitâ of&nbsp; Friday night.&nbsp; He worked the convention hall and his tent reception like a classic âcandidateâ.&nbsp; </p>

<p>While participating in the âround robinsâ with all our statewide candidates, Romney pitched his role as the Republican Governors Association chair and the importance of electing Dick DeVos our next Governor.&nbsp; Here is where âwe Republican Governorsâ stand on the issues and this is why itâs important that you elect Dick DeVos as your next Governorâ¦and with out saying a word, his âsignalâ for â08 was lout and clear.</p>

<p>Congressional Districts held their caucuses last night.&nbsp; SOS Terri Lynn Land and AG Mike Cox along with Sheriff Michael Bouchard and Betsy DeVos on behalf of Dick made the rounds with our other statewide candidates.&nbsp; Everyone shared their excitement and vision for what Michigan could be with new leadership!</p>

<p>We ended up the evening at a party hosted by our Congressional District Chairs.&nbsp; Senator Lott delivered a taped message thanking the grassroots activists for their time and efforts.</p>

<p>This morning, we will be delivering our 75 days of Broken Promises calendar to all the delegates and alternates attending the convention.&nbsp; We distributed thousand this weekend and mailing more to activists around the state.&nbsp; &nbsp;This calendar documents 75 promises that Governor Granholm has made as a politician and hasnât kept as Governor.&nbsp; Surprise?</p>

<p>Governor Granholm has made many promises on the most important issues that the people of Michigan face today, such as the economy, education and public safety.</p>

<p>No one forced her to make these promises.&nbsp; The fact is, she didâ¦and she hasnât come close to coming through.&nbsp; Granholmâ¦nothing more than politics as usual.</p>

<p>Today we will formally nominate our slate of candidates to help turn Michigan around.&nbsp; We have one of the strongest tickets the Republicans have ever put forthâ¦giving the people of Michigan a clear choiceâ¦the failed policies of the past or new leadership for the future.</p>

<p>The plan is finish off our convention with a bus tour around the state over the next few days.&nbsp; Statewide candidates will be joining Dick DeVos and Mike Bouchard on a tour throughout Michigan.</p>

<p>This afternoon, Dick&nbsp; DeVos, LG Ruth Johnson, Sheriff Mike Bouchard, Speaker Craig DeRoche and yours truly, the state party chairman,&nbsp; will be leading a âBiker for DeVosâ ride through Downriver Michigan.&nbsp; We anticipate a group of bikers from the metro Detroit area to join us and visit a number of cities and stopsâ¦as Michigan Republicans send a signal to the voters of Michigan that this is not âyour fathers Republican partyâ.</p>

<p>The future of the Republican party is bold, innovative and committed to help turn Michigan around.&nbsp; Our party is diverse, invigorated and ready to lead!!!</p>

<p>Join us in this battle to help turn Michigan around.&nbsp; Together, we can make every day count!!!</p>

<div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Speaking at a taping of the public television program &quot;Off the Record,&quot; Connerly said, &quot;People don't want to get on the bad side of Dick DeVos.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong><span>Grand Old Preferences</span></strong><br /><strong><span>Michigan Republicans undercut Ward Connerly.</span></strong><br /><span>by Henry Payne</span><br /><span>8/26/2006 12:04:00 AM, Volume 011, Issue 47</span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>THIS YEAR, Michigan was supposed to be the latest victory in conservative activist Ward Connerly's state-by-state battle to enforce the language of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and end racial discrimination in government hiring. Instead, Michigan may well be his movement's graveyard, thanks to strong opposition from an unexpected corner: Republicans. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Connerly's Michigan Civil Rights Initiative (MCRI) is a near carbon copy of his successful ballot initiatives in California (1996) and Washington (1998). According to its original ballot language, the initiative would not permit state discrimination &quot;against, or grant preferential treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity, or national origin.&quot; In California, for example, this has meant an end to minority set-asides in government contracting, as well as a shift in minority enrollment within the state's university system away from elite universities and into lesser-known schools.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Which is where the trouble begins. Republicans here see an opportunity: Michigan is the only state other than hurricane-ravaged Louisiana and Mississippi to have lost jobs in the current economic boom. So, intent on exploiting Michigan's weak economy to capture the governor's office and perhaps even Debbie Stabenow's Senate seat, the state GOP has jettisoned controversial elements of its platform. Opposition to racial preferences isn't the only thing the party has abandoned. In their rush to the squishy middle, Michigan Republicans have also spearheaded drives to hike the minimum wage by 35 percent and condemn oil company greed.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>LANSING -- The state Parole Board has scheduled a Sept. 25 hearing on a Montcalm County woman's request for a medical commutation of her prison term. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&quot;She'll never make it,&quot; said Michele Perrin, of Comstock Park, Carla Ringleka's stepmother. Ringleka is terminally ill with cancer. </span></p>

<div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The decision to hold the hearing came after Gov. Jennifer Granholm asked the parole board to reconsider its earlier vote against releasing Ringleka. The board set the hearing in September, Granholm spokeswoman Liz Boyd said, because someone objected to the governor's request that it waive the usual 30-day waiting period. </span></p>

<h1><u><span>Katrina's Damage Lingers For Bush</span><span></span></u></h1>

<h2><span>Many See Storm as President's Undoing</span></h2>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For Rep. Patrick T. McHenry (R-N.C.), three images define George W. Bush's presidency: Bush throwing out the first pitch of the 2001 World Series at Yankee Stadium, Bush with a megaphone atop the rubble of the World Trade Center -- and Bush staring out the window as Air Force One traversed the Gulf Coast thousands of feet above the devastation of Hurricane Katrina.<span></span></span></p>

<div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The first two images epitomize strength and resolution, the image the Bush White House likes to cultivate. But in one year's time, the last one -- of the president as aloof, out of touch, even befuddled -- all but erased the memory of the others, according to pollsters, pundits and Republican politicians who say they have suffered in the wake of the president's decline.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Welfare reform turned 10 this week, and more remarkable than its near-total success is the near-total amnesia that seems to have gripped its one-time opponents. The results and the history are both worth revisiting today because they offer some useful political and policy lessons for the future. </span></p>

<div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>When Bill Clinton signed the bill ending a federal entitlement to welfare, a leading liberal newspaper called it &quot;nasty,&quot; &quot;atrocious&quot; and &quot;odious&quot;--adding with typical nuance that &quot;the children will suffer the most.&quot; Three Clinton Administration officials resigned over the bill. Georgia Congressman John Lewis not too subtly raised the specter of fascism as he literally screamed on the House floor, &quot;They're coming for the children. They're coming for the poor. They're coming for the sick, the elderly and the disabled.&quot; Even as sensible a social scientist as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan lost his head and called it &quot;something approaching an apocalypse.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>WASHINGTON (AP) -- Wider but still restricted access to the morning-after pill may not have the dramatic effect on unintended pregnancy and abortion rates touted by some advocates, reproductive health experts say.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Expanded access should spur increased sales of the pills, called Plan B, but it probably won't have a major public health impact, they said Friday.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&quot;That doesn't mean zero, but it will be hard to measure because it will be so small,&quot; said James Trussell, director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton University. &quot;If you look at the number of acts of unprotected intercourse on one hand, and the use of Plan B on the other, it's like a cork on the ocean.&quot;</span></p>

<div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Planned Parenthood hailed Thursday's decision by the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday to allow nonprescription sales of the pills to adult women, saying expanded access could prevent up to 1.5 million unintended pregnancies and 800,000 abortions a year.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Flint's rich industrial history includes a hard-fought battle against pollution, which began in the 1970s and continues to this day. But the fight faces a major setback, as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lays plans to take away a key weapon: knowledge. </span></p>

<div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>The EPA would do so by cutting back Toxic Release Inventory reports from an annual requirement to every two years, while at the same time allowing companies to release 10 times more of a toxic chemical than is now allowed before reporting was required of them. One major nefarious effect would be to reduce reporting demands for persistent bioaccumulative toxins, or PBTs, which include lead - one of the potentially deadliest pollutants. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>&quot;As havens of enjoyment, recreation, learning and personal renewal, national parks must endure,&quot; said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, while opening a new visitor education center Friday at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, Idaho and Montana.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><strong>T</strong> he cowboy has been retired. Multilateralism is back. Diplomacy is king.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>ARLINGTON, Va.--In his 1983 &quot;Star Wars&quot; speech, Ronald Reagan famously asked, &quot;What if free people could live secure in the knowledge . . . that we could intercept and destroy strategic ballistic missiles before they reached our own soil?&quot; </span></p>

<div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>Fast forward to this summer. On July 4 North Korea test-fired a long-range ballistic missile believed capable of reaching the continental U.S. The launch was a flop--the Taepodong 2 fizzled before it got off the ground--but to echo Reagan's question, <em>what if?</em> What would have happened if Pyongyang's missile had been heading toward Los Angeles? Could we have shot it down? &quot;I'm confident that we could have,&quot; states Lt. Gen. Henry &quot;Trey&quot; Obering III, director of the Missile Defense Agency. &quot;If that missile had proceeded to threaten Hawaii or the continental United States, then we would have had the ability to shoot it down.

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>WASHINGTON (AP) -- A veteran U.S. diplomat will spend the weekend in jail on charges he traded work visas for lavish dinners, New York City hotel rooms, jewelry and Las Vegas trips with exotic dancers.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Michael John O'Keefe, the deputy nonimmigrant visa chief at the U.S. Consulate in Toronto, was indicted on bribery and conspiracy charges Friday. International jewelry executive Sunil Agrawal, a native of India, also was charged but remains at large.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Since the terrorist attacks of 2001, authorities have worked to tighten controls over nonimmigrant visas like those granted to students, tourists and workers.

<div><p class="MsoNormal"><span>O'Keefe personally handled STS applications, going so far as to approve some that had been rejected, even when a subordinate noted that terrorists use jewelry to raise money, the indictment says.
