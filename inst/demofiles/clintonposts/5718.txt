You know what they say: there are no small parts, only small <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/science/space/25pluto.html?hp&ex=1156478400&en=f662a15c093b5844&ei=5094&partner=homepage">planets</a>.<br /><br />Only apparently there arenât. Small planets, I mean. Small parts? They exist. I never believed that fuzzy theater b.s., though Iâm not about to disillusion the kid playing Boy Among the Dead #3 in <em>Our Town</em>. I had a small part in my high-school production of <em>West Side Story</em>. One of the Jetsâ girlfriends -- not Riffâs. My name was either Patsy or Annette, depending on which source you consulted. The script said Patsy, but our director (whom I still love) consistently referred to me as Annette. âNo, no, Annette. Cheat <em>left</em> during the dance at the gym, not right!â <br /><br />My best friends Hillary and Jessica also had small parts. They were Fernando and Conchita, members of the Sharks gang. During the dance at the gym, they could have danced together -- since Hillary was a boy; Jessica was a girl; and they were both of the appropriate Bernsteinian cult. But our director paired them with other kids. I donât remember which pseudo-Latina wound up as Hillaryâs partner, but Jessica cha-chaed with a middle schooler named Chad, who compensated for his runty height with a voice that might have raised Tony from the dead. âShe said cheat LEFT,â Chad hollered. âNot RIGHT.â<br /><br />There may have been confusion about my characterâs name, but at least nobody mixed up my gender. âYouâre a GIRL, Hillary,â Chad reminded us. âSo you walk with the GIRLS.â But no, Hillary wasnât a girl. Or Fernando wasnât. âIâm actually a boy,â Hillary said, patting Chadâs head, which reached her taped chest. <br /><br />If I were Hillary, I would have protested the random gender assignment, just after I stabbed Chad with a rose corsage. Hillary really did buy into the âsmall partsâ adage, though. After gently correcting Chad, she got right back into character, eyeing me suspiciously across the dance floor. Not only had she memorized the âdance at the gym,â she knew the choreography for the entire show -- from Tonyâs opening number through the âSomewhereâ farewell sequence. She performed âCoolâ as we stood in line for shepherdâs pie at the cafeteria. âHey, thatâs <em>my </em>number,â I protested. âChill yourself out, peach,â she sneered. âOr Iâll cut you.â<br /><br />Pluto would do well to take a lesson from Hillary. True, it was not dropped from the Big Nine due to its size. What did they knife Pluto for again? Something about how it interferes with Neptuneâs orbit. Were I Pluto, I would tell astronomers to stick it to Uranus. What kind of a name is Uranus? Our middle-school English teacher chose to change Uranusâs name during her Greek mythology unit. After quieting yet another chorus of guffaws, she started calling Uranus by his Roman name, Caelus. I think if Uranusâs title can be altered that quickly, he doesnât deserve to be a planet. Pluto is a beloved Disney <em>pet</em>, for peteâs sake. Would you shoot a dog?<br /><br />Obviously, the astronomers pay as much attention to me as Hillary did to Chad. Never mind. To Pluto, I say: keep doing your galactic dance. Thereâs a place for you. Somewhere.
