<p>As the days go by, Iowa looms larger. What is currentlyÂ the most important 2008 buzzword? <a href="http://www.radioiowa.com/gestalt/go.cfm?objectid=D5795F0A-B6F1-42D5-BAFE893FF92C0F4E" target="_blank">Ethanol</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over a dozen potential presidential candidates have poured into Iowa this month and most made a point to mention their support of ethanol and the state&#8217;s other energy projects. Republican Newt Gingrich, the former Speaker of the U.S. House, told a crowd at the State Fair that ethanol&#8217;s time has arrived because the influence of so-called &#8220;big oil&#8221; has waned in Washington with pump prices at about three-dollars-a-gallon.</p>
<p>&#8220;We actually have to encourage ordinary Americans to understand the significance and the importance of it to their ordinary lives, not just the $3 a gallon price they&#8217;re paying at the pump, but what it&#8217;s doing to their country,&#8221; Vilsack said. &#8220;What this really needs to be is an issue of patriotism, building a stronger America and a more secure America.&#8221;</p>
<p>New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, a Democrat who served as U.S. Energy Secretary for President Clinton, was in Iowa last week and he made a pitch not only for ethanol, but other &#8220;renewable&#8221; forms of energy.&#8221;It&#8217;s not just that we become more energy efficient by using solar, wind, biomass, ethanol,&#8221; Richardson said. &#8220;It creates jobs &#8212; technology jobs, High-wage jobs. They&#8217;d be created right here in Iowa.&#8221; Richardson declared Iowa the center for renewable energy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Suprise! Senator McCain is nowÂ touting Ethanol&#8217;s promise:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even Republican John McCain, the Arizona Senator who opposes the federal tax break for ethanol, spoke in favor of the fuel during a speech in Grinnell on August 15th. &#8220;My position on ethanol was (and) is support of ethanol when oil went over $40 a barrel. I do not support subsidies but I support ethanol and I think it is a vital, a vital alternative energy source not only because of our dependency on foreign oil but its greenhouse gas reduction effects,&#8221; McCain said.</p>
<p>McCain declared himself a &#8220;strong&#8221; supporter of ethanol.</p></blockquote>
