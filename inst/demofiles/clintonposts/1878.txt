<br />The Democrats, in a wave of unoriginality, are using the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina to overwhelm the public with the knowledge of the ineptitude of the Republican party and its leaders. They hope it will translate into victory and more senate and house seats this November. Click LINK below for more of the article.<br />
<br />Even conservatives are admitting that as many as 40 house seats could go Democrat come the mid-term elections. Two months ago, I predicted a most welcome win for democrats this November. I believe most of the coming victory will be a result of America's disenchantment with the war in Iraq. We simply don't believe that our soldiers should babysit a civil war. Plus, American remembers well the total limpness and ineffectiveness of the Republicans shortly after Hurricane Katrina hit.<br />
<br />However, the Democratic party is so heavily into infighting that it disgusts me. Instead of pushing Joe Lieberman away because he's hawkish on the war, they should be embracing him and putting on a united front, thankful that Smokin' Joe votes with them the other 95% of the time.<br />
<br />The Democrats must act on their own ingrained principles and quit worrying about the latest polls on what Americans think. Most people are fickle in much of politics, so politicians must lead the way, as Harry Truman and Franklin Roosevelt did in their day. Did John Kennedy check the polls when the Soviets were installing nuclear weapons in Cuba?<br />
<br />The Neo-cons have their agenda and their ideas. The Democrats are wishy-washy. Recently, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has flip-flopped on the war in Iraq. During the '04 presidential election, John Kerry acted willy-nilly over the war. We need politicians who will not change their minds on matters such as the Iraqi war, people like Howard Dean and Dennis Kucinich who say 'Get Out of Iraq Now. '<br />
<br />The Democrats must get over losing the 2000 and 2004 elections and get used to the Republicans being King of the Hill. At least for now. In order to get their rightful place back, they must have a clear agenda and laid-out ideas and principles.<br />
<br />Unless they do, I fully advocate the destruction and dissolution of the Democratic Party as they appear to be imploding anyway. After their total annihilation which could start in the 2008 elections, what remains will be strong, principled and resolute. From the ashes of their own inflicted hellfire, the Phoenix of the New Progressive Party must and will rise. True leadership will emerge and a liberal program and set of ideas will be born.<br />
