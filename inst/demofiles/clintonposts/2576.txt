It's probably inevitable, but this sort of thing irritates me.  From <em>The Economist</em>'s <a href="http://economist.com/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=7796602">review</a> of Bruce Reed and  Big Ideas Emanuel's <em>The Plan: Big Ideas for America</em>:
</p><blockquote>
If the system is made more efficient, Mr Emanuel thinks coverage can be extended to all American children. But he concedes that a nation as individualistic as America will probably never accept a European-style national health serviceâand he should know, having worked on Hillary Clinton's doomed health project in the 1990s. He argues, however, that maybe, some day, every American might receive a voucher for basic health services from the insurer of his or her choice.
</blockquote><p>
How interesting -- Emanuel dismisses the chances for a universal health system, but leaves open the option for an absurdly complicated voucher scheme, precisely the sort offered up by his brother, the bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel, in <em><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_06/006457.php">The Washington Monthly</a></em> awhile back (which I took on <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/emanuels_object.html">here</a>).  All those who occasionally speculate about Emanuel's fitness for Speaker of the House should take this statement very seriously: He does not believe in any sort of coherent national health care system.  On the bright side, his family values seem strong.

Incidentally, I've flipped through <em>The Plan</em> a bit, and I doubt I've ever seen a book with a subtitle so deeply misleading.  This is warmed over, second term Clintonism at its incrementialist.  I'm one of six people in this country who get excited over policy papers and even I wanted to cry.  The typical chapter would mention an awesome Big Idea, then decide it's politically unfeasible, and promise to push 1/10th the policy but with More! Awesome! Market! Mechanisms!
