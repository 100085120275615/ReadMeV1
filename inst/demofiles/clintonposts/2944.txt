<div>Being a Communication Arts graduate, I'm supposed to be into indie movies. But to tell you the truth, I enjoy "teeny bopper" movies. I grew up on <em>Clueless</em> the mother and pioneer of all teeny bopper movies. I used to spend almost one entire summer watching that movie over and over and over. I liked <em>Jawbreaker</em>. Makes me suddenly think about my age. I'm getting old, those movies are already as considered modern classics but I was in high school when those were first shown. Now, Alicia Silverstone and Rose McGowan are adults and have adult movies. A new generation is already taking over the silverscreen.<br />
<br />I recently watched <em>She's the man </em>I was quite pleasantly surprised that the movie was OK. Its not the best, but it was OK. It wasn't a waste of money like other movies that don't have stories. At least this one had one. It was just the usual girl-with-boyfriend-does-something-and-falls-in-love-with-the-new-guy type of movie. But the movie was cute. This is the story. Viola loves soccer but her school's girls team was turned down/closed (I forgot the term they used). And her boyfriend suddenly turns against her and doesn't support her fight to re-open her team. So she decides to take action. She goes to her twin brother's new school and pretends to be him as he goes off to another country to play with his band. She eventually plays for the school's soccer team as her brother and falls in love with her brother's roommate/teammate. Finally at the day of the game against her school she explains to her new love interest that she's not a guy and has fallen for him. As usual the guy is hurt and is mad at her but eventually they get together and become teammates in the school's soccer team. Its the usual teeny bopper story.<br />
<br />Why did I enjoy it eventhough it's the usual story. First, it had funny scenes. And I mean funny. I'm the hard to make me laugh person, I acutally laughed out loud while watching the movie. Two, Duke (Amanda Bynes' love interest, Channing Tatum in real life) is hot. And I mean HOT. He's cute and has a great body. He had scenes where he had to be shirtless. Girls, I recommend you watch the movie just to see him. Well I guess thats it. Its not the best movie, but you'll enjoy it. One thing I didn't like though. I didn't like Amanda Bynes' comedic antics and looks because it obviously looked like she was acting. I enjoy movies that seem like you're watching the real thing, not seeing actors and actress act. Also, I like Hillary Duff and Lindsay Lohan more than Amanda Bynes.<br />
<br />Anyway, I guess whatever age I am I'll still enjoy teeny bopper movies because its the type of movie that doesn't require you to think. Sometimes after a hard day's work and after your stressful life you want an opportunity to enjoy without exerting too much effort. I like doing this sometimes. Watching a movie that makes you laugh and enjoy the moment to make you forget about everything. Its my escape. And for that 1 and 1/2 hours of watching She's the man. I forgot my worries.</div>
