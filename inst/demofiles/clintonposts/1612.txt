<p>It's an issue I bring out from time to time, most recently in <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/nosenada/2006/08/science_losing_a_good_friend_i_1.php" target="blank">yesterday's</a> Lieberman science support post.  To wit: science R&D; backers and grant supplicants like to whine about getting screwed by The Man in budget season.  The endless "Call your Senator and ask them to support increased funding for **** in S.4096!!" emails are one example.</p>
<p>Before you worry about money, though, and maybe let your personal politics get the better of your sound judgment, you need to look at and understand the numbers.  And yesterday Roger <a href="http://sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/prometheus/archives/rd_funding/000901the_ever_increasing_.html" target="blank">laid it out for you</a>.</p>
<p>Excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
By President, the percentage of federal discretionary spending devoted to R&D;:

<p>Reagan 12.5%<br />
Bush I 13.3%<br />
Clinton 13.6%<br />
Bush II 13.7%</p>
<p>By Control of the House, the percentage of federal discretionary spending devoted to R&D; since 1982:</p>
<p>Democrats: 12.8%<br />
Republicans: 13.7%</p>
<p>This data suggests to me first that the S&T; lobby has been incredibly successful in increasing the portion of the federal devoted to R&D....;<br />

<p>Sure, certain programs go through ups and downs, but the overall portfolio has consistently done very well through time.  I understand why some would complain about the ups and downs, especially when it affects <i>their</i> piece of the pie.  But that's decision-making in a fluid democracy.</p>
