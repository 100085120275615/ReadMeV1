It looks like Jacques Chirac wants to step into the ring and duke it out with Internet heavyweights Yahoo! and Google. <br /><br />Earlier this week, the <a href="http://technology.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,329465292-117802,00.html">French president announced an initiative</a> whereby France will spend well north of $2 billion on a series of technological projects; including building an Internet search engine, an unlimited mobile TV, and a French hybrid diesel vehicle. <br /><br />(By any chance, was Mr. Chirac a guest of Hillary Clinton's during her Chicago Economic Club speech earlier this month? This French plan sounds startingly similar to Mrs. Clinton's <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200604181516.asp">"<strong>National Investment Authority</strong>"</a> if you ask me..)<br /><br />The French president added that he would like to avoid a future in which France was known only as a "museum country".<br /><br />Looks like Chirac may be a day late and a Euro short.
