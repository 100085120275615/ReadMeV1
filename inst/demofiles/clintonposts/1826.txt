<strong>
<span>Well I wasn't going to do a personal post for a while. I have done plenty the last week or two.<br />But some man/person left a comment on my site that gave me pause. He broke the rule. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong>
<span>
<span>DO AS YOU WILL HARM NONE.</span>
<br />
<br />His comment would have offended my family members.<br />And buddy when you tread on my on my family. You walk on the fighten'  side of me. Any comment from this day forward directed at any member of my family will be deleted should I find it an insult.<br />
<br />Very few people know me or my family. I am amazed to daily watch the world around me. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>First: I do not claim to be a Christian. I am a believer.</span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>Second: I follow the old traditions.  Let me clarify that I am an American Indian/Euro mix. I can trace my ancestors back nearly to the days of Christ. I am a decendant of the the DAR proven fact that  a direct ancestor was a body guard to George Washington. (By the way I didn't prove that.) Also a daughter of the Mayflower.  </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>I have a pedigree that most would envy. When my daughter says she is a princess well start tracing my linage and you will find that is true. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>The other side of the family is Mohawk this to is proven by lineage. So to any jackass out there that wants to tell me that I am not a Citizen of this nation I say this. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>Its the damn Euro trash that started the problems here. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>My Grand mothers walked the fucking trail of tears. Every damn step. They were married to the Euro trash.</span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>I hear how the black man was a slave. Well folks lets look at the true history of this nation. Then come back and tell me how it was only the black man. When it was the white man that broke the food staff of my ancestors and left them to die with the pox or starvation. The white man that drove them like cattle and removed them from their lands. So that those same lands could be stolen. Every step any white person takes in this nation is a step on the lands shared by the Native peoples here. Land the Euro's stole.</span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>You want to insult me well get in line. You want to insult my family well then you will come through me.  </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>There has never been a war that a member of my family has not been there. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>Ever since this nation was founded including the Revolution. There were decades that my people were oppressed and kept down. Generations of new religions and oppression. We survived. I will not allow any Euro trash to set me or mine back. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>Once again to make my point. This is my nation and I am proud of it. Through the blood of all of my ancestors I have the right to voice my opinion.  </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>Third: I have never claimed an initial after my name. I have mentioned that I am a democrat and in the center.  On occasion I have stated that I believe my party was hi-jacked and like any hijacking it has gone to seed. We dems have no leaders. All we have is nuts. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>GOT THAT NUTS.  AS IN KOOKU FOR COACOA PUFFS.  </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>I can not give you a name for 08 that I or mine would vote for if there is a D after the name. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>This is because of the likes of Hillary, Kerry, Kennedy, Durbin and the list goes on. Zell Miller and Lieberman were the last of the true democrats.   </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>Fourth: Before you take the liberty to assume anything about me then study yourself approved.</span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>Fifth: Reguarding Islam  General Curtis LaMay said when they get tired of dying we will quit killing them.</span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span></span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>
<span>I consider myself and mine <span>MAINSTREAM AMERICANS</span>, we earned that title. We walked the walk. Have you?</span>
