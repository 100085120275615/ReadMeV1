&nbsp;<p>The defeat of Senator Joe Lieberman by the upstart
antiwar Democrat Ned Lamont has sparked a firestorm of debate about the
direction of the Democratic Party. My own heart is with those Democrats
who worry that just calling for a pullout from Iraq, while it may be
necessary, is not a sufficient response to the biggest threat to open
societies today â violent, radical Islam. Unless Democrats persuade
voters â in the gut â that they understand this larger challenge, itâs
going to be hard for them to win the presidency</p>

</div><blockquote><p>That said, though, the
Democratic mainstream is nowhere near as dovish as critics depict.
Truth be told, some of the most constructive, on-the-money criticism
over the past three years about how to rescue Iraq or improve the
broader âwar on terrorismâ has come from Democrats, like Joe Biden,
Carl Levin, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Bill Clinton.</p>

<p> But whatever you think of the Democrats, the important point is this: They are not the party in power today.</p>

<p>What
should really worry the country is not whether the Democrats are being
dragged to the left by antiwar activists who havenât thought a whit
about the larger struggle weâre in. What should worry the country is
that the Bush team and the Republican Party, which control all the
levers of power and claim to have thought <span class="italic">only </span>about this larger struggle, are in total denial about where their strategy has led.</p>

<p>Besides
a few mavericks like Chuck Hagel and John McCain on Iraq and Dick Lugar
and George Shultz on energy, how many Republicans have stood up and
questioned the decision-making that has turned the Iraq war into a
fiasco? Had more of them done so, instead of just mindlessly applauding
the administration, the White House might have changed course when it
had a chance.</p>

<p>Not only is there no honest self-criticism among
Republicans, but â and this is truly contemptible â you have Dick
Cheney &amp; Friends focusing their public remarks on why Mr. Lamontâs
defeat of Mr. Lieberman only proves that Democrats do not understand
that we are in a titanic struggle with âIslamic fascistsâ and are
therefore unfit to lead.</p>

<p>Oh, really? Well, I just have one
question for Mr. Cheney: If weâre in such a titanic struggle with
radical Islam, and if getting Iraq right is at the center of that
struggle, why did you âtough guysâ fight the Iraq war with the Rumsfeld
Doctrine â just enough troops to lose â and not the Powell Doctrine of
overwhelming force to create the necessary foundation of any
democracy-building project, which is security? How could you send so
few troops to fight such an important war when it was obvious that
without security Iraqis would fall back on their tribal militias?</p>

<p>
Mr. Cheney, if weâre in a titanic struggle with Islamic fascists, why
have you and President Bush resisted any serious effort to get
Americans to conserve energy? Why do you refuse to push higher mileage
standards for U.S. automakers or a gasoline tax that would curb our
imports of oil? Here we are in the biggest struggle of our lives and we
are funding both sides â the U.S. military with our tax dollars and the
radical Islamists and the governments and charities that support them
with our gasoline purchases â and you wonât lift a finger to change
that. Why? Because it might impose pain on the oil companies and auto
lobbies that fund the G.O.P., or require some sacrifice by Americans.</p>

<p>Mr.
Cheney, if weâre in a titanic struggle with Islamic fascists, why do
you constantly use the âwar on terrorismâ as a wedge issue in domestic
politics to frighten voters away from Democrats. How are we going to
sustain such a large, long-term struggle if we are a divided country?</p>

<p>Please,
Mr. Cheney, spare us your flag-waving rhetoric about the titanic
struggle we are in and how Democrats just donât understand it. It is
just so phony â such a patent ploy to divert Americans from the fact
that you have never risen to the challenge of this war. You will the
ends, but you wonât will the means. What a fraud!</p>

<p>Friends, we are
on a losing trajectory in Iraq, and, as the latest London plot
underscores, the wider war with radical Islam is only getting wider. We
need to reassess <span class="italic">everything</span> we are doing
in this âwar on terrorismâ and figure out what is worth continuing,
what needs changing and what sacrifice we need to demand from every
American to match our means with our ends. Yes, the Democrats could
help by presenting a serious alternative. But unless the party in power
for the next two and half years shakes free of its denial, we are in
really, really big trouble. </p></blockquote><p><span>I have a suggestion for Friedman and the New York Times.&nbsp; Let's spend some time and resources investigating how Bush and Cheney pressured the Brits to go prematurely after Muslims who were a long ways from being able to put bombs on planes.&nbsp; Let's spend more time holding Bush and Cheney accountable for lying about terror in order to reap political advantage.&nbsp; Good start today guys.&nbsp; Keep it up.</span></p></div></div>
