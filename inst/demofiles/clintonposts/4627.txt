<p>It&#8217;s clear by Obama&#8217;s trip to Africa, especially his &#8220;homecoming&#8221; to Kenya that he is a well-liked figure abroad, as well as at home. When Hillary travels abroad, does anyone give a crap? </p>
<p>We need someone like Obama in the White House to start to undo the damage that has been done by Bush during his two terms.
