<br />The clock continues to click towards the 2008 presidential election, and we're still certain that Al Gore is the best candidate the Democrats can put forth. Is he waiting in the wings, playing it coy as he builds a team that now includes former 2000 campaign aide Roy Neel? Is he ready to go head-to-head against Hillary Clinton for the nomination? Will he soon announce? The time for Gore could not be better. As we've stated here many times before, our money's on him running. <br />
