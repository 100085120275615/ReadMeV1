Hillary Clinton of New York on Tuesday lit into the oil company that had to temporarily shut down a corroded Alaskan pipeline, arguing the firm should be held responsible for fixing it.<br />
<br />
</u>"BP should use some of the billions of dollars in excess, windfall profits to fix that pipeline without passing on the cost to the rest of us," Clinton said to thunderous applause. "I am tired of cleaning up the messes of oil companies that are making more money than they know what to do with."</blockquote>
