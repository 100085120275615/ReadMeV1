<p>The Repulican party paved the way for the abolition of slavery, but will Democrats capture the next milestone?  Illinois Democratic Senator <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14527295/ " target="new">Barack Obama</a> is making headlines, and just might be setting himself up for a 2012 race for the Oval Office.  His first major international move as a Senator is to take aim at AIDS in Africa, starting in his father's native Kenya:</p>

<blockquote>Obama planned to visit a clinic run by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Kisumu, a city in the same western region as Nyangoma-Kogelo. There he will be tested for AIDS in an effort to remove some of the stigma attached to the procedure.</blockquote>

<p>Obama has been active recently in speaking out about the problem of AIDS infection in Africa, and apparently is willing to call a spade a spade, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14452247/" target="new">bashing</a> South African government officials on their support for "herbal treatment" of AIDS patients:</p>

<blockquote>"The minister of health here has tended to equate traditional medicines to anti-retrovirals (ARV), so on the treatment side the information being provided by the minister of health is not accurate," he said.
It is not an issue of Western science versus African science, it is just science and it's not right," Obama told reporters outside an AIDS clinic in Cape Town's Khayelitsha township.</blockquote>

<p>Although he has had the spotlight since becoming the only black Senator in the nation, Obama's victory in the Senate race of 2004 did not require Clinton-esque personality.  The only serious challenger from the Republican side, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race when big media outlets sued for and won the release of <a href="http://www.ilsenate.com/" target="new"> divorce documents</a> detailing accusations by Ryan's ex wife of lurid sexual habits.</p>

<p>2012 is lightyears away in terms of politics, but Obama is one Democrat and Black American to pay careful attention to.  It's always possible that, like his former opponent Jack Ryan, he has some skeletons in his closet.  For the time being, however, unless he turns out to be a closet swinger (like Ryan was alleged to be) or something similarly shocking, he is shaping up to be a serious contender for future Presidential races.</p>
