<div align="justify">Americans Not Thankful This Holiday Season for State of Air Travel, Mexico President-Elect Vincente Fox Set to Take Office, Florida`s Secretary of State Declares George W. Bush the Winner, CBS<br />
<br />THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.<br />
<br />(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br />
<br />STEVE KROFT, CBS NEWS (voice-over): It begins with the construction detour signs at the airport entrance, followed by a 30-minute wait at the ticket counter. Next you`re packed into the cabin of an overbooked flight, only to be held hostage on the tarmac for 40 minutes waiting to take off.<br />
<br />(on camera): It`s going to get worse.<br />
<br />PROF. DARRELL JENKINS (ph): It will get worse.<br />
<br />KROFT: How much worse?<br />
<br />JENKINS: It will get worse up to the point where you no longer can tolerate the pain. At that point, you will rise up against your local congressional leaders and force them to do something.<br />
<br />MORLEY SAFER, CBS NEWS (voice-over): For most of the last century, Mexico`s been ruled by a single party, a party ridden with corruption, kickbacks and cronyism. And then along came a man on horseback who, in a free and democratic election, became the president of Mexico. The appeal of Vicente Fox seemed to combine the warmth of Ronald Reagan and the bravado of Jesse Ventura, confident that his legacy when he leaves office will be a different Mexico than the one we know.<br />
<br />MIKE WALLACE, CBS NEWS: I`m Mike Wallace.<br />
<br />SAFER: I`m Morley Safer.<br />
<br />ED BRADLEY, CBS NEWS: I`m Ed Bradley.<br />
<br />KROFT: I`m Steve Kroft.<br />
<br />LESLEY STAHL, CBS NEWS: I`m Lesley Stahl. Those stories, Andy Rooney and the latest on the presidential election tonight on 60 MINUTES.<br />
<br />(END VIDEOTAPE)<br />
<br />DAN RATHER, CBS NEWS: And with the latest on the presidential election, I`m Dan Rather in CBS News world and election headquarters in New York.<br />
<br />Nineteen days after the presidential election, Florida`s Republican secretary of state is about to announce the winner, as she sees it and she decrees it, of the state`s potentially decisive 25 electoral votes. Katherine Harris will officially certify the state`s election returns. If, as we expect, it happens very shortly now, we will bring you the announcement live and then pick up 60 Minutes right where it left off. You won`t miss a thing.<br />
<br />We believe certification, as the Republican secretary of state sees it, is coming just hours after a court-ordered deadline for counties to submit their hand count and recount totals. Harris turned down a request by Palm Beach County to extend that deadline until tomorrow morning. She said, no, she would not do that. Even so, Palm Beach decided to go ahead with its hand count past the deadline of this afternoon. Now, what becomes of those additional hand-counted votes, no one can quite say.<br />
<br />According to unofficial tallies by news services, Governor George Bush of Texas was leading Vice President Gore by something akin to 357 votes.<br />
<br />Now, we`re going to pause to let some of our stations join us for a special report. We`ll be right back.<br />
<br />Now back at CBS News election headquarters. Some of our stations are joining us for this special report.<br />
<br />The reason we`re on the air right across the board nationally right now is because Florida`s secretary of state, Republican, as we`ve mentioned before, campaigned actively for George Bush, well-connected to the -- Governor Bush`s governor brother, Jeb Bush in Florida, but a woman who has consistently said, "I`m trying to do my job right down to the letter of the law as best I can." She has said that she will be out in a very short time here now. And what`s expected of her is that she will certify, as she sees it, who gets Florida`s 25 electoral votes. Those 25 electoral votes potentially will be decisive.<br />
<br />As of the moment, Vice President Al Gore leads in the national popular vote. He leads in the Electoral College vote. However, he has 267 in the Electoral College vote. It takes 270 to win. And the 25 electoral votes from Florida are figured to be decisive -- all of this against a background of the U.S. Supreme Court saying that it will hear arguments next Friday.<br />
<br />But here is the secretary of state now to make her long-awaited announcement in Tallahassee, Florida.<br />
<br />KATHERINE HARRIS (R), FLORIDA SECRETARY OF STATE: Good evening. Commissioner Bob Crawford, Director Clay Roberts, ladies and gentlemen, as the state elections canvassing commission, were are here to day to certify the results of the election that occurred November 7th, 2000.<br />
<br />(HARRIS STATEMENT)<br />
<br />HARRIS: Copies of the Palm Beach County document are also -- will also be made available.<br />
<br />RATHER: What`s happening here is that the certification, as the Florida secretary of state sees it and decrees it, is being signed. This obviously is going to take a few minutes, at least a few moments. And after this, it will be, in at least the opinion of the secretary of state, that the results will be final. The secretary of state, as she has restated here, in effect, believes that the election certification that she gives should stand. The Florida state supreme court disagreed, saying that the certification today would be the deadline 5:00 PM.<br />
<br />The secretary of state has said the certification she wanted to give on November 14th should stand. Then the Florida state supreme court set today`s deadline, 5:00 PM, or, they said, she could wait until 9:00 AM tomorrow morning. She declined to do that. That was one of the keys in the Palm Beach hand count, the leaders of that not getting the extension that they had asked for tonight.<br />
<br />As additional signings go on, this is the secretary of state and others certifying the statewide outcome, as they view it. This action is being challenged already. David Boies, the lead lawyer for Democratic Vice President Al Gore`s campaign, said that this certification would be challenged tomorrow on at least three grounds and probably more. That would be an official contest of the election results.<br />
<br />HARRIS: The certified results in the presidential race in Florida is as follows: Governor George W. Bush, 2,912,790. Vice President Al Gore, 2,912,253. Accordingly, on behalf of the state elections canvassing commission and in accordance with the laws of the state of Florida, I hereby declare Governor George W. Bush the winner of Florida`s 25 electoral votes for the president for the United States.<br />
<br />Commissioner Crawford, would you like to address the audience?<br />
<br />BOB CRAWFORD: Thank you, Madam Secretary. Let me first commend you on the job that you and your office have done during these last almost three weeks since the election. This has been a tough election. It has not always been pretty, but we got the job done, and we got...<br />
<br />RATHER: Well, as the praise goes on from behind those microphones for the Florida secretary of state, the Florida secretary of state has just said that, in her opinion -- and she thinks she has the legal right to do it and the legal duty and obligation to do it -- she has certified George Bush as the winner of Florida`s Electoral College votes by a margin of about 537 votes -- not about, exactly 537 votes out of almost six million that were cast.<br />
<br />As we said during the signing, the forces of Vice President Al Gore have said they will now move to officially contest this election on at least three grounds and probably more. This is a very complicated, historic situation. If you`re saying, "Well, does this end it?" the answer is "Not necessarily and not immediately," since the Gore forces say they will contest this. And there`ll be more about this as we go along.<br />
<br />Now, some of our stations will return to their programming. For the rest of you, we`ll be picking up with 60 Minutes, so stay here with us.<br />
<br />ANNOUNCER: This has been a CBS News special report.<br />
<br />(COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br />
<br />KROFT: Ask any of the more than 20 million Americans who have been crammed onto planes during this Thanksgiving holiday, and they`ll tell you that the state of air travel is not one of the things that they`re thankful for. Holiday or not, air travel in the United States has reached the crisis point. The number of flights and the number of people flying is growing faster than the capacity of the system to handle them. With 670 million passengers a year, nearly three times as many as when the government deregulated the airline industry, we`re teetering on the edge of gridlock. One out of every four flights is either canceled, delayed or diverted. And flying has become a crowded, late, undependable, inconvenient but absolutely unavoidable way of getting from here to there.<br />
<br />(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br />
<br />(voice-over): It begins with the construction detour signs at the airport entrance, followed by a 30-minute wait at the ticket counter. Next you`re packed into the cabin of an overbooked flight, only to be held hostage on the tarmac for 40 minutes waiting to take off, which makes you late for your connecting flight. And even if you make it, your luggage might not. Such is the state of air travel today, a fiendishly modern instrument of torture.<br />
<br />PAUL O`BRIEN (ph): I`ve decided that I can`t take that any longer because of the stress that it creates in traveling.<br />
<br />KROFT: Paul O`Brien is a Silicon Valley software executive who flies between coasts nearly every week. He says this is the worst year ever. He`s had it.<br />
<br />(on camera): How has this affected your business?<br />
<br />O`BRIEN: It`s horrible. Number one, it`s a huge effect on the body. And then on top of that, you`re constantly rescheduling, missing meetings, having to reroute yourself, creates additional trips on top of old trips. It`s -- yeah, it`s a huge productivity loss.<br />
<br />KROFT (voice-over): Delays are not only more frequent, they`re getting longer.<br />
<br />REBECCA MORGAN (ph): And it`s not just the delays, Steve. People are agitated when they get on the flight. And so people are jostling for position...<br />
<br />KROFT: Rebecca Morgan is a speaker and management consultant and an experienced road warrior, part of a growing army of people who make their living crisscrossing the country on airplanes.<br />
<br />MORGAN: I even witnessed a fistfight on an airline. The guy in back started strangling the guy in front, and then the guy in front started fistfighting, started punching the guy behind! People`s fuses are short because they`re tired of being lied to by the airlines -- "Oh, it`ll only be 10 minutes."<br />
<br />KROFT: It wasn`t always that way.<br />
<br />TELEVISION COMMERCIAL: Every Delta non-stop is a non-stop party, and you`re invited.<br />
<br />KROFT: There was once a time not that long ago when the airlines touted flying as fun, when flying was exclusive, expensive and regulated. Before 1978, the government controlled which routes the airlines flew, how many flights they offered, what fares they charged. Air travel meant catering to passengers` every need, and occasionally their every fantasy.<br />
<br />UNIDENTIFIED FLIGHT ATTENDANT (television commercial): I`m Jennifer, and I`m going to fly you like you`ve never been flown before. Come fly me!<br />
<br />KROFT: Today, 22 years after Congress took the government out of the airline business, there are more flights, more choices and much lower fares. But there is a price. Flying has become an uncomfortable, unreliable and annoying form of mass transit. And instead of airline commercials that offer fantasies, today`s offer apologies.<br />
<br />TELEVISION COMMERCIAL: I want to apologize personally on behalf of United.<br />
<br />KROFT: We wanted to find out if all of our observations were rooted in fact, so we went to Professor Darrell Jenkins, who heads the Aviation Institute at George Washington University and has worked as a consultant for most of the major airlines.<br />
<br />(on camera): Is that true, or is that just my imagination and other people`s imagination?<br />
<br />DARRELL JENKINS: In June, it was worse than it has ever been in the history of commercial aviation.<br />
<br />KROFT: By what measurement?<br />
<br />JENKINS: Well, delays are up over 40 percent over the previous year, and the previous year had been the worst we`d had in 20 years.<br />
<br />KROFT (voice-over): The official explanation in June was bad weather.<br />
<br />UNIDENTIFIED AIRLINE WORKER: Flight 96? That`s canceled, ma`am.<br />
<br />KROFT: But how can a four-hour thunderstorm in the Midwest create two days of delays? The problem, according to Professor Jenkins, is the aviation system`s inability to deal with any kind of disruption.<br />
<br />JENKINS: This system has no flexibility at all, and any time anything goes wrong in the system, the whole system has to shut down in order to maintain safety.<br />
<br />KROFT: One of the problem is the way the airlines schedule their aircraft. In order to make the most efficient use of their equipment, airlines may schedule a plane to fly from Miami to Chicago, then to Portland and finally Dallas. If it encounters a delay in any one of those places, the whole system is thrown off.<br />
<br />JENKINS: Your planes get out of place and your crews get out of place. So you might have a plane which is four or five stations out of where it`s supposed to be, and this is what causes massive delays in the system.<br />
<br />KROFT: On the night of September 11th, when severe thunderstorms hit Chicago, which is a hub for two major airlines, O`Hare airport became a refugee camp for thousands of stranded passengers. The results rippled through the entire system for days. Chicago aviation commissioner Thomas Walker (ph) says it`s become almost a routine occurrence, several times every month during the summer and winter. So O`Hare now stockpiles emergency supplies for its overnight guests.<br />
<br />(on camera): What have we got in here?<br />
<br />THOMAS WALKER: This is one of those storage areas where we store our cots.<br />
<br />KROFT: This is...<br />
<br />WALKER: This is one of four locations, 2,100 cots.<br />
<br />KROFT: Twenty-one hundred?<br />
<br />WALKER: Twenty-one hundred. And unfortunately, there are times when we have to pull out all 2,100 of them.<br />
<br />KROFT: There are times when 2,100 is not enough?<br />
<br />WALKER: There are times when 2,1000 isn`t enough and we call on the Red Cross and Salvation Army to supplement this.<br />
<br />KROFT: It sounds like disaster relief assistance.<br />
<br />WALKER: And at times, that is -- it approximates that.<br />
<br />KROFT (voice-over): Officially, the Department of Transportation acknowledges that one out of every four flights fails to get you where you want to go when you`re supposed to be there. The flights are either delayed, canceled or diverted to another airport. But most people believe the truth is much worse than that.<br />
<br />JENKINS: On-time reporting really is a fraud, one of the greatest frauds ever perpetrated. It`s interesting. Every time a government does something to regulate and report, the people who are being regulated by that always find ways to bump it around and use it to their purposes.<br />
<br />KROFT: For example, they used to schedule one hour to fly from Washington to New York. Now the schedule says it`s one hour and 19 minutes. That`s not the result of continental drift. The airlines, to improve their on-time record, have simply built the delays into the schedule. If you sit on the runway for 40 minutes, you may be steaming that the flight is delayed. But as long as it left the gate within 15 minutes of its scheduled departure, it`s considered to be on schedule.<br />
<br />(on camera): So if you push back on time, you have an on-time departure...<br />
<br />JENKINS: That`s right.<br />
<br />KROFT: ... even if you spent an hour on the runway.<br />
<br />JENKINS: That is correct.<br />
<br />KROFT (voice-over): The obvious problem is too many passengers, too many planes and not enough gates, not enough runways, not even enough airspace. There are nearly three times as many passengers flying today as there were before deregulation, but the number of gates, runways and new airports has barely increased at all.<br />
<br />(on camera): Did the airlines see this coming?<br />
<br />JENKINS: Everybody`s seen this coming. There have been four or five presidential commissions during the 1990s, all of which warned about this problem happening at this time.<br />
<br />KROFT: Who`s to blame?<br />
<br />JENKINS: Well, everybody.<br />
<br />KROFT: That`s the easy way out.<br />
<br />JENKINS: No, but it`s also the truth.<br />
<br />KROFT (voice-over): In 1997, the National Civil Aviation Review Commission predicted that "rapidly growing demand will bring our nation`s aviation system to gridlock soon after the turn of the century." Lech Stefani (ph) is assistant inspector general for the Department of Transportation.<br />
<br />(on camera): You think we`re at gridlock?<br />
<br />LECH STEFANI: Not yet. We`re right on the margins. We`re real close.<br />
<br />KROFT: What`s your definition of gridlock?<br />
<br />STEFANI: Well, we`re pretty close with one in four flights being affected. When you`re so sure that you no longer can rely on it, that that plane`s going to take off and get you where you want -- I mean, that, in my mind, that would be gridlock.<br />
<br />KROFT: We`re pretty close to that now.<br />
<br />STEFANI: Yes.<br />
<br />KROFT: When are things going to get better?<br />
<br />STEFANI: Don`t know.<br />
<br />KROFT: What about new runways?<br />
<br />STEFANI: The thing is that between `91 and `99, there were only five new runways that opened in the United States.<br />
<br />KROFT: In the entire country?<br />
<br />STEFANI: In the entire country. When you look in the future, there are 15 runways proposed or under construction, but they`re three to seven years away.<br />
<br />KROFT (voice-over): If they`re ever built. Almost all major airports are under the control of regional or local governments. Since nobody wants to live next door to an airport or the extra noise and pollution that comes with new runways, airport expansion projects can be political suicide for politicians. But people want to fly, and the airlines want to sell them tickets, so they schedule more and more flights at popular times into airports they know can`t handle them, which is why you sit on the runway for 45 minutes.<br />
<br />But it`s not just the delays that irritate passengers, it`s the lack of information.<br />
<br />JENKINS: The bad information that you get on flights, the poor ticketing process and procedures that you have to go through on re-routing. Try to make a change to that ticket, particularly if it`s discounted, and you`re in for a nightmare. It seems to take them forever to type things in to make changes to reservation records.<br />
<br />KROFT: We were unable to find a single airline executive willing to talk to us on camera about the problems. One CEO told us if he voiced his complaints about the system, airport managers and flight controllers might single out his airline for retribution by slowing down his operations.<br />
<br />So we went to see John Meenan (ph), senior vice president of the Air Transport Association, which represents 14 major carriers.<br />
<br />(on camera): There are people at the FAA who think part of the problem is the airlines overscheduling flights.<br />
<br />JOHN MEENAN: It shouldn`t come as any surprise that people -- airlines schedule flights when people want to fly. We think that the infrastructure has to take that into account.<br />
<br />KROFT: Do you blame the FAA for the problems?<br />
<br />MEENAN: The fact of the matter is, the air traffic control system today is based on really a 1950s radar-type technology. We basically take airplanes and move them single file across the United States, down a country road, if you will. And the minute bad weather occurs, it blocks that road and we can`t make any progress.<br />
<br />KROFT (voice-over): The FAA does have plans to move to a whole new way of managing air traffic called "free flight." Instead of flying from navigation point to navigation point, one plane behind the other, the way it works now, satellite navigation will allow pilots to plot their own direct routes, making use of much more air space. But it will be years before the system is fully operational.<br />
<br />STEVE BROWN (ph): This is a real-time display. It`s updated very frequently.<br />
<br />KROFT: In the past four years, air traffic has increased at the rate of 16 percent, while the system`s capacity to handle it has grown at only 3 percent. At the FAA`s national command center in Herndon, Virginia, the system administrator, Steve Brown, had no straightforward answers.<br />
<br />(on camera): The increase in capacity is not coming any place close to matching the increase in traffic.<br />
<br />BROWN: Demand for air travel in this country is growing very rapidly.<br />
<br />KROFT: Are you losing ground every year? That`s my question. It`s a yes or no, isn`t it?<br />
<br />BROWN: Well, we`re obviously working hard to build the capacity of the system. We`re not being able to deliver the efficiency of the system that we would like to, and we know that passengers are frustrated with the kinds of delays that they`ve seen in the system over this last summer.<br />
<br />JENKINS: It will get worse before it gets better.<br />
<br />KROFT: It`s going to get worse?<br />
<br />JENKINS: It will get worse.<br />
<br />KROFT: How much worse?<br />
<br />JENKINS: You know, it will get worse up to the point where you no longer can tolerate the pain, all right? And at that point, you will rise up against your local congressional leaders and force them to do something.<br />
<br />KROFT (voice-over): All of which seems cold comfort to frequent flyers like Nashville`s Joe Calloway (ph).<br />
<br />(on camera): In the next 10 years, another 250 million people flying with no real increase in capacity.<br />
<br />JOE CALLOWAY: Well, one of them can have my seat.<br />
<br />(LAUGHTER)<br />
<br />CALLOWAY: I`m going to stay home.<br />
<br />(END VIDEOTAPE)<br />
<br />(COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br />
<br />SAFER: Next Friday, this man, Vicente Fox, will take office as president of Mexico. For most of the last century, the U.S. relationship with Mexico has been something like one between a rich, indulgent family and a poor and wayward cousin, with both maintaining a false veneer of equal partnership. Also for most of this past century, Mexico`s been ruled by a single party, a party ridden with corruption, kickbacks and cronyism, a virtual guarantee that a small, rich oligarchy would maintain the status quo. There were elections, but they were little more than passing the mantle from one ruling party insider to another.<br />
<br />Then came July, 2000, and the impossible happened. Along came a man on horseback with a fistful of promises who, in a free and democratic election, won the race for Mexico`s presidency.<br />
<br />(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br />
<br />(voice-over): The appeal of Vicente Fox seemed to combine the warmth of Ronald Reagan and the bravado of Jesse Ventura. He was governor of his home state of Guanajuato (ph), where he still spends weekends on the family ranch. He`s a farmer and businessman and former head of Coca-Cola for Mexico. He stands six foot, six in the cowboy boots he always wears and his family makes.<br />
<br />(on camera): You`re still wearing the cowboy boots.<br />
<br />VICENTE FOX: Yes, sir, until I die. No doubt.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): This commercial highlighted Fox`s campaign slogan, the word "Ya (ph)," meaning "enough," enough already of the old guard.<br />
<br />(on camera): The party in power was in power for most of the last century, right?<br />
<br />FOX: Yes, 71 years. People that just was up to their neck with the system. When you have a monopoly, it corrupts. It happens in businesses and it happens in politics. And it was corrupt.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): Fox nurtured his image as a macho man. Zorro arrives to free the villagers from the evil landlords. By the way, "Zorro" is Spanish for fox.<br />
<br />DICK MORRIS: Fox certainly understood exactly what he represented to people, and he played up to it.<br />
<br />SAFER: Dick Morris, a former Clinton campaign consultant, helped the Fox campaign.<br />
<br />MORRIS: He sort of played up to being the cowboy and played up to being the big, strong guy that wasn`t afraid of anybody.<br />
<br />SAFER: In taking on the ruling party, Fox took on a legacy of Mexico`s drug lords and their allies, the crooked cops, a potentially dangerous campaign tactic.<br />
<br />MORRIS: This guy, who was under constant death threats, would stand up on a podium, unprotected by security, with 250,000 people thronging around him, no metal detectors, nothing, and if anybody wanted to kill him, there was absolutely nothing that he could do.<br />
<br />SAFER (on-camera): I gather during the campaign, you were advised to wear a bulletproof vest, correct, but you wouldn`t.<br />
<br />FOX: Yes, that`s right.<br />
<br />SAFER: Out of vanity, correct?<br />
<br />FOX: Yeah, you look too -- too fat.<br />
<br />(LAUGHTER)<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): He won the election on his 58th birthday. The Mexican people rallied `round Fox`s vision of a new Mexico they could be proud of, with an honest government and jobs for everyone.<br />
<br />(on camera): There was an almost spontaneous cry went up from the crowd, "Don`t fail us."<br />
<br />FOX: Yes, sir.<br />
<br />SAFER: "Don`t fail us." That`s a pretty damn heavy responsibility.<br />
<br />FOX: Yes. And it`s -- it`s in my mind all day, but I still sleep like a kid because I know the capacity of Mexican people to respond to a challenge.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): And they surely responded to Vicente Fox, who, with swagger, determination and a clean record, convinced people that real democracy was possible in Mexico.<br />
<br />(on camera): The idea of democracy -- is that something totally new to most people?<br />
<br />GUADALUPE LOEZA (ph): Absolutely.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): Guadalupe Loeza, a columnist for the newspaper "La Reforma," says it was way overdue.<br />
<br />LOEZA: We were fed up! That`s the word, fed up. And he appeared, somebody who had so much charisma, somebody who was different, and that`s why he won. I mean, because the timing was perfect.<br />
<br />SAFER: The campaign was bitter and negative. Fox called his opponent, Francisco Labastida (ph), a "short little sissy." Right after the election, in an effort, he says, to bring the country together, he went to Labastida to apologize, and to the outgoing president, Ernesto Zedillo.<br />
<br />(on camera): After it was over, you went out to all the guys you beat, and you said...<br />
<br />FOX: "Forgive me." No president had done that, at least in Mexico. I don`t know where else in the world. And when I make a mistake, I ask for forgiveness.<br />
<br />SAFER: So you didn`t feel that you were saying, "I didn`t really mean it."<br />
<br />FOX: Yes. Well, I meant it.<br />
<br />(LAUGHTER)<br />
<br />SAFER: You asked for forgiveness, but you don`t have any regrets.<br />
<br />FOX: No, I don`t.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): He does have a profound belief in business as a model for government.<br />
<br />FOX: Yes, I`m using many of the tools that are very successful in business, like financial engineering, like planning, like marketing.<br />
<br />SAFER (on-camera): The main purpose of a business is to show a profit.<br />
<br />FOX: Yes, sir.<br />
<br />SAFER: The main purpose of government is...<br />
<br />FOX: To show a profit.<br />
<br />SAFER: Well...<br />
<br />FOX: For people, improving income.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): Fox is from the conservative PAN (ph) party, but his real strength is his willingness to reach out to the best and the brightest in all political parties. He chose a left-wing academic, Professor Jorge Castaneda, to be a key adviser.<br />
<br />(on camera): You`re a liberal, a left-of-center -- I would say well left of center, and you`ve chosen to join with a man from the conservative right. Why?<br />
<br />PROF. JORGE CASTANEDA: Because I thought he was open enough, receptive enough, broad-minded enough to include in his platform, in his working team, people, ideas, policies from across the political spectrum.<br />
<br />SAFER: How do you read the effect on the general population of this victory?<br />
<br />CASTANEDA: Enormous expectations which have to be dealt with and addressed both in not disappointing them, but also in cooling them down a bit. It`s going to take a long time to bring about the changes that people want here, but that`s why he was elected, and he`s very, very sensitive to this.<br />
<br />SAFER: In your campaign, you said you were going to get rid of corruption, you were going to defeat the drug lords, you would help to end poverty. Sounds good in a campaign, but in reality...<br />
<br />FOX: I think that ideas move the world. The commitment is there, and I`m going to work hard to make it come through.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): Vicente Fox takes office next month, but already people are wondering just how much can he deliver on all his promises, promises like bringing Mexico`s standard of living closer to Mexico`s NAFTA partners, the U.S. and Canada. With almost half the population below the poverty line, that seems like pie in the sky.<br />
<br />(on camera): He says he`s going to take this country and make it an equal partner with the other two North American countries.<br />
<br />LOEZA: Oh, can you imagine? Oh, no! This is fantasy. You know, fantasy is like Disneyland. No, no. Come on.<br />
<br />SAFER: Does he believe he can?<br />
<br />LOEZA: Yes. That`s the problem!<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): But he also had the fantasy that he could be president. To add to the unlikeliness of that, he`s divorced, a major negative in this conservative Catholic country. And he has custody of his four adopted children.<br />
<br />(on camera): What were your kids` reaction to your victory?<br />
<br />FOX: Fear, maybe a little bit of sadness, seeing Papa now committed with a whole country, and that means less time for them, maybe less attention, less love.<br />
<br />SAFER: You are said to be Mexico`s most eligible bachelor. Are you being deluged with proposals from attractive women?<br />
<br />FOX: Well, I have 52 million girlfriends in Mexico, 52 million women that are desperate to participate, and they`re demanding opportunities.<br />
<br />SAFER: I understand that, but I`m talking about your private life.<br />
<br />(LAUGHTER)<br />
<br />FOX: Next program.<br />
<br />SAFER: You said that the reason he won`t remarry is he`s already too much in love with himself.<br />
<br />LOEZA: Yes! Everybody is saying he`s so wonderful, so handsome, so intelligent. He`s started to believe it seriously.<br />
<br />SAFER: It is said that power corrupts.<br />
<br />LOEZA: Yes.<br />
<br />SAFER: So do you think he is susceptible to the kind of corruption that has been endemic in Mexico for...<br />
<br />LOEZA: No, in that sense, I`m quite confident. I think he`s a very honest man.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): In fact, Fox has promised to get rid of the rampant corruption that`s become almost a way of life in law enforcement and in government.<br />
<br />FOX: It became a culture and a behavior. And so we have to change that culture. And I know that people change, and I trust that people will change now. But we have to force them.<br />
<br />CASTANEDA: He has to create a truth commission to investigate corruption in the past and settle scores with the past, without witch hunts, but going after people who are thought to be or who were corrupt. This has to be done, and it has to be done quickly.<br />
<br />SAFER: To crack down on the drug lords, Fox says he`ll need help from the United States, the ultimate market for virtually all the drugs that flow through Mexico. He recently visited the White House, where drugs were high on the agenda.<br />
<br />(on camera): In this area of drugs, do you think that the United States may be just as corrupt as the producer?<br />
<br />FOX: How else can you explain...<br />
<br />(CROSSTALK)<br />
<br />SAFER: ... transporting countries.<br />
<br />FOX: How can you explain those tons and tons and tons of drugs coming into the United States? We`re smart. We Mexicans are smart, but not that smart to be able to smuggle those tons by ourselves. So there must be also some corruption within the United States. The billions and billions of dollars generated by drug consumption comes from the United States. And those billions of dollars are used to bribe Mexican officials or Mexican policemen. So let`s face that we have a problem, that each one of us has it, and let`s meet it together.<br />
<br />SAFER: What`s he going to be like for the U.S. to deal with?<br />
<br />MORRIS: He`s going to be a challenge for the United States. He`s not going to be a puppet. He`s not going to be paid off. He`s not going to lay down. And I think that he`s going to be much more in the nature of an equal partner and much less of a sycophant.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): Fox`s vision of a Mexico more equal to the United States includes a free flow of trade between the two countries, and eventually, a free flow of people. That would mean that the immigrants sneaking across the border would be able to come to the U.S. legally.<br />
<br />(on camera): One of the most, I guess, inflammatory things that you`ve said to many Americans is open borders.<br />
<br />FOX: Yes.<br />
<br />SAFER: That scares a lot of Americans, this flood of poor people coming into the United States.<br />
<br />FOX: Yeah, I can see that, Americans sitting, watching the TV and hearing Vicente Fox saying this. But ideas, again, move the world.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): He claims the American economy needs Mexican help, literally, people to do the jobs Americans won`t do.<br />
<br />FOX: You will need good runners (ph), good people working on many activities. You need -- the United States cannot grow at rates of 4 or 5 percent if you don`t bring in people, and you know you need them.<br />
<br />SAFER (on-camera): A lot of Americans do want good gardeners, but they want them to be illegal so they don`t have to pay them a living wage, correct?<br />
<br />FOX: And that`s corruption. That`s corruption also.<br />
<br />SAFER (voice-over): With expectations now running so high, Fox himself faces enormous challenges. He only has a few years to turn the country around. Presidents are elected for a single six-year term. But Fox is confident that his legacy when he leaves office will be a different Mexico than the one we know.<br />
<br />FOX: The 20th century was the century of North America, of Asia, of Europe. Now is the time for Latin America. We have a new attitude. We have democracies now. We know that we either educate or we won`t have development and growth. And Mexico will be the winner of the 21st century. You will notice that when you come back six years from now. You will see that.<br />
<br />(END VIDEOTAPE)<br />
<br />(COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br />
<br />RATHER: I`m Dan Rather in CBS News election headquarters with an update on the presidential election and what`s happened tonight. George Bush was declared the winner tonight of Florida`s potentially decisive 25 electoral votes. He was declared that by the Republican secretary of state. But there are many legal challenges to come, and this battle for the White House, it may turn out, is a long way from being over yet.<br />
<br />Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman immediately called the vote count, and I quote him, "inaccurate and incomplete," unquote. That vote count, as put forward by the secretary of state, indicates the Bush-Cheney ticket defeated Gore-Lieberman in Florida by 537 votes. The official certification was made a short time ago by the Florida secretary of state, Republican Katherine Harris.<br />
<br />(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br />
<br />HARRIS: ... in the presidential race in Florida is as follows. Governor George W. Bush, 2,912,790. Vice President Al Gore, 2,912,253. Accordingly -- accordingly, on behalf of the state elections canvassing commission and in accordance with the laws of the state of Florida, I hereby declare Governor George W. Bush the winner of Florida`s 25 electoral votes for the president for the United States.<br />
<br />(END VIDEO CLIP)<br />
<br />RATHER: Now, the campaign of Vice President Al Gore was quick to say that the certification of the vote would not stand and could not stand because all the votes, in effect, have not yet been counted. That is their position.<br />
<br />We go now to CBS`s John Roberts at the White House.<br />
<br />John?<br />
<br />JOHN ROBERTS, CBS NEWS: Dan, the vice president remains resolute in his belief tonight that he got more votes in Florida than Governor Bush did, and that when all of his votes are counted -- and he thinks they will be -- that he will emerge the winner. Tonight his running mate, Senator Joseph Lieberman, denounced the secretary of state`s actions in the strongest terms.<br />
<br />(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br />
<br />Sen. JOE LIEBERMAN (D-CT), VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: This evening, the secretary of state of Florida has decided to certify what by any reasonable standard is an incomplete and inaccurate count of the votes cast in the state of Florida.<br />
<br />(END VIDEO CLIP)<br />
<br />ROBERTS: Senator Lieberman said that because of that, he and the vice president now have no choice but to contest the election. In fact, their legal team came out earlier today and said that they would file contests of election in three Florida counties -- Miami-Dade, Palm Beach County and another one in Nassau County.<br />
<br />But Senator Lieberman was quick to come out tonight in an attempt to blunt any appearance of a Bush victory by declaring that the election was being certified under protest. The vice president will also make that point tomorrow, when he addresses the nation at about noon to explain why, instead of conceding, he is going to continue with his court battle.<br />
<br />But it is clear tonight that from a public perception standpoint, at least, the vice president is now at a distinct deficit.<br />
<br />Dan?<br />
<br />RATHER: John Roberts.<br />
<br />Note that the Bush forces have indicated that Governor Bush will be speaking some time later tonight.<br />
<br />We go now to Austin, Texas, and CBS News correspondent Bill Whitaker.<br />
<br />Bill?<br />
<br />BILL WHITAKER, CBS NEWS: Dan, this is the outcome the Bush campaign had expected, or more accurately, had hoped and prayed for. Now, Governor Bush is expected to make a comment later this evening, but he has said all along that he won Florida fair and square, that he played by the rules and that he won recount after recount.<br />
<br />Now, just moments ago, his representative in Tallahassee, James Baker, said that it`s now time for the vice president to accept defeat and stop the fight.<br />
<br />(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br />
<br />JAMES BAKER, OBSERVER FOR BUSH CAMPAIGN: Ladies and gentlemen, at some point -- at some point -- there must be closure. At some point, the law much prevail and the lawyers must go home. We have reached that point.<br />
<br />(END VIDEO CLIP)<br />
<br />WHITAKER: Now, the campaign sees this certification as a watershed. They believe that Vice President Al Gore`s fight just got significantly harder, and one campaign aide said to me tonight that if Vice President Al Gore keeps pressing his fight now, he will just seem desperate and will quickly lose the patience and the sympathy of the public.<br />
<br />Dan?<br />
<br />RATHER: Bill Whitaker.<br />
<br />Joining us now, our CBS News consultant on constitutional law, Professor Jonathan Turley.<br />
<br />Jonathan, the secretary of state certified the Florida vote. What does that mean, with all the pending court challenges? Where are we now? Where does this lead us?<br />
<br />JONATHAN TURLEY, GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY: Well, Dan, it`s more of a starting line than a finish line, really. We`re now entering the period called the contest period under federal law -- I`m sorry, Florida law. And what`ll happen now is each of these men are going to try to capture small groups of votes -- in some cases, in one county, 51 votes, and another county could be thousands. But they`re going to try to grab as many of those votes or defeat as many votes of the opponent as they can. All of this is going to occur in the backdrop of the Supreme Court. But they can`t rely upon a decision of the Supreme Court. They`ve got to grab or defeat as many votes as they can in the next week.<br />
<br />RATHER: Jonathan Turley, thanks.<br />
<br />This battle for the White House is being fought on a number of fronts, two of them being legal and political. For the latest on the political, we turn to Bob Schieffer, our CBS News chief Washington correspondent.<br />
<br />Bob?<br />
<br />BOB SCHIEFFER, CBS NEWS: Well, Dan, I think one of the most interesting things that James Baker said tonight when he came out and briefed the press, he said "It is time to let the process of the transition begin." Now, what does he mean by that? Is Governor Bush going to come out a little later tonight -- we`re told he`s going to speak. Will he declare himself to be president? How far will he go in saying "Let this process of transition begin?"<br />
<br />As you know, the federal government leases a large group of offices here in Washington for the president-elect`s transition team. Will the Bush team now ask for the keys to those transition offices? Will this administration turn over the keys? Will that send off another round of lawsuits? This is the sort of thing that normally does not happen during our elections in America. The losers leave, and the winners move in. That`s not the case. That`s not what we`re seeing tonight. I think we`re moving into totally new, uncharted, and I hesitate to use the word, but perhaps dangerous territory.<br />
<br />RATHER: Bob Schieffer.<br />
<br />There`ll be more about this as the evening goes along on this CBS station. And we now break for a commercial.<br />
<br />(COMMERCIAL BREAK)<br />
<br />STAHL: Until someone decides who our next president`s going to be, Andy`s decided to get out of politics and go into electronics.<br />
<br />(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)<br />
<br />ANDY ROONEY, CBS NEWS: Inventors are inventing new things before most of use learn how to use the last thing they invented. This year they`re making computers 10 times faster than last year. They`re producing digital television sets before some of us have learned how to work everything on the set we have now. When are the inventors going to get practical and do something about the tangle of wires we all have running these devices they invented?<br />
<br />Look at this mess around my desk here. Look behind the television set in your living room, under the bed, behind the refrigerator. Chances are, it`s a rat`s nest of electrical cords. Those cables over my head here are for the lights when I do something on camera like this in my office.<br />
<br />Here, let me show you something over here. These are all cords for pieces of equipment I bought in the last 10 years. Look at this, all different. Nothing works with anything else. Look at the endings on them, no two the same. I don`t even know what most of them are for anymore, but I don`t dare throw them away because I might need them. I mean, if Thomas Edison was so smart, how come he didn`t make one cord that fits everything?<br />
<br />Inventors have come up with more ways to turn lights on and off than we need. Here`s a fairly typical New York apartment. You walk in, flip a switch in the hall, and a light comes on. Do you do the same thing to get light in the kitchen? You do not. For light to read by sitting on the couch in the living room, you turn a little paddle switch. For the lamp over here, the switch is not on the lamp at all, it`s on the cord, which usually falls behind the table.<br />
<br />In the bedroom, you don`t turn a switch on or press anything. You turn this knurled knob. You push a little knob that goes in and out to get light out of this. And for this you pull a chain.<br />
<br />We all dislike uniformity, but there are times when sameness pays off. For instance, we all agree to drive on the same side of the road. It`s safer that way. We ought to get together so we have one wire for everything and one way to start and stop the power from flowing through it.<br />
