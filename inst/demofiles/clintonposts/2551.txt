<p>The car is totalled, after all.&nbsp; A week after my birthday (two weeks and one day after the accident), my insurance adjuster (one of my <em>three </em>insurance adjusters, actually - I can't complain about the service from my gecko mascoted company) called to give me the news.&nbsp; Although their original estimate had included work to repair all of the damage done to the outside of the car, it apparently took them a week to get around to looking underneath the car.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&quot;The underside of your car is...well, it's pretty mangled,&quot; he told me.&nbsp; &quot;I'm sorry to tell you it's now a total loss.&nbsp; It seems clear now that the other driver's car drove right up underneath yours.&nbsp; It destroyed the gas tank, the frame rails...&quot;.&nbsp; He told me some other things that it destroyed, but I don't remember exactly what they were.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I felt a little bit of a catch in my throat, wondering, if he drove underneath us, how close we had come to flipping over or onto our side.</p>

<p>The Honda CR-V is a good car, we've decided, and we're looking to replace it with as near an identical version as possible.&nbsp; This will make Katie happy, I think - she asks about &quot;New Car&quot; every day.&nbsp; &quot;New Car broken,&quot; she'll tell me, seemingly out of nowhere.&nbsp; &quot;Want to see new car.&quot;&nbsp; &quot;I need to see new car right now.&quot; &quot;Big bump hit New Car.&nbsp; Mommy say 'crap.'&quot;&nbsp; I laughed when she first told me this, but I have to admit I'm pretty impressed with myself, if &quot;crap&quot; is the worst I said in the midst of the accident.&nbsp; (This will be an entry for another time, but our daughter, if I do say so myself, is amazingly verbal for someone still not 2.5 years old.)</p>

<p>Not only did the car keep us safe, but we're actually walking away from all of this with a little bit of money.&nbsp; The car's blue book value is about $2500 more than we paid for it.&nbsp; We joke about what a great money-making scheme this was, to buy the car after negotiating the price down, then total it 3 months later, to walk away with the extra money.&nbsp; That's how we are, I guess - far enough away from the terror of it that we can joke about things like that.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The bigger but less concrete news is that we might have an opportunity to move across the country.&nbsp; The same day of the accident, somewhere around 5 hours before we were rear-ended, Geoff had called me from his conference in Southern Illinois.&nbsp; &quot;Do you want to move to New York?&quot; he asked, with no real explanation, and I thought he was joking.&nbsp; &quot;Are you serious?&quot; I asked.</p>

<p>It turns out he was serious.&nbsp; There was a minister of music from a church in Westchester County, New York who was at the conference with Geoff.&nbsp; He encouraged Geoff to apply for the job, and then later that day, with my blessing (sure, you should apply; if we don't want to move, we won't - if we do, we will), Geoff told him that he was going to apply.&nbsp; &quot;Good,&quot; Paul said.&nbsp; &quot;I already told the church to put you on the short list.&quot;</p>

<p>Geoff put together a resume and called references, and last Sunday Paul called.&nbsp; They wanted to interview Geoff sometime soon, in the next week or two, and that they would fly him out.&nbsp; &quot;Jessie wants to come, too,&quot; Geoff told Paul, and &quot;Oh, of course, we wouldn't want you to come without her,&quot; Paul said.&nbsp; </p>

<p>The job pays well, for a church job, but probably not enough to live in Westchester County, New York.&nbsp; (I did not know this, but we've been googling things, and it's apparently a wealthy area.&nbsp; That's probably an understatement.&nbsp; According to wikipedia, the County is home to Martha Stewart, Bill &amp; Hillary Clinton, David Letterman, and Ralph Lauren.)&nbsp; What made us decide that it would be worth applying, though, is that not only does this full-time job pay twice what Geoff's current part-time church job pays, but also it comes with free housing.&nbsp; And free day care.&nbsp; It seems like an opportunity we'd be foolish not to investigate. </p>

<p>If we do move, I think it would happen this fall.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Everything feels up in the air right now, full of possibility and anxiety and relief, all at the same time - the accident, our survival, the possible new job, the old car, the new car, a possible big move to a brand new place.&nbsp; What would happen with my job?&nbsp; A question we'd have to find an answer to.&nbsp; What about our condo?&nbsp; What will the included housing be <em>like</em>?&nbsp; And mixed up in there with everything else, we have been trying to have another baby since the beginning of the year, too, and so there is also that possibility, hanging in the air.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It would be just like the universe to bring us all of this at once, wouldn't it?&nbsp; </p></div>
