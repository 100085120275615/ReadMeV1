<div>I'd like to try to guage what Virginia Democrats (or any kind of Democrats) think about different 2008 presidential candidates. This is not whether you would vote for them in the general election over the Republican, but rather in the primaries. You can answer yes to as many as you want, even if you don't <em>intend</em> to vote for them, just if you <em>would</em> (follow me?). So, after I list these folks, copy-paste them to the comments section with a yes, no, or maybe beside their name (if you've never heard of them, put "say who?" or something like that), and then any amout of explaination you may want to give. I'll do a "reporting" post on it in a day or two.<br />
<br />I've went ahead and put my preliminary answers down.<br />
<br />John Kerry - Yes<br />Hillary Clinton - No<br />Mark Warner - Yes<br />Joe Biden - Yes<br />Tom Vilsack - Maybe<br />John Edwards -Yes<br />Wesley Clark - Yes<br />Evan Bayh - Maybe<br />Chris Dodd - Yes<br />Russ Feingold - No<br />Bill Richardson - Maybe<br />Mike Gravel - No<br />Ben Nelson - No<br />Tom Daschle - Maybe<br />Dennis Kucinich - Maybe<br />
