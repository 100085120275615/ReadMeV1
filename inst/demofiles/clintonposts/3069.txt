<div>From <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/editorial/view.bg?articleid=150983&srvc=home">his column</a> "Israelâs overkill enabled by immoral U.S. policy" in the Boston Herald: <blockquote>âOne who goes to sleep with rockets shouldnât be surprised if he doesnât wake up in the morning,â said Israelâs ambassador to the United Nations, Dan Gillerman.<br />
<br />Today, we hear unctuous statements about how Israel takes pains to avoid civilian casualties, drops leaflets to warn civilians to flee target areas and conforms to all the rules of civilized warfare. But Israelâs words and deeds contradict her propaganda.<br /> <br />Gillerman, at a pro-Israel rally in New York, thundered, âTo those countries who claim that we are using disproportionate force, I have only this to say: Youâre damn right we are.â</blockquote>Buchanan aims much of the blame right back at U.S. politicians of both parties.<blockquote>And how does one defend our behavior?<br />
<br />When Gillerman was exulting in the disproportionality of Israelâs attack on Lebanon, U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton was smiling smugly beside him. When the U.N. Security Council tabled a resolution condemning Hezbollahâs igniting of the war, but also the excesses of Israelâs reprisals, U.S. Ambassador John Bolton vetoed it. When a few congressmen sought to moderate a pro-Israeli resolution by adding words urging âall sides to protect innocent life and infrastructure,â GOP leader John Boehner ordered the words taken down.<br />
<br />America shares full moral and political responsibility for the massacre at Qana.</blockquote> Clearly the Bush administration has its own agenda in the Middle East and is egging Israel on to carry out the attacks on Lebanon. That doesn't mean Congress has to go along with it, or the American people.<br />
<br />And we shouldn't have to rely on Pat Buchanan, of all people, to remind us that the collective punishment being carried out against the nation of Lebanon is as immoral as it is stupid.</div>
