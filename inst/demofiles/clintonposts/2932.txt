<br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br />
<br />CLINTON CONTINUES TO AVOID DISCUSSION OF THE WAR.<br />
<br />NEW YORK, NY â Yesterday Senator Clinton and Ned Lamont met at Clintonâs estate in Chappaqua. Although the two spoke for ninety minutes, the war in Iraq was not a topic of discussion. âHow can Clinton continue to avoid discussion about her position on the Iraq war?â questioned Tasini.<br />
<br />âHer refusal to debate is disrespectful not only to New York voters but to the democratic process.âAccording to the most recent Marist poll, 68% of Democrats believe that the Iraq war should be a major campaign issue this fall, and 64% say they would vote for an anti-war candidate.<br />
<br />On Monday, Tasini will hold a press conference with families of soldiers in Iraq to call on Senator Clinton to agree to a debate about the Iraq war. The press conference will take place at 11:00am on the steps of City Hall.</div>
