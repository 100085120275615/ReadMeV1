<br />I was going to start this posting with "Is it just me? Or do the bat-shit crazy antics of this administration just keep getting battier and battier?", but then I realized that of course it is not just me.<br />
<br />Rummy faced a senate committee yesterday and Hillary Clinton lambasted him about the stupidly inaccurate predictions made every step of the way and wondered why anyone should believe him now. His response? "Oh my goodness" followed by another spouting of the tired old "Whoda thunk" company line that we have seen trotted out for every major screw-up from 9-11 to the deficit to Katrina to the war. His generals did admit the possibility of civil war for the first time. Oh my goodness indeed.<br />
<br />And it turns out the FDA had already decided against approving the Plan B morning-after contraceptive pills before their scientists finished their review. We are not surprised since this administration views science and those who practice it like fundamentalist Christians view witch doctors. Or rather, the hard core of the administration's voters view science that way and the administration caters to their every whim. Of course some of that may also be a knee-jerk reaction from oil men towards the global warming warners. They just want to listen to those who they support and who support them with fake-science. (Commonly referred to here as industry scientists. You know, like the tobacco scientists who denied any link between illness and smoking.)<br />
<br />And it looks like the President is submitting a bill that would essentially do away with any protections you have under the Constitution and Bill of Rights. Apparently big government is bad when it regulates business, bad when it taxes rich people, ok when it taxes poor people, and great when it wants to tell people what to do with their bodies, in their homes, or stamps out any opposition as being traitorous. Providing of course that it is a Republican administration in power.</div>
