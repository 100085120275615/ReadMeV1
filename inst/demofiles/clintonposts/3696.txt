<div>U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Michael Chertoff from the Third Circuit is the new nominee to serve as Secretary to the Department of Homeland Security. His bio can be found <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/olp/chertoffresume.htm">here</a>. His was one of the swiftest confirmations I've seen from appellate judges in recent years, with his nomination coming March 5, 2003, his confirmation hearing held a month later on April 7, and his confirmation on June 9 of that year. His one "no" vote, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, appeared today to suggest she would be able to support Chertoff's nomination for Homeland Security.

<a href="http://www.wonkette.com/politics/hill/chertoff-nominated-for-homeland-security-029435.php">Wonkette wrote</a> that Bush's nomination speech statement that Chertoff "has shown a deep commitment to the cause of justice and an unwavering determination to protect the American people" translated to "Fuck you, Hillary."
<br />
<br />Well, despite Howard <a href="http://www.legalaffairs.org/howappealing/2005_01_01_appellateblog_archive.html#110548126348329554">Bashman's post</a>, which simply announces that Sen. Clinton had voted against Chertoff for the Court of Appeals spot as an explanation, it's also important to look at that bio and note that Chertoff was the Senate Republican Counsel to the Whitewater Committee. 
<br />
<br />As late as September 2000 (as Hillary was seeking the New York Senate seat), Chertoff was on <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/whitewater/july-dec00/whitewater2.html">talk shows</a> gabbing about how "there were serious questions about the conduct of the governor and the then-first lady of Arkansas in their dealing with this fraudulent savings and loan and the subsequent investigations thereafter."
<br />
<br />In other words, there's more there there than Bashman's vote note would imply.</div>
