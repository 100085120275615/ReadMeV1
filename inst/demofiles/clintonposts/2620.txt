I have watched the latest John Spencer campaign commercial so many times during the past 24 hours, I am now sick of it. The reason I have watched it was because of the media onslaught that says the commercial compares Hillary Clinton to Osama Bin Laden.</p>

<p>Can someone explain to me where in that commercial Spencer does that? </p>

<p>I can't find it. But it has made some conservative bloggers <a href="http://politicalvindication.blogspot.com/2006/08/hillary-osama.html">go a little batty</a>. </p>

<p>The commercial speaks of a perceived weakness of Clinton when it comes to the tools the government is using to fight Islamic fascist terrorists. It raises the specter that Spencer would be tougher in implementing laws that give the government tools to fight terrorism.</p>

<p>Nowhere in the commercial does it compare Hillary to Bin Laden. If it did, I would have blasted the Spencer campaign like I have done in the past in this campaign when I felt they stepped over the line.</p>

<p>People seem to be upset that there is a picture of Bin Laden and Hillary on the same screen during the commercial. That isn't a comparison. The commercial questions Hillary's national security focus. There is no comparison between the former First Lady and current New York Senator with that bastard hiding out in a cave. I would even venture a guess that Hillary Clinton hates Osama Bin Laden as much as nearly every single American. Or even as a New Yorker, I could see Clinton hoping to one day be in a room with Bin Laden while he's handcuffed and she has a Derek Jeter special in her hands.</p>

<p>But the commercial doesn't compare the two. This is a faulty argument. </p>

<p>People can hate the commercial --- even conservatives could dislike it. But to say it unfairly compares the two, that's just wrong.</p><p>Where Spencer does come close to the line is over Hillary's record on the Patriot Act. </p>

<p>She did support it the first time it was enacted, just like nearly every other Democrat and Republican in Congress. When it came to its reimplementation, Clinton and many Democrats and certain Republicans complained that it was infringing on the rights of Americans. While I disagree with those, including Hillary, who made this argument, the Act was eventually changed to ease the concerns those in the opposition to reimplementing the law.</p>

<p>Clinton also voted against ending a filibuster to bring the Patriot Act to the floor prior to the changes being made. Does this mean she was against the Patriot Act? Yes, she was opposed to the Act she first voted for. But that wasn't a John Kerry moment for Clinton: she had concerns whether rights of Americans were being infringed.</p>

<p>This is the point where Spencer dances --- but he isn't wrong in what his commercial said.</p>

<p>As I wrote yesterday, national security is a politicized issue. Both Republicans and Democrats (regardless of their bluster that they aren't making it an issue) have politicized it. The problem is that the mainstream media only focuses on the Republicans and they give the Democrats a pass. </p></div>
