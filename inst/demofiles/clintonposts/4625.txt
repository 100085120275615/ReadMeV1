<p>It&#8217;s been 10 years since President Clinton and GOP-led Congress reformed our nation&#8217;s welfare programs.  Villified and praised at the time, there are bunch of &#8220;welfare reform at 10&#8243; stories and forums (like <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Press/Events/ev081706b.cfm" target="_blank">this one</a>) out there discussing a radical change to how our nation assists poor families.  Worth a read for those interested in how our national policy affects the poorest among us.</p>
<p>Excerpt from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/washington/21welfare.html">NYT Times story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When the 1996 law was passed, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/d/democratic_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Democratic Party">Democrats</a> like Senator <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/daniel_patrick_moynihan/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Daniel Patrick Moynihan.">Daniel Patrick Moynihan</a>, liberal advocacy groups like the Childrenâs Defense Fund and liberal academics predicted that it would increase child poverty, hunger and homelessness. The predictions were not fulfilled.</p>
<p>But Republican hopes have not been completely realized either. While single mothers are more likely to work, many remain in poverty.</p>
<p>The 1996 law did not become a template for changes in other programs, nor did it portend a major ideological shift to the right. President Bushâs efforts to curb the growth of larger entitlement programs and to create an âownership societyâ have faltered. Congress authorized health savings accounts but rebuffed proposals for a nationwide program of school vouchers. Mr. Bushâs campaign to overhaul Social Security, with the creation of personal retirement accounts, ended in a political fiasco for him and his party.</p>
<p>The law has largely neutralized welfare as a political issue. Welfare mothers are seen in a more favorable light now that most are required to work. Welfare has become âmore supportable and acceptable, more defensible,â said Professor Nathan, a moderate Republican who served as a welfare official in the Nixon administration.</p>
<p>Democrats and Republicans fight over important details, like the amount of money available for child care or the number of hours that must be worked by welfare recipients. But hardly anyone advocates a return to the old system.</p></blockquote>
