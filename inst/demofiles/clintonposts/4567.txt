<p>I think I always liked Adeel for some peculiar reason even though I don&#8217;t much see him. The following joke/email that he sent me this morning could be one of the reasons hehe.</p>
<p>Three women wanted to cross a river. They had no idea how to cross it, so one woman knelt down on her knees and prayed &#8220;Lord give me the power and strength to cross the river.&#8221; suddenly the woman became very strong and swam across the river. </p>
<p>The next woman thought: if it worked for her, it&#8217;ll work for me. So she knelt down and prayed &#8220;Lord give the skills and the strength to cross the river.&#8221; the woman built a canoe and rowed herself across the river. </p>
<p>The last woman thought: if it worke! d for both of them, I know it&#8217;ll work for me. So she also knelt down and prayed &#8220;Lord give me the wisdom and knowledge to cross the river.&#8221; She turned into a man and walked across the bridge!!</p>
<p>And for Fadi and other loosers who didn&#8217;t want to send me the songs, I just got to visit this cafe which is WorldCall powered and found almost all of the songs <a href="to-listen-list/">I wanted</a>. Here&#8217;s something to show &#8216;em off <img src="http://ej.eomag.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /><br />
