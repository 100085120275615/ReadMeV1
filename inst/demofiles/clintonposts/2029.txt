<span>Playing to peopleâs fears is as easy as making a baby cry, because you donât have to deliver anything to keep that fear alive and insidiously eating away at people. All successful dictators and schoolyard bullies employ this tactic.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Playing to peopleâs hopes is impossible for these kind of motherfuckers because you have to actually deliver on those hopes and that's not within their skill sets or DNA.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>You have to actually make something better, improve people's lives, make for a better future to gain the people's continued confidence or loyalty. Itâs hard work, damn it. Hard work indeed.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>And it is just too goddamn hard for the gang in charge - who I will remind you were headed straight into the one-and-done crapper just nine months after they took office. Many who drank the Kool Aid no longer remember that, since as testing has now proved, the part of their brains that controls self-choice and courage was destroyed (along with their bladder control).</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Once we get them all into the re-education camps we'll remind them that up until September 11, 2001 Bush and Company had already proven that the majority of American voters who cast their ballots for Al Gore were right.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Funny how getting caught with their cowboy chaps down, having already fucked up the FBI and American intelligence capabilities, turned out so good for them. And all because they discovered the power of panic.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Until the day they got scared shitless personally that someone was out to kill THEM, and recognizing how strong that emotion was, projected that fear onto every American in every town in every state from the North to the South to the East to the West.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>To listen to them not a single citizen in this nation of almost 300 million people was safe. We all had to be ready to be attacked at any second. Damn it man we were at code yellow! No, today it's code Orange! Maybe today's the day we go to Red Alert! God help us all! That's even worse than DefCom 4, isn't it? Worse than mutually assured destruction.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Worse than a ragtag band of dissenters in the 1770s giving the colonial finger to the most powerful government on the face of the planet and telling them they'd fight to the death before they'd bow down to assholes who wanted to curtail their rights and freedom.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The most yellow-bellied, bedwetting cowards to ever hold political office - and I'm including Richard Nixon, LBJ and Joe McCarthy - are George Bush, Dick Cheney and their brotherhood of fellow clucking like chicken, frightened little rabbits who are the best friends and allies Osama Bin Laden could ever have made.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Let me tell you exactly what I would have done as President and what Al Gore would have done as President.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>We would have quickly captured Osama Bin Laden and all his key people. We would have put them on public trial and then executed them. At the same time we were doing that we would have sent our special forces and best suited military units to hunt down and kill every single member of Al Qaeda in Pakistan, Saudi Arabia Yemen and everywhere else they existed.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>And we wouldn't call that a war, we wouldn't play make believe costume wearing, "war time President," and we wouldn't insult over two centuries of brave Americans who stood up for our country when their time came by making believe that Al Qaeda was some kind of super enemy who we could not defeat or who we should be scared of.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>We would have treated 9-11 seriously and made the people who caused it pay such a terrible price that others would think twice before trying anything like that again.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I know Al Gore was capable of it because he had already proved how intelligent he was and how far ahead of the curve he was on global warming and the need for alternative energy. While dickless wonders made fun of him about the Internet and science, Al Gore was remembering the time he spent in Vietnam wearing a military uniform - something most of his Republican contemporaries were too scared and cowardly to do.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>But as you know that's not what pussies George Bush and Dick Cheney - both of whom were too gutless and too scared as young American men to fight against the Communists in Viet Nam when they had the chance - did with 9-11. Nope these pantywaists, along with fellow known chickenhawks Tom Delay, Bill Frist, Denny Hassert, George Allen and every single other Republican holding national office set new standards of shameless cowardice. Instead of standing up to the real enemy, they stood on top of the bodies of the 2977 dead Americans and turned into the enemy themselves.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>And almost every single Democrat enabled them and rolled over like a happy dog in a field full of feces. And that made them cowards of the same ilk.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>You can excuse Russ Feingold, maybe Senator Byrd, Tom Harkin. Maybe a few others... but you cannot excuse the others who still today are cowered and forever paralyzed by the fear that 9-11 instilled in them.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>And what has been the result of all these spineless, submissive, lily-livered punks selling out Americaâs soul so that they might feel safer in their puddles of power?</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>1. The media has become completely emasculated with the brief exception of the Katrina coverage, which even these pusillanimous pussies couldn't ignore since it was happening to THEM too and for once they told the truth. A media that allows the rules of embedding is worthless. That's what happens when the media is owned by cowardly corporations like Fox News Corp, Time Warner, GE, Viacom and others known for being the models of the lowest common demoninator.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>2. The United States education system is to learning what Ford and GM are to cars. Cowardly, mostly burnt out teachers and professors toe the government and Christian line, too afraid to speak out or offer an informed point of view since they start out with contempt for their dumbed down students from the first day of school. They project their own shame over failed dreams into their daily curriculum and churn out the next generation of clone-like sheep. Tell us some more about Intelligent Design professor...Tell us why you hide in the classroom counting the minutes till your pensions?</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>3. Cowards have tried to turn the word "environmentalist" into a dirty word to cover up their fear that the truth will come out and they will be torn apart, limb by limb, by angry young people who realize they were raped. How weak and afraid do you have to be to hide from the reality of global warming? Are there any bigger sell-outs on the planet than those who champion the oil industry in the 21st century? How big a simpering weakling do you have to be to sell off our forests and protected lands to those who wish to destroy them forever in the name of profit? America may be addicted to oil, but Bush and Cheney are the junkies stealing from your grandmother to pay for their habit.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>4. We now suffer under the worst government ever bought and paid for. John McCain pretends to be brave on the issue of campaign reform, but for all the effectiveness he's had, he might have well have stayed a POW because he is MIA when it comes to real guts on this issue. It's all just coward cover for a man who isn't about to do anything except use the issue to raise more money. McCain talks a lot, but he's just as big a coward on changing the corruption that he himself is part of. McCain has sold out to the people he takes bribes from just like every single member of Congress has. A brave person would stand up and say our system is corrupt and to fix it we have to end all campaign contributions and lobby money. Period. But McCain ain't that guy. He's the guy that let Bush kick his ass and then went back for more because he liked it so much. I say he's nothing but a professional victim. Go ahead and argue with me you cowards, while you continue to raise record amounts.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>5. Only punks and cowards would treat the poor, the sick, the hungry, the uneducated, and the homeless the way the United States of America does today. The most shameful cowards of all fear that helping those who are worst off among us somehow lessons their own chances of success. The biggest argument against national healthcare is fear.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>6. Only a nation of bitch-slapped prison wives would roll over on the laws, constitution and rights this republic was founded on the way the USA today has. The Supreme Court has been turned into a panel of crooked judges on the the take and today's attorney general represents only the coverup of illegal activities and no longer represents the citizens of the United States. Where did he get his model? The Godfather? The work he's doing has to have Osama Bin Laden dancing a jihad jig. Why blow up anything else in America when it's already being done as an inside job? No terrorist could do a better job destroying the American way of life or our values. The patriot act reads like something only our REAL enemies wish on us.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>7. How chickenshit do you have to be to still suck on the tit of the oil industry the way Dick and Bush do? Where are the balls that set us on the same path it took to land a man on the moon in less than 10 years?</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>8. The biggest disgraces in world history misued the military and turned the people in uniform into their own personal vigilantes. Nothing could be more cowardly than to have refused to have served and then send others in uniform to die for your own political and profit benefit. That is exactly what Bush and Cheney have done and those who support them, knowing what the facts are, are even more lowdown and vile than they.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>9. Cowards act in secret, they cover up the facts, they spy on anyone and everyone, they spread lies about those who disagree with them and they use the power of religion to foster even more FUD - Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt. FUD is the most effective marketing techinque used in business when a competitor launces a product that is both better than yours and costs less. The art of FUD was perfected by Hitler's SS, but it was turned into a science by Karl Rove. You remember Karl Rove, don't you? He's the little fucker that sold out a CIA agent because he didn't like her husband telling the truth about our phoney war.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>10. The actions of the federal government taken during Katrina, the promises made by the President on national TV and the resulting fuck you given to survivors since shows us exactly what is in the hearts, and on the minds of these fearful rats who have gnawed their way into power. Remember that Karl Rove was put in charge of our national response to Katrina. You remember Karl Rove don't you? Even though he's a gay man, he wants you to think Hillary wouldn't be a good President because of her gender... Maybe she doesn't wear enough leather for his taste.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The time has come for brave men and women to stand up to these quaking int their brokeback cowboy boot cowards, pull their designer pants down in public and expose their shortcomings.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The time has come to overthrow these cowards with a revolution of courage, conviction and citizens in the street. I'm talking about getting rid of this cowardly failed President before he turns the Presidental Seal into a Zacky Farms chicken.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>You'll have to be brave, and fearless, because most of the Democratic party won't be at your side, they'll be too busy hiding and waiting for someone else to take on these bedwetting bastards. They'll cluck and argue with you all day long about why you shouldn't take a stand.<br />
<br />But we can do it. We've done it before and we have what it takes to do it again.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>If we have to push all you cowardly lions who say "it can't be done," because you know YOU don't have the guts inside you to be part of a better way, then we'll be happy to shove you hard and rough enough for you to fall back onto your couches for the next installment of Bill O'Reilly's Manly Tales of Toe Sucking. Go ahead, have yourself another beer.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>All you hand-wringing, mealy mouth, fretters are merely the tampons inside the big pussy currently stinking up the White House. Despite the posted warnings you have attempted to flush yourselves through America's moral plumbing.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>No wonder the entire system is now clogged, backed up with grease and hair and spewing raw sewage all over the Oval Office.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>It's going to take one brave person to clean up that mess.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I'm not afraid of the job... are you?</span>
