<div><p>I think there must be a class where Democrats learn how to look offended. S.R. Sidarth graduated with honors:</p>

<br />Oh the humanity.</p>

<p>The photo accompanies <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/15/AR2006081501210.html">Allen on Damage Control After Remarks to Webb Aide,</a> in which Michael Shear and Tim Craig phone around to see if they can find any others who are offended by Sen. George Allen's use of the the word &quot;macaca,&quot; a term practically no one ever heard before. Yesterday, NRO's <a href="http://media.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWQ0ZjRkOWIxNGM2ZDg1NjBmYTYxYTI5NmJjYmU5M2U=">Stephen Spruiell</a> said in passing that he didn't think the story was getting too much coverage, calling Allen's use of the word &quot;boorish and idiotic.&quot; A tip of the integrity hat to Stephen for criticizing someone on his own side of the aisle when he thinks it's called for. But I'm having a hard time getting worked up about it, wondering instead if the Post will go for a hat trick and run an A1 story on this manufactured dispute <em>three</em> days in a row. Like <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081400589.html">Steve Mukherjee,</a> spokesman for the Association of Indians in America,&nbsp; I don't know what it means. Like the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/14/AR2006081401114.html">Post editorial board,</a> <em>We have no inkling as to what Mr. Allen meant by &quot;Macaca.&quot;</em> Unlike them, and others whose careers are based on feeling insulted, I'm unwilling to use my lack of knowledge as the foundation for a political assault.</p>

<p>Renowned scholar <a href="http://ace.mu.nu/archives/192660.php">Ace of Spades</a> says it means &quot;stooge,&quot; &quot;puppet,&quot; &quot;errand boy,&quot; etc. Boorish, fine; but mainly I'm thinking the Post should register with the FEC for having made an in-kind contribution to the Webb campaign.</p>
