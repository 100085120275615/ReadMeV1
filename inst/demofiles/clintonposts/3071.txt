<span>A senior official in the Bush administration says he doesn't think Hillary Clinton will run for reelection in New York in 2006. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>"You miss all those votes" if you try for the party's presidential nomination while still serving in the Senate, the official said. And, the official added, you don't want to be put in the position in which John Kerry found himself in 2003, when the Massachusetts senator felt compelled to vote against the $87 billion package of reconstruction and military aid for Iraq and Afghanistan because he was fighting for his life against the antiwar candidate Howard Dean.</span>
<br />
<br />He adds, <span>"Hillary could do herself some major damage inside her party if she causes it to lose ground in the Senate and lose its best shot in Albany in a decade." </span>
<span> On this point I have to disagree with him.  He makes the mistake of assuming Hillary cares about anyone but herself.  Also the democratic party would never hold that against her if they thought she could win the presidency.</span>
