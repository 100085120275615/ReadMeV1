Hillary Clinton (D-NY) in 2006, Westchester district attorney Jeanine Pirro (R) said "that she would not seek re-election this fall but would instead enter the United States Senate race or another statewide contest next year," the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/24/nyregion/metrocampaigns/24pirro.html"> New York Times</a> reports.<br /><br />"Such a half step toward an announcement is unusual, but Ms. Pirro, a Republican, apparently calculated it to be in her interest after weeks of pleas from party leaders in Albany, New York City and Washington who are eager to mold her as a new Republican star in advance of the 2006 races."<br /><br />The Journal News notes the biggest liability for Republicans: "Pirro carries the baggage of being married to a real-estate lawyer and lobbyist who served time in federal prison for tax fraud. It's a particular liability upstate, where she is not well known." <br />Heather
