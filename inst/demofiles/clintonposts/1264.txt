<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/hillary-clinton-time_b_27726.html">Arianna Huffington</a> offers a fine diagnosis of Hillary Clinton:<br />
<blockquote>In its new cover story on Hillary Clinton's "presidential ambitions," <span>Time </span>magazine reports that on top of 32 full-time employees and 10 Senate staffers partially assigned to it, Clinton's "political operation" now includes 13 political consultants. That seems like quite a bit of input for someone the article describes as "genuinely undecided" about running for president.<br />
<br />But it is very much in keeping with the political profile that has emerged since Hillary transformed herself from First Lady to Presumptive Presidential Frontrunner. And that profile is unmistakably of a politician more comfortable following than leading.<br />
<br />There are politicians with great instincts as leaders -- those who recognize not just the crises directly in front of them, but those around the corner as well. (And these leadership instincts come from the gut, not from a multitude of consultants, strategists, and pollsters.)<br />And there are politicians with great instincts as followers -- those who are the first to stick their fingers in the air and notice even the slightest shift in the wind of popular opinion. (And these followership instincts are a political consultant's wet dream.)<br />
<br />In this second group, no one is as attuned to the zephyrs of change as Hillary Clinton. She is the quintessential political weather vane.</blockquote>Why even the wettest of corporate liberals ever fell for Hillary will perhaps remain forever a great mystery. Why the right-wing are so determined to bring her down is an even greater mystery. Can any sane person really imagine that she stands a ghost of a chance in a Presidential election against any Republican candidate?<br />
