Recently, meanwhile, a Pentagon study conducted by Army Lt. Col. Andrew F. Krepinevich of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments concluded that the U.S. military is stretched into a "thin green line." In the spring of 2005, Gen. Richard Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, issued a similar warning in congressional testimony, and, during the previous December, Lt. Gen. James Helmly, head of the Army Reserve, wrote a letter to colleagues expressing "deepening concern" about the readiness of his 200,000 solidiers, who were, in his words, "rapidly degenerating into a 'broken' force."<br /><br />The political danger for Bush and the GOP is that these pressures on the military could further sour the mood of military families and friends -- in other words, people who normally would be inclined to support a wartime president and his party.<br /><br />The biggest GOP fear this year is that its base will not motivated; it won't help the party if voters in military communities are frustrated. Meanwhile, the general public mood is already downbeat; in a new poll released last week, the Pew Research Center found record-high pessimisim about the war. Fifty-five percent now say the war isn't going well (that stat was 44 percent last January), and, by a margin of 52 to 41 percent, most Americans want to set a timetable for troop withdrawal. The Marines' decision certainly won't nudge those numbers in Bush's favor.</blockquote><br /><br />CQ: <a href="http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/08/democratic_breeze_being_felt_i.html">Democratic Breeze Being Felt in Fight for State Legislatures</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/08/senate_dems_spend_big_in_july.html">Senate Dems Spend Big in July But Maintain Cash Advantage</a><br /><br /><a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2006/08/parsing_the_polls_terrorism_an.html">Cillizza looks at the polls and what they tell us about the terrorism issue and midterms</a>, while DemFromCT looks at <a href="http://thenexthurrah.typepad.com/the_next_hurrah/2006/08/presidential_ap.html">presidential approval and midterms</a><br /><br />MoveOn has ads up in key CDs re: Iraq. <a href="http://political.moveon.org/iraqads/">Watch it here.</a> Hotline 8/23 reports:<br /><blockquote>MoveOn Political Action today launched a new ad campaign against House GOPers who support the Bush admin.'s "failed policy in Iraq." According to MoveOn, the ads focus on the GOP's "failure to protect American troops and taxpayers from war profiteering" by companies such as Halliburton, and "the waste of billions of dollars needed for healthcare, schools, and other priorities at home."<br /><br />     The first ad, titled "Dumping Billions," targets incumbent House GOPers for "pouring billions of dollars into Iraq while needs at home remain unmet." The second ad, titled "Red-Handed Defense," accuses GOP incumbents of "protecting war profiteering companies" that "overcharged for military services in Iraq."<br /><br />     The first round of TV ads will run through 9/1 in the districts of Reps. John Sweeney (R-NY), Randy Kuhl (R-NY) and Charles Bass (R-NH). The second ad ran in four other districts in 6/06 against incumbent Reps. Nancy Johnson (R-CT), Deborah Pryce (R-OH), Chris Chocola (R-IN), and Thelma Drake (R-VA). [...]<br /><br />     The ads are verbatim except for the name and state of the congressperson and the state they represent. [...]<br /> <br />ANNCR: "What happened to the $300 billion dollars we sent to Iraq? Halliburton got $18 billion. $9 billion is just plain missing. And our CONGRESSPERSON has been caught red-handed voting for all of it. That's something we need for jobs and health care here in STATE. Now, CONGRESSPERSON is ready to dump billions more in Iraq.

He said the comparison comes from physical resemblance.<br /><br />     On the issues, Seals "lines up with this year's" nat'l Dem "playbook," but he does go out "on more liberal limbs" on Iraq and health care. He supports a "responsible withdrawal" of troops within 1 year and backs a "single-payer" health system. As for the incumbent, Seals points to Rep. Mark Kirk's (R) poor environmental ratings and a vote to cut veterans' benefits. Seals: "If he's voting 90 percent of the time [with GOPers], he's clearly not [ex-IL 10 Rep.] John Porter (R). Kirk, "a leader of the moderates," in the House "will have some good rebuttals for Seals' criticisms." And he's "been raising money like mad."

Barbara Cubin (R-WY AL) only won 60% of the primary vote last night -- the second-lowest total for a victorious incumbent this cycle. Her weak performance could foreshadow a potential upset from ex-Teton Co. School Board Chair Gary Trauner (D).<br /><br />-- Trauner's been a grass-roots candidate, knocking on over 13,000 doors across the state, particularly in more competitive parts (Cheyenne, Casper, Laramie, Teton Co.). State Dems view him as more charismatic than past Dem nominees. He's also been a surprisingly good fundraiser, banking nearly as much as Cubin.<br /><br />-- The environment could emerge as a key issue in the campaign. Trauner opposes selling off federally-owned lands, telling HRH he wants "public lands in public hands." Cubin attacked Clinton's land-use policies in her first election -- a tactic she may use again this time.<br /><br />-- Cubin has underperformed in one of the most conservative states (69% for Bush in '00/'04). In '04, she only won 55% in both the primary and general. Will the strong GOP tilt in WY push her to victory, or will Trauner's retail politicking pay off in a community-oriented state?</blockquote><br /><br /><b>2008</b><br /><a href="http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.san&s=47111&Nid=22722&p=233729">Report: Politicos To Boost Web Spending In '08</a><br /><br /><a href="http://news.greenvilleonline.com/blogs/hoover/2006/08/second_fiddle_no_more.html?hlc">SC Dems thinking about Dem pres debate in early 2007</a> Around 4/27-4/28.
