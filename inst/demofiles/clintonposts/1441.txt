Their daughter Annie, whose constant needling led to their lawsuit, served as ring-bearer and flower girl.<br /><br />When Julie was giving birth by cesarean section to Annie, there were complications. Because Hilary had no legal or biological connection to mother or child at the time, she was often kept from seeing her family in the hospital. That's no longer an issue.<br /><br />Now it turns out it was all a big waste of time.<br /><br />"Even though their number one priority was their daughter," Breslauer said, "marriage makes her also their legal obligation. Their daughter is more protected because they are married."<br /><br />Both of the Goodridges are declining to comment on the news, referring all question to Breslauer, who is acting as their spokesperson.
