<p>McCain isn&#8217;t a straight talker, he&#8217;s nothing but a spinner and a two face. One of his faces is the maverick, while the other face is the appeaser and party loyalist.</p>
<p>A few examples: <br />
1.) In 2000, McCain denounced Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson as the religious right&#8217;s &#8220;peddlers of intolerance&#8221; after the South Carolina primary, because they&#8217;d smeared him so badly. In fact, maybe some of you remember that McCain even condemned Bush back then as being &#8220;a Pat Robertson Republican.&#8221;<br />
Now, as we all know, he has met with Falwell and spoke at Fallwell&#8217;s Liberty University. He now claims: &#8220;I admire the religious right for the dedication and zeal they put into the political process&#8221; when he appears on Larry King. Oh, and now he also endorses &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; and thinks it should be taught in schools alongside evolution, and supports a state ban on gay marriage that denies government benefits to all unmarried couples. </p>
<p>Some straight talker, sure.</p>
<p>2.) In 2000 when the (anti-tax) Club for Growth began running ads against McCain, he suddenly and totally reversed all his former positions and began supporting a procedural repeal of the estate tax. </p>
<p>Ads seem to be the quickest way of making McCain sing the appeaser tune rather than the &#8220;maverick&#8221; tune.</p>
<p>3.) Bush and his Rove slime machine totally trashed McCain in 2000, but in 2004 he said: &#8220;Campaigning with George W. Bush was one of the proudest moments of my life.&#8221; He&#8217;ll go on TV and make comments that are critical of Bush&#8217;s handling of Iraq, yet we&#8217;re supposed to forget all about the fact that he strongly defended those Iraq policies on the stage of the Republican National Convention in 2004.<br />
<br />
Why should anyone actually believe a word the man says when he&#8217;s so patently false?</p>
<p>Here are a few other facts about McCain: while he opposes hate crimes legislation, he supports school vouchers, the star wars defense shield (even though it doesn&#8217;t work), and privitized accounts for Social Security (even though everyone knows that won&#8217;t fix the problem).</p>
<p>As for Hillary, I see her as being not much different than McCain &#8212; like him, she isn&#8217;t authentic when it comes to her opinions, instead she&#8217;s always got her finger in the wind trying to be all things to all people. Oh, wait &#8212; except when it comes to supporting the war in Iraq, then she&#8217;s a lot like Joe Lieberman &#8212; she&#8217;s been all for it, for who knows what reason.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t and won&#8217;t vote for her to be the president should she get the nomination.</p>
<p>Biden&#8217;s just all right, IMO. He&#8217;s obviously bright, and certainly has some good ideas. But he talks too damn much &#8212; and I don&#8217;t know why, but for some reason, he&#8217;s always struck me as the professional political type, too (just like McCain and Hillary) &#8212; you know, kinda greasy and sleazy beneath all that smiling affability. </p>
<p>As some of you may already know, <a href="http://i71.photobucket.com/albums/i151/slemieux66/RussaddressesarallyinGreenBay.jpg" rel="nofollow">I really like Sen. Russ Feingold.</a><br />
He&#8217;s brilliant, unapologetically a social liberal while being fiscally conservative, unapologetically authentic and firm in his opinions, yet still able to reach across the aisle. I really hope he&#8217;ll run in 2008, because with his smarts, voting record, articulate public speaking ability, and obvious authenticity, I believe he could easily win, and do a great job for the whole country.<br />
Just my opinion. </p>
