My friends and I had a State of the Union Party, camping out in the apartment with TiVo.  We armed ourselves with chocolate chip cookies & print-outs of Whoâs Who (like the mysterious people sitting with Laura Bush).  We handed out copies of the official State of the Union drinking game rules.  The instructions: drink every time the President mentions âfreedom,â âevilâ or âevil-doers.â  Good thing most of us werenât drinking.  Those words kept coming up, and after all, it was a weeknight.<br /><br />Iâll never forget the State of the Union during the Monica Lewinsky trial, when Bill Clinton took the mike and didnât mention the scandal but distracted America with his smooth talk.  What a powerful public speaker.  If only they were all that brilliant.<br /><br />George W. did well, considering he doesnât have that gift.  He asserted his beliefs and made ONE FUNNY JOKE, which is more than most State of the Unions.  He said two of his dadâs favorite people are turning 60, Bill Clinton and himself.  Hillary didnât crack a smile, but in this instance, we donât know if her anger was directed at W. or Bill.  <br /><br />Hillaryâs mocking face was hilarious throughout the speech.  The emotion was spilling out her pores.  She couldnât contain her scorn for the current president.  I bet sheâd be awful at cards - No poker face at all.<br /><br />New Chief Justice Samuel Alito looked dazed and sleepy, but heâd had a long day, getting sworn in and all.  John Kerry wasnât too happy.  âIt couldâve been me,â was his expression.  âIt couldâve been me.â<br /><br /><blockquote><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/02/02/BL2006020200419.html<br />"><br />"><br />">The Washington Post Article</a></blockquote><br />(This post is by an aspiring actress whoâs dated most of Manhattan.
