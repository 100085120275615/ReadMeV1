<div><p>For American politicians, the political 'listening tour' has become a curious convention in recent years, employed most famously and arguably most successfully by Hillary Clinton six years ago when she was seeking to be elected for the first time to the U.S. Senate from the state of New York, despite having had an address on Pennsylvania Avenue as her home for the prior eight years.</p>

<p>At Aspen, international attendees argued the United States needs to do a far better job not only listening to its own citizens, but listening to the populations around the world - especially due to the important role the U.S. government can play as a mediator and superpower in conflicts overseas.</p>

<p>"Not a single Arab-Israeli agreement has ever been achieved without U.S. involvement, so the United States is very important to the peace process," said Nabil Fahmy, Egypt's ambassador to the United States.  "But America does not listen well to those in the Middle East; as a result, it sees the trends too late.  Jordanian kings and Egyptian presidents warned many times of the danger of rising anti-Americanism should the U.S. involve itself militarily in Iraq."</p>

<p>Although the Aspen event concluded two days before Hezbollah abducted two Israeli soldiers, it occured in the week after Palestinian gunmen killed two Israeli soldiers and captured Corporal Gilad Shalit near the Kerem Shalom border with Gaza.  The fierce Israeli reaction to both incidents has demonstrated their growing frustration with mounting hostile firepower on lands it sought to concede peacefully.</p>

<p>"Since we left Gaza there is no law of order," explained Israel's U.S. Ambassador Daniel Ayalon, who is due to return to Israel and seen on a career fast track. "We see smuggling of thousands of explosives and ever more improved weapon grade and Hamas, which is now supposedly the government of the Palestinians, is directly engaged in terrorism."</p>

<p>The comments certainly appeared to foreshadow what was in store for Hezbollah when it provoked Israel a few days later on July 12, attacking military posts at Shebaa Farms and abducting two Israeli soldiers.  </p>

<p>The discussions at Aspen, which concentrated more on the impact of U.S. foreign policy than on the role of other nations, also seemed to anticipate today's relative aloofness of the Bush administration on a variety of fronts, whether in its seemingly quiessent stance on Israel's counter-attacks on Hamas and Hezbollah - where many Arab states have also been uncharacteristically silent - to its relatively muted responses to Iran's defiant nuclear program, escallating Iraqi violence and North Korea's test missile launches.</p>

<p>Among those issuing the strongest warning over U.S. policies was Sir Richard Dearlove, the well spoken former chief of MI6, the British secret intelligence service. Sir Richard could be heard over several days cautioning Americans over policies which did not permit it to regain "the moral high ground" necessary to elevate its reputation in the world as a force of good.</p>

<p>Sir Richard, now Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, is also seen as having a key hand in reporting the now infamous Downing Street Memo to the Blair government in summer 2002 in which it said U.S. intelligence was "being fixed around the policy" and that an Iraq invasion was "seen as inevitable."  Yet in questioning he protested the reported text had come from a draft of which significant wording had been changed, though he was under oath not to reveal any more detail.</p>

<p>The fears of the former "C," in James Bond terminology, were echoed by French philosopher and writer Bernard-Henry Levy, who waxed eloquently about what it means to be an American but also labeled the growing anti-Americanism in Europe and elsewhere as "one of our calamities," arguing it would not beeasily or swiftly reversed.</p>

<p>The theme of the high road was picked up in its own way by other speakers, ranging from former Secretary of State Colin Powell, who encouraged participants to focus on the best America offers the world without claiming territorial gains, to President Clinton, who argued U.S. leadership should not shy away from seeking to resolve world issues with talks, admitting he had been faulted for spending too much time working to hammer out a Palestinian-Israeli settlement, though he felt it had been close.</p>

<p>"This whole thing that there are some people we shouldn't talk to because they're bad is nuts," said Clinton, urging leaders not to "freak out" over North Korea nor to place too many terms on initiating talks with Iran, for example.  "I don't think Americans should put too many preconditions on talks with the Iranians.  We shouldn't cook it too much in advance.  I also think it would be a matter of serious consequence to think we can attack them militarily."</p>

<p>"It's right to talk to some of your enemies," he said, citing Hamas as a party which likely should be approached following its Palestinian election victory despite its hostile opposition to Israel and its rejection of certain international accords and its failure to renounce terror.</p>

<p>He said he had "a split decision" about how Hamas should be dealt with, however, saying it was certainly right to provide humanitarian aid, while also correct of President Bush and the European Union to deny other forms of aid. Regarding talks, he said, "there are all kinds of ways to do it... You don't have to advertise it.  You don't have to put it in your paper."</p>

<p>At another session, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright insisted solutions could be hammered out even with hostile governments amid a climate of distrust "by knowing enough about what the other side wants, and what the other side things."<a href="http://conferenzablog.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/madeleinealbrightsignsbooks"><img src="http://conferenzablog.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/madeleinealbrightsignsbooks" title="Madeleinealbrightsignsbooks" alt="Madeleinealbrightsignsbooks" border="0" class="image-full" /></a></p>

<p>"It's a mistake to think that the U.S. is the only country with a national interest," she said, adding that the Bush administrations "ABC - Anything But Clinton" approach to government had especially hampered foreign policy on issues like North Korea, where it resulted in deliberately dropping the efforts of the previous administration and fostering further distrust.</p>

<p>But getting to know the other side often required making extra efforts and working hard to listen in challenging circumstances.  Speaking a day and a half after North Korea had fired three test missiles at the time of America's Independence Day celebraitons, reminded a full seminar room that she had traveled to North Korea to meet ruler Kim Jung Il.</p>

<p>"Our intelligence said he was crazy and a pervert.  He was not crazy," she said, to a delayed chuckle.  "It was perfectly possible to have a rational conversation with him... The problem is he lives in a totally closed information system.  He believes in, I guess, His own divinity in some sort of way."</p>

<p>The former secretary of state said she was not charmed, but rather fascinated by his behavior, including at their first news conference, when she realized not only were they about the same size, but that, "I had on high heels, and he did, too."</p>

<p>Former intelligence director Jim Woolsey compared the strength of Kim Jung Il's ideology to that of Adolf Hitler, who sought a 1,000 year reich and elimination of the Jewish people. Woolsey said of the Nazi dictator that "he was nuts but in rationality and tactics, he was brilliant."  </p>

<p>Asked whether she would consider the nuclear weapons politics of North Korea as a game of chess, Secretary Albright likened it more to pool or billiards, where shots were often banked off bumpers in various directions, and each time a player returned to the table their angles of attacking the game had generally all changed.</p>

<p>Reviling at the polarization of Washington, Albright said she is working with conservative Republican Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas and others in an effort to find areas where the left and right in American politics can work together, especially on international issues such as stopping genocide, helping refugees and encouraging religious tolerance.</p>

<p>"I learned American history in Colorado and sided with the Cowboys," said Albright.</p>

<p>As fortune would have it, Albright's recollection would not have been the best analogy in the "Marble Garden Tent" a few hours earlier, where Lord John Alderdice a negotiator of the Northern Ireland Good Friday 1998 peace accord, explained America's reputation may not be exactly helped in the current environment by the movie images of cowboys storming into town and wiping out native Americans.</p>

<p>In this context, he said, it should not be difficult to understand why the arrival of the U.S. Calvary overseas may not exactly be greeted as automatically bringing salvation to the local people.</p></div>
