She caught the man in the act of robbing her home of its valuables and yelled.<br /><br />"Stop! Acts 2:38. (Repent and be baptized, in the name of Jesus Christ so that your sins may be forgiven.)<br /><br />The burglar stopped in his tracks. The woman calmly called the police and<br />explained what she had done. As the officer cuffed the man to take him in, he asked the burglar, "Why did you just stand there? All the lady did was yell a scripture to you." "Scripture?" replied the burglar. "She said she had an Ax and Two 38's."<br />*********************<br />Another one from Fish:<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/389/727/1600/Fish%206.0.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/389/727/320/Fish%206.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />*********************<br /><a href="http://thecanadiansentinel.blogspot.com/">Canadian Sentinal</a> sent me these pictures of this amazing Bengel Tiger.

The best ones are at the top of the<br />tree. Most men don't want to reach for the good ones because they are<br />afraid of falling and getting hurt. Instead, they sometimes take the<br />apples from the ground that aren't as good, but easy. The apples at<br />the top think something is wrong with them, when in reality, they're<br />amazing. They just have to wait for the right man to come along, the<br />one who is brave enough to  climb all the way to the top of the tree.<br />Now Men... Men are like a fine wine. They begin as grapes, and it's<br />up to women to stomp the crap out of them until they turn into<br />something acceptable to have dinner with.<br /><br /><i>It's just a joke... I love men, truly I do.  Where would we be without them?

"A normal person would use the bucket because it's bigger than the spoon or the teacup.<br /><br />"No," said the Director, "A normal person would pull the plug.

No one on the ground was injured.<br /><br />Photographs taken at the scene show the extent of damage to Senator Clinton's aircraft. She was very lucky.<br /><br /><a href="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f227/Garpi/HillaryClintonsAircraft.jpg"><img src="http://i48.photobucket.com/albums/f227/Garpi/HillaryClintonsAircraft.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
