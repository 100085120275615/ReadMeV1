<div>Evan Bayh. I doubt any of you - my few, very few, none, actually, loyal readers - know who he is. The Senator and former Governor of Indiana is the son of the legendary Birch Bayh, a senator from 1963 to 1981. The elder Senator Bayh was the author of the failed Equal Rights Amendment. His son was the keynote speaker of the 1996 Democratic Convention - chosen by President Clinton to be so in order to get back to the heartland - a key part to win the presidency. Only one Democrat has won the presidency from the North since World War II and it was his connections to the Chicago political machine that allowed him to do so.
<br />
<br />Senator Bayh will defeat Hillary Clinton and a host of others in the primaries because too many people have an eternal hate for her. He will unlock southern money while still appealing to northern sensibilities. He will hold the blue states and be able to open up the red states - something only a southerner can do.
<br />
<br />He will be the nominee for the presidency from the Democratic Party.
