	<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the 100-degree-plus temperatures, but I&#8217;m at that point in the cycle where I&#8217;m so confident in what I know that I&#8217;m having nightmares about what I don&#8217;t know. </p>
	<p>Call it overthinking caused by overheating, but here are 10 things about this cycle that keep me from getting a good night&#8217;s sleep: </p>
	<p>1. Democratic GOTV</p>
	<p>This is at the top because it&#8217;s probably the biggest mystery of the cycle. It&#8217;s not clear who is funding get-out-the-vote efforts for the Democrats this year, or more important, who is running them. Is it a coordinated state-based campaign with a loose connection to the Democratic National Committee? Is it labor, and if so, which part &#8212; John Sweeney&#8217;s the AFL-CIO or Andy Stern&#8217;s SEIU? And where did all the money from America Coming Together go? Will even half of it make it back into Democratic coffers in some capacity? There are still lots of unanswered questions, and Election Day is less than five months away. </p>
	<p>2. The Ohio White Whale</p>
	<p>Democrats are practically giddy about Ohio thanks to an outgoing governor with an approval rating south of 20. So while the party&#8217;s two-decade drought in gubernatorial elections should end, will GOP Gov. Bob Taft&#8217;s unpopularity really transfer to Sen. Mike DeWine and a handful of House Republicans? The Democrats are promising a lot of money and resources for Ohio, but it&#8217;s quite possible that in federal races, there is a 47 to 48 percent ceiling for the party. In the long term, Ohio is a bad investment for Democrats. It&#8217;s a state that is moving away from them demographically, not to mention its shrinking general population. </p>
	<p>3. Underestimating Immigration</p>
	<p>Long-time readers of this column and The Hotline know that we&#8217;ve had a hard time buying into immigration as a real issue for any set of voters outside the GOP&#8217;s core base. But we&#8217;ve been surprised at the concern voters of all stripes are expressing about this issue, as well as the consistency of those views. It&#8217;s possible Democrats can simply triangulate the issue and attempt to neutralize it, but it remains an issue that could very well save the GOP a few House seats &#8212; and the majority. </p>
	<p>4. Overestimating The 72-Hour Program</p>
	<p>After the GOP&#8217;s victory in Calif.-50, we sensed not just relief among Republican strategists, but borderline cockiness. The conceit is due to the incredible confidence the party has in the 72-hour program. Clearly, the Republicans have come up with both a formula and a strategy for GOTV that has allowed the Republicans to not only catch up to Democrats and labor, but perhaps surpass them. </p>
	<p>That said, a turnout program is only as successful as its worst election night. So, until the 72-hour program proves it can turn losses into wins (like it may have done in Calif.-50), then the jury&#8217;s still out. The 72-hour program needs a fired up activist base to work. What if the base is depressed? Will as many phone calls be made? Will as many volunteers show up? </p>
	<p>5. Terri Schiavo</p>
	<p>No act of Congress might be as well remembered by the electorate, particularly Floridians, as the intervention of Congress in the Terri Schiavo medical care dispute. For some, the intervention served as the tipping point that the Republican Party had become too pro-government. The libertarian wing of the GOP may not be solid. Combine it with the so-called &#8220;security moms&#8221; who weren&#8217;t thrilled with all the conservative white males making decisions for a woman, and there could be a bigger backlash for the GOP on this issue. That&#8217;s the case particularly in Florida, but also to a lesser extent in Pennsylvania (due to GOP Sen. Rick Santorum&#8217;s high-profile role) and the Southwest (home to the libertarian wing of the GOP). </p>
	<p>6. New York Landslides</p>
	<p>More than half of the seats that Democrats need to win control of the House may very well be in New York. Toss in the rest of New England, and nearly all 15 could be won in this one tiny region. Part of the &#8216;94 blueprint for the GOP was that the party was successful at winning in places that were already voting Republican on a national level (such as the South). Could the same phenomenon be taking place for the Democrats? The inevitable landslides to come for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D) in her re-election campaign and Attorney General Eliot Spitzer (D) in his gubernatorial bid, combined with other traditionally blue congressional seats &#8220;coming home,&#8221; could be the Democrats&#8217; not-so-secret weapon. </p>
	<p>7. The Late-Breakers</p>
	<p>Every cycle has a few races that folks like us flat-out miss. Or if we don&#8217;t miss them, we just see them too late. Oklahoma governor &#8216;02, South Carolina governor &#8216;98, Iowa governor &#8216;98, Minnesota-02 &#8216;00, Connecticut-02 &#8216;00 and even Kentucky Senate &#8216;04 are all recent examples. </p>
	<p>There are always late-breaking races. And while it may be too early to pick them for this year, a few contests are grabbing our attention, including: South Dakota governor (we&#8217;ve seen Republican Gov. Mike Rounds&#8217; approval ratings dip badly since the controversial abortion ban was signed); South Carolina governor (the media elite and Columbia establishment seem to have it in for Republican Gov. Mark Sanford); Wyoming At-Large (GOP Rep. Barbara Cubin has consistently under performed, and there seem to be signs of Democratic life in Vice President Dick Cheney&#8217;s home state) and Fla.-09 (sons of retiring members have had a tough time recently). </p>
	<p>8. The Fed-Up Voter</p>
	<p>It seems the Democrats are counting on voters being &#8220;fed up&#8221; or having &#8220;had enough&#8221; with the Republicans in order to increase turnout. But what if the angry voter is also an apathetic voter? There&#8217;s growing evidence that voters are less interested in this election than some in the Democratic Party would like. Earlier this week, USA Today put together an excellent run-down of the surprisingly low-turnout numbers in the early primary states. Should the centrist/left-leaning angry voters turn into apathetic voters, then one can envision just how the Republicans, via base turnout advantage, could cobble together the votes to keep their majorities. </p>
	<p>9. The 2000 Accidental Senators</p>
	<p>In 2000, a group of Democratic Senate candidates seemingly came from behind in a last-minute surge over a bunch of incumbent Republican senators who, frankly, were there only because of over-performance in the &#8216;94 cycle. Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell (D), former Missouri Sen. Jean Carnahan (D) and Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D) seemed to snatch victory from defeat, thanks in large part to a surge in Democratic turnout. But Carnahan is already a former senator, and two of the GOP&#8217;s better recruits are in Washington and Michigan. </p>
	<p>10. Missing A Wave</p>
	<p>This point may be last, but it is probably just as important as any on this list. Many analysts failed to predict the GOP&#8217;s wave in &#8216;94 for a variety of reasons, most notably a lack of confidence in the Republicans to actually pull it off &#8212; even as polls showed otherwise. This cycle has a similar feel. The reason many analysts aren&#8217;t ready to jump on the Democratic bandwagon just yet is the lack of confidence in the strategic leadership of the party. This is, after all, the party that messed up &#8216;00, missed the issue matrix of &#8216;02, believed Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry was the most &#8220;electable&#8221; candidate in &#8216;04 and has shown little evidence in &#8216;06 of truly knowing what&#8217;s necessary to win now. But sometimes, the voters roll the dice. </p>
