<br />Got sex ? Use it or lose it â¦or are you saving it up for that special occasion? If you wonât have the inclination to indulge, or polish it up for window-display, at least once this season, recycling (or even loaning it out) might be the option for you. Did you think that consignment shop rule was just for last yearâs Fendi Spy Bag, those strategically peek-a-boo flesh-exposing bell bottoms or Xboxâs Ninja Gaiden Black ( say what, E3? And shouldnât the word âfashionistaâ itself be so <em>last year</em>)<br />
<br />Recycling has âre-imagedâ itself over the decades from the flower-child, nature-loving/ uni-tear-splashed, anti-pollute, anciently wrinkled Native American in the 70s, to the entrepreneurial going-through- the- neighborâs -trash to pick up some spare change in the 80s. This century itâs either an almost patriotic under-municipal ordinance mandate in some neighborhoods, or a âyeah, whatever, I- can- if- I- feel- like-itâ individual empowerment for many other communities. While the Good Will and Salvation Army are synonymously branded with used apparel and household goods, the <a href="http://www.lionsclubs.org/EN/content/vision_eyeglass_centers.shtml">Lions Club asks for used eye glasses</a>, and many new foundations, and as many scams, have gotten on the donate old cell phone to the used-car band-wagons.<br />
<br />But like most anything--sex was the original. Recycled sex began right after humping between humans consumated, 35,000 or 6 million year ago, depending on if you believe in evolution or intelligent design creationism.<br />
<br />My friend Sylvia, sent me a card a long time ago, when either she or I were going through one of our many breakups with men. It unfolded into countless, indistinguishable cartoon hetero and gay couples, each wrapped in each otherâs arms with one hand reaching out for one hand of the couple next to them. Remember, the old anti-âvenereal diseaseâ -- VD? -- public announcements, cautioning that you slept with everyone your partner slept with prior to you? Taking in account <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/0,,sid9_gci932596,00.html">six- degrees of separation</a>, itâs very plausible that you and I, dear blog reader, have Bill and Hillaryâs passed-on love juices somewhere in us. (They did it at least once, you all.) Probably GWâs and Lauraâs (and Condi? if those Internet rumors had any merit), your favorite celeb sex symbol, and Bin Laden, and your next-door neighbor, too. We all breathe a statistically connected lust imprintâfantastical or genetic.<br />
<br />Not just in airplanes, either. And our genitals and asses, concealed with permeable fabric, sit in the same public chairs. Educatorâs often explain âone earthâ ecology to children by illustrating that weâre all drinking and eating dinosaurâs #1 and #2 (thatâs pee-pee and poop; #3 is still open to your imaginations). Reconditioned sex â from our thoughts to our serial-partnersâ makes it an <a href="http://smallworld.columbia.edu/">itâs-a small world</a> continuum, my fellow kissing-cousins to Charlemagne, Ghengis Khan and genetic Eve. Politically correct or germaphobe-protective condom users, itâs not just semen and vaginal secretions that a good reusable make, though that makes itâs sensorially more interesting; itâs about the given-away emotion, as well as the fucking.<br />
<br />Donât feel that special something for your lover anymore? Donât worry about having to repair the worn-out feelings, just âmove on,â he or she will be picked up curbside, barside, or bedside by someone new, sooner or later. And you, too, can have opportunity for improved, retro-fitted sex. If a virgin is your new love, she/he would probably be a product of two recycled sex persons (RSPs ), unless the parents were virgins themselves when they did the deed. Since we all came from sperm and ovum, recycling canât be avoided, as we have some generational connection to our biological parents. That is, in some ways youâre having incestuous sexual instruction with that vivacious blondeâs great grand-dad/mom and your own aboriginal ancestral cave dwellers. (In ancestor worshipping traditional Sri Lanka, a tenth-year ritual burial-clothes cleansing coincides with those same linens blessing a wedding bed, if that doesnât creep the sex right out of the honeymoon!)<br />
<br />A man I recently met told me his ex-wife married an old friend of his with his approval. He had dated that friendâs ex-wife before he had married his own ex-wife, and the now adult children from each of the original marriages had dated each other a few years before both sets of parents had gotten divorced. The friendâs ex-wife asked the man if it wouldnât be great if they, too, got it on again. <em>Love Boat</em> meets <em>Brady Bunch</em> was a smidge too retro for him, even though the sexual connection had already been previously established.<br />
<br />
<br />Personally, I try to hold on to people, just like my things. I wear my momâs Fifties' fashions every few years, and even showcased my ex-mother- in- laws Sixties' styled dress to an extended family event recently. I find myself re-visiting my old loversâ lanes in between relationships, rather than add another notch with someone new. There is something about the passage of time blending re-kindled remembrance that emotionally seasons an energetic coming home. So, long as we donât wear out the visit.<br />
<br />But mostly, my own sex waits in the closet a bit more than the clothes, or more aptly biding time in a holding pound for yet another recyclable adoption. Part bitch and part pussy (I know, I know, but those words work here), my <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0154061/plotsummary">cat-dog</a> self pants-purrs for a loving home with a strong <a href="http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/online/exhibitions/childhood/fido.asp">fido-lion</a> for mutual licking of coats, sniffing of scents, clean water, and a really hard bone for me to play with. We can take turns protecting the house, be finicky about the litter box, and entertain each other with rolling-over and sexy pet tricks (passed down from the supply of mutually linked two billion past adult sex partners.) And if the time comes, ungrudgingly, "hand me-down" each otherâs paw to someoneâs new claws, unless we choose, finally this time, to mulch our mingled sex the way of those dinosaurs-- to death do us part.</div>
