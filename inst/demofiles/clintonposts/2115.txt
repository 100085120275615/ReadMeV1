<br />Although... I think we should alter the lyrics a little bit:<br />
<br />Rice for President<br />Rice for President<br />Rice for President<br />Rice for President<br />You like Rice<br />I like Rice<br />Everybody likes Rice (for President)<br />Hang out the banner<br />Beat the drum<br />We'll take Rice to Washington<br />We don't want John or Dean or Hillary<br />Let's do that big job right!<br />Let's get in step with the gal that's hep<br />Get in step with Rice<br />You like Rice<br />I like Rice<br />Everybody likes Rice for President<br />Hang out the banner<br />Beat the drum<br />We'll take Rice to Washington<br />We've got to get where we are going<br />Travel day and night<br />There's Hillaray, Go the other way<br />We'll all go with Rice<br />You like Rice<br />I like Rice<br />Everybody likes Rice (for President)<br />Hang out the banner<br />Beat the drum<br />We'll take Rice to Washington<br />We'll take Rice to Washington!</div>
