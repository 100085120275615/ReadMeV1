<div>I was driving to the post office on September 11, 2001 listening to talk radio when I heard the news report that planes had hit the World Trade Towers. I immediately turned around towards home and watched that horrible day unfold.<br />
<br />I knew then what the Liberals in this country and in the Senate still don't know.<br />
<br />This is World War IV.<br />
<br />London knows this after the attacks there yesterday by Muslim extremists.<br />Spain knows this after their train attacks my Muslim extremists.<br />Russia knows this after the school bombing my Muslim extremists.<br />
<br />Why don't the Liberals see this?<br />
<br />Because it makes them uncomfortable and question everything they believe.<br />
<br />They would have us do what Clinton did.<br />Pursue this war on terror in the courts, not as a real war.<br />
<br />We know what that got us. Terrorist attacks at The World Trade Center in 1993, bombings of our ships and Embassies and an emboldened Al Queada.<br />
<br />The liberals believe WE are the problem, not the Islamofacists.<br />
<br />The bombings in London were not even a few hours old when liberals were saying it was because we are in Iraq. How dumb is that.<br />
<br />We are in Iraq fighting the War On Terror---WWIV, and keeping it there rather than at home. Only a power hungry liberal would try and blame the United States for the bombing in London when the real guilty parties are the very ilk we are fighting in Iraq.<br />
<br />Only a liberal would think by giving the Iraqi people freedom means we have helped the terrorists. The very fact we are in Iraq scares the hell out of the terrorists.<br />
<br />Freedom frightens these EVIL people.<br />
<br />The London bombing brings to real life one of my fears as I travel from Washington D.C. to Philadelphia to visit family. I fear that the tunnels in Baltimore are a perfect terrorist target. Right out of the film Daylight. I travel through the tunnels with the top down on my car, look around the tunnel's ceiling and walls and wonder what the carnage would be if a bomb went off in there.<br />
<br />I do this because I am aware of what the liberals are not.<br />
<br />This is World War IV.<br />
<br />
<em>The liberals worry about the rights of the prisoners we catch on the battlefield as their terrorist friends blow up the London Underground. </em>
<br />
<br />
<em>The liberals accuse Bush of being a cowboy as the terrorists helpless kill women and children on a double-decker bus.</em>
<br />
<em>
<br />The liberals cry foul because we conservatives point out the <strong>FACTUAL </strong>connection between 911 and the terrorists around the world even as London becomes a war zone.</em>
<br />
<em>
<br />The liberals cry crocodile tears over civilian deaths in Iraq as our military does its job, and then they ignore the innocent civilian deaths in London caused by the enemy.<br />
<br />
</em>Remember to a liberal it's all our fault.<br />
<br />We should fight " A more sensitive war", as John Kerry said.<br />
<br />We should spend more money on Homeland Security says New York Senator Hillary Clinton after the London bombing, just as her state is in the process of returning millions of dollars unused for Homeland Security.<br />
<br />We should not use this latest attack to "profile" middle eastern men says the liberal press. (I guess they think having grandma take of her shoes in an airport is a smart way to stop terrorism.)<br />
<br />Liberals want to take down George W. Bush any way they can. And they HATE the fact that this London bombing reminds every American why they voted for him---President Bush knows what liberals do not.<br />
<br />This is World War IV.<br />
<br />In Matworld World War IV is fought by any means needed.<br />
<br />We round up the terrorists and they get no court dates, no Koran, no fancy food.<br />We use the oil money from Iraq to ESCALATE the War On Terror into Syria where Saddam's weapons of mass destruction went and from where the terrorists in Iraq are coming from.<br />We stop ALL middle eastern men in airports, bus terminals, train stations and public events and ask for I.D. and purpose for being there.<br />We help England and Europe stop the invasion of Muslim extremists that is threatening the free world.<br />
<br />This is World War IV.<br />
<br />Let's start fighting it like we know that it is.<br />
