<p class="MsoNormal">Americaâs greatest Big Top Circus (ya know, the one in the white building on Capitol Hill) was at it again last week as indignant Senators pointed fingers at the whipping boy du jour, ex-FEMA Director Michael Brown, regarding the never-ending Hurricane Katrina crisis. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">As this regrettable dog and pony show (too many dogs, not enough ponies) played out, it occurred to me that we here at The Dick List have been unusually silent concerning the aftermath of Katrina. I decided to offer some observations that will probably make members of the Mainstream Media run directly to their Upper West Side therapists. Hurricane Katrina has been fucked six ways from Sunday, now its time to put this bitch to bed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<strong>Observation 1: Disasters happen</strong>. The Chicago Fire, the 1917-18 flu epidemic, the 1906 San Francisco Earthquake... sometimes man and all his toys are subject to the whims of God (or Earth Mother Gaia for all you Atheists) .</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sure when it comes to Hurricanes meteorologists can try to predict the path, but a prediction is hardly a guarantee. Remember there was a sense of relief in New Orleans after the storm passed. The fact is that no one could say with any certainty what the aftermath of the event would be. The usual suspects accused the Bush Administration of acting "too slowly" and "not leading" (meaning Bush should have taken Pre-Emptive control of the situation), but I strongly doubt any hands-on approach would have gone over too well in MSM/DNC land. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I'm sure President Bush superceeding the authority of a black democratic mayor and a female democratic governor by sending ten thousand Virginia farm boys carrying automatic rifles to drag Big Mama Lickabooboo out of her home while she screams âYou cainât take mah houseâ into every news camera within 100 miles would have appeased the leftists among us....</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">ABC, NBC, CBS and the New York Times would have given him a pass, right (you know, for the good of the people....)?<br />

<p class="MsoNormal">Emboldened by their unwavering sense of moral superiority, the Eurofags and their ass-buddies in American liberal intelligentsia have all screeched down from their Ivory Towers about how the Federal Government (or Feddie Gov if you are from the hood) failed the people of New Orleans. Iâd say the people of New Orleans failed themselves. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<strong>Observation 2: Large Federal Goverments suck at everything</strong>. For Europeans, the government has replaced religion as the opiate of the masses; consequently they viewed the Katrina situation through a prizm of government failure. Had a similar catastrophe occurred in a country like France, Jacques Chirac surely would have donned a cape and swooped from the heavens to save the proletariat (or so they would believe). You see, Eurofags do not understand the American view of limited federal interference in everyday life; they see the Government as their most important protector and provider. In many ways the welfare state of New Orleans most resembles the European social model: high unemployment, low productivity, and the inescapable stench of decay. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Realistically, the Federal Government is an inefficient behemoth. It is slow, unwieldy, and mired in bureaucracy. Was the Feddie Govâs reaction perfect? Nope. Will it ever be perfect? Nope. If your only plans for surviving a disaster is to rely on the Feddie Gov (and I don't care if you live in Europe, America, or Antartica), then you probably ate lead paint chips along with your Captain Crunch when you were a kid. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The fact is that the poverty stricken people of New Orleans lived in government housing, received Government food subsidies, and government welfare checks. Shockingly, all these factors created a class of people devoid of self-reliance. Go figure. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">âThe gubâment will save me.<span> </span>They always send mah check on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 15<sup>th</sup>, why should I walk da ten miles out the city? Iâm helpless.â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For leftists, federal money is the universal solution to all the problems that can arise in society. Because the government always uses proper accounting and poor people are noble, wise, and judicious with their spending, why wouldnât one just shovel loads of cash into the region and give the people endless support?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After all, <span>i</span>ts not like people would use federal handouts to buy sex toys, alcohol, firearms, lap dances, or pay off an outstanding bail bond... except that they did all of those things.<br />

<p class="MsoNormal">Of course the Mainstream Media deserves a boot in the ass for its serpentine excuse making for the Democratic âleadershipâ of New Orleans. Governor Kathleen Blanco and Senator Mary Landrieu can both turn on the old waterworks, and Brian (Honorary Belgian) Williams will give them a copy of Doctor Philâs new book âHow not to be a dumb bitchâ and speak at length about their "courage". </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And last but not least, letâs not forget Mayor Ray Nagin.... a man who can ride the Hershey Highway all the way to Chocolate City and come out squeaky clean on the other side. <span>

<strong>Observation 3: The population of New Orleans are disgusting fatbodies</strong>. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I usually shrug off news of the obesity epidemic in America; generally I think the numbers can be tweaked too easily to be taken seriously. The video from New Orleans, however, may have convinced me otherwise as there were too many jubbly lard-asses to count! This may explain why the city is sinking. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">These fucking people fell to pieces after a day without food when they could live for months off the fat stores on there ankles alone. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
<strong>Observation 4: Black "leaders" are a bunch of con-men</strong>. Although you can't expect the Mainstream Media to criticize anyone who isnât a White Christian, it would be nice if Black Leaders were willing to address a couple of the glaring issues to emerge from this catastrophe. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Black leaders all levied criticism against Bush concerning the income disparity between blacks and whites in New Orleans. This problem didnât occur overnight, yet you didnât hear shit from these people during the Clinton Administration or over the last forty-years for that matter. </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It strikes me that these black leaders seem like nothing more than race hustlers who dutifully parrot DNC talking points and/or traffic in unfounded conspiracy theories about how the CIA blew up the levees to kill poor black people. Why would the CIA even bother?<br />

</a> <p class="MsoNormal">My Conclusions:</p>
<ul type="disc">
<li class="MsoNormal">FEMA head Michael Brown - Usual over-his-head political appointee. How did Congress approve his nomination 98-0?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Federal Government - Worked as well as possible. Thatâs not a compliment.</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">State Government - M.I.A. </li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Local Government â Typical of a big city when Democrats run it; Corrupt leaders, hostile to law enforcement, poorly run public works, overburdened with huge welfare rolls. Why do you think people were calling for Rudy Giuliani to come and take charge?</li>
<li class="MsoNormal">Military â Progress only began when Lt. General Honore showed up with the 82<sup>nd</sup> Airborne. Give the Military more power to take charge of these situations and quit your Bush whimpering.</li>
</ul> Tomorrow: What does New Orleans look like today?</div>
