<a href="http://www.feastoffools.net">Feast of Fools</a> - # 181 - <strong>The Afterglow of Kiki and Herb</strong> - 40min - Fausto and Victoria and some of the other FoF stars went to see <a href="http://www.kikiandherb.com/">Kiki and Herb</a> and then talked to the stars and their fans.  We join in after the show.  Fausto was influenced by Justin (kiki).  Victoria auditioned to be Justin's understudy.  Why does Fausto admire Kiki and Herb?  This was a Chicago debut of the duo.  Where is Kiki off to next?  He's working on both sides of the Atlantic these days.  How do Justin and Kenny (Herb) prepare for their performances?  What is success?  How does it feel?  Justin does whatever Kenny says.  Switch.  Outside with the fans now.  Do you agree with Kiki about his criticism of the catholic church?  Another fan used to pray to be straight.  What is everybody going to be for halloween?  What does halloween mean?<br />

<a href="http://www.luckybitchradio.com">Lucky Bitch Radio</a> - # 152 - <strong>Threat of the Lipscalper</strong> - 48min - The Lipscalper opens the show - sounds none too nice.  Little gassy, little bloated today... Wanda is.  Happy hallowanda week!  If Wanda had lived 200 years ago, she probably would have been burned at the stake.  Censorship in the internet age.  Article about Yahoo turning over info on chinese dissient to the Chinese government.  Short history on China.  Who scares Wanda?  Hillary vs Condalezzie in 2008.  Grey and chilly in Golden Valley.  Nordic studs in college.  Stop and enjoy the moment please.  How is gold mined?<br />

<a href="http://www.dtwfpodcast.com/">Drink 'til We're Funny</a> - # 7 - <strong>A Weekend in Wisconsin, 18 Hour Bras and Shirtless College Boys</strong> - 39min -  This is the first podcast where drinks were had before the show.  Eighteen hour bra is not true.  Rolling Meadows is not boys town.  Easy way to figure out who's who.  New audio setup (yes I noticed and it sounds much better).  I hear my name and a plug for <a href="http://www.podcastsoup.net">podcastsoup.net</a>.  Hot guys with hairy chests, lounging by the pool.  Sleeping on Deens'a boobies, they are memory boobies.  Shoutouts to listeners.  Voicemails.  FUPA.  Who made out with who's brother.  Switch.  The crew is now outside bars in White Water Wisconsin.  Boobies and cock flashing.  Put the lotion in the basket.  Deena fingers some guy's ass crack.<br />
