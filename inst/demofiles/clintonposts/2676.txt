<div><p>Among those on offer for the US presidency in 2008:</p>

<ul><li><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2141424/">Rudy Giuliani</a> (described by the very angry author of that piece as "an abominable human being"; oh, and if anyone can figure out what the <em>hell</em> the point of the little anecdote in the last paragraph of the article is (other than that the author has some odd melanin issues), please feel free to let me know)</li>

<li><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2141639/">Hillary Clinton</a> (a truly bizarre piece which offers a paranoiac inquiry into why so many Republicans are convinced that Hillary will be the Democrat nominee, then goes on to list, in detail, exactly why she's almost certain to be the candidate - and then concludes that the Republicans are up to something nefarious in describing her nomination as a certainty)</li></ul></div>
