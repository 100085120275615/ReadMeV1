It's been a while since something in Salon sent me into a furious, sputtering rage, so I suppose I should be proud of myself for remaining calm and collected for so long, rather than wonder why I've gotten so worked up over a parenthetical in an otherwise perfectly fine book review.  This time, it's a review of the <a href="http://www.salon.com/books/review/2006/08/12/gellhorn/"> letters of Martha Gellhorn</a>, a journalist who rubbed elbows with the Roosevelts and married Ernest Hemingway.  Her letters, like those of, say, Thomas Jefferson, seem refreshingly complex and well-written, an art that's largely been lost in today's bloggy world.  So, by all means, sing her praises, and the praises of the lost epistolatory arts, to the heavens.  But why, oh dear Jesus eating egg rolls why does Stephen Amidon have to throw this bit in about Gellhorn's pen-pal Eleanor Roosevelt: "Her letters from Spain to Eleanor Roosevelt are among the book's most memorable (and its saddest, as it is doubtful that our current first lady cultivates similarly provocative and <br />enriching correspondents)."<br /><br />What the fuck?  Can't Salon publish one article on any subject matter without fitting in an <em> ad hominem</em> attack on the President, a member of his Cabinet or his wife?  Yes, I doubt very much that Laura Bush writes, or receives, such letters.  But neither did Hillary Clinton and neither would Tereas Heinz Kerry.  People don't write these letters anymore.  Especially not politicians.<br /><br />But there's something else troubling here that Mr. Amidon may not even have noticed.  The Bush Administration <em> has</em> developed very friendly relationships with journalists.  From giving Tony Snow a job in the White House to paying journalists to write favorable editorials on major pieces of the policy agenda, this Administration has worked overtime to develop just the kinds of relationships Eleanor Roosevelt did in the 1930s.  Yes, Gellhorn was Roosevelt's friend, but she was also a journalist.  These days, Salon publishes searing articles attacking the President for corrupting journalism by issuing a press-pass to a right-wing male hooker.  Eleanor Roosevelt lets her left-wing female paramour (and journalist) live in the White House.  She writes intimate letters to journalists working in Spain at a time when her husband was hardly uninvolved in the policy issues emanating from the Spanish Civil War.<br /><br />This kind of intimacy between politicians and journalists isn't new now and wasn't new then.  Thomas Jefferson created an imaginary job in the State Department for a journalist who ran a paper attacking President Washington and Alexander Hamilton.  I don't want to really get into a discussion of whether or not these relationships are appropriate, or whether or not Roosevelt's correspondence with friends who were also journalists is ethically similar to paying journalists to write the party line, but there's no way to deny that both Gellhorn and Roosevelt benefitted professionally from their relationship.  If Laura Bush were writing letters on matters of policy to modern-day Martha Gellhorns and Salon found out you can be assured they'd point to it as further evidence of corruption at the highest levels of both politics and journalism.  Because at Salon, Bush just can't catch a break, but Eleanor Roosevelt could have led a cabal of child murdering cannibals and still be praised for her courage and vision.<br /><br />And that, my friends, is bullshit.<br /><br />PS: The actual quote they give from Gellhorn's letter to Roosevelt [my understanding is that the letters in reverse are not published, at least in this volume, which is in itself a sad thing] is really beautiful, and a bit haunting knowing what we know happened in Spain:<br /><blockquote>This country is far too beautiful for the Fascists to have it. They have already made Germany and Italy and Austria so loathsome that even the scenery is inadequate, and every time I drive on the roads here and see the rock mountains and the tough terraced fields, and the umbrella pines above the beaches, and the dust colored villages and the gravel river beds and the peasant's faces, I think: Save Spain for decent people, it's too beautiful to waste.</blockquote><br />PPS: Her snarling, acid take down of her narcissitic husband is also brilliant.  Here she is writing to a friend upon the publication of Hemingway's "Across The River and Into the Trees":<br /><blockquote>I feel quite sick, I cannot describe this to you. Shivering sick. I watch him adoring his image, with such care and such tolerance and such accuracy in detail ... I weep for the eight years I spent ... worshipping his image with him, and I weep for whatever else I was cheated of due to that time-serving.</blockquote>
