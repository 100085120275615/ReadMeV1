<br />You know that scene in Pulp Fiction? After Jules and Vincent show up to their buddy's house with a dead body?<br />
<br />
<pre>                                  JULES<br />                   I don't wanna hear about no<br />                   motherfuckin' "ifs."  What I wanna<br />                   hear from your ass is: "you ain't<br />                   got no problems, Jules.  I'm on the<br />                   motherfucker.  Go back in there,<br />                   chill them niggers out and wait for<br />                   the cavalry, which should be comin'<br />                   directly."<br />
<br />                              MARSELLUS<br />                   You ain't got no problems, Jules.<br />                   I'm on the motherfucker.  Go back<br />                   in there, chill them niggers out<br />                   and wait for The Wolf, who should<br />                   be comin' directly.<br />
<br />                              JULES<br />                   You sendin' The Wolf?<br />
<br />                              MARSELLUS<br />                   Feel better?<br />
<br />                              JULES<br />                   Shit Negro, that's all you had to<br />                   say.</pre>Well, that's what Hillary Clinton did this week, when she sent Howard Wolfson to work with the Lamont campaign. Because while it isn't clear to people is outside New York politics who this guy is, it is crystal clear to people inside the game.<br />

<blockquote>
<br />
<a href="http://www.drummajorinstitute.org/events/unique_event.php?ID=38">HOWARD WOLFSON</a> serves as a Partner at The Glover Park Group and heads the firm's New York office. He joined GPG after serving as Executive Director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) for two years. At the DCCC, he oversaw advertising in over 40 media markets and was responsible for a $50 million budget. He also provided strategic, political and campaign advice on a daily basis to all Democratic House members.<br />
<br />Prior to the DCCC, Wolfson served as Communications Director for the campaign of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2000. He traveled extensively with Clinton throughout New York State and managed the campaign's research, policy and communications departments. During the campaign he made numerous television appearances on shows including Meet the Press, This Week and Larry King Live.<br />
<br />Wolfson was Communications Director for then Representative Charles Schumer's 1998 Senate campaign, developing and implementing extensive political, advertising and press strategies. He had previously served as Chief of Staff and Press Secretary to Representative Nita Lowey.<br />
<br />Wolfson graduated from the University of Chicago and subsequently earned a Masters in US History from Duke University. A New York native, he now splits his time between New York and Washington, DC, with his wife Terri.</blockquote>He's a no bullshit kinda guy and Dan Gerstein is seriously overmatched. And he has solid insider creds without being a Washington guy. When he started with the Schumer campaign, nobody gave him a chance of beating D'Amato. By the time they finished, D'Amato lost by 10 points.<br />
<br />I don't know if I'd want him running ALL the campaigns, but in a close in fight, he's a proven winner, one of the few around in Dem consultant circles. And in this region, it sends a clear signal that the bullshit is over, Hillary is on Lamont's team and people better join up.</div>
