<div>After having their "Culture of Corruption" meme discredited, Democrats are onto a new meme. "Dangerously incompetent" is their latest creation. It isn't off to a good start, either. Here's Dingy Harry Reid <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188842,00.html" target="_blank">trying to sell that meme</a>:<br />
<blockquote>"Where is (Secretary of State) Condoleezza Rice? Why isn't she over in the Middle East, as the chief diplomat of this country should be, trying to get the political forces to form a government over there?" Reid told The Associated Press. Reid said the U.S. was "failing three different ways in Iraq." Military efforts have lagged, the economy is crippled by decreased oil and electricity production, and attempts to form a representative government are behind schedule, he said.</blockquote>This is why liberals aren't sitting in the Oval Office. This is why liberals aren't credible on national security. In the 'good old days', Al Gore was the 'Demogogue-in-Chief'. Now that Democrats don't occupy the White House, they've split up that 'responsibility'. They've now unofficially split those duties between Dingy Harry, Nancy Pelosi, John Murtha and Hillary.<br />
<br />This meme will be as 'effective' as the "Culture of Corruption" meme was. In other words, people are likely already tuning this out. While I'm on the subject, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2006/03/22/BL2006032200400.html" target="_blank">Howard Kurtz</a> said "I think we've reached a point where much of the country has tuned out Bush." That's entirely possible, though I don't believe it. What isn't being said, though, is that people are tuning out Democratic demogogues like Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi and John Murtha. Worse, their daily diatribes aren't being taken seriously.<br />
<br />People who take their news-gathering seriously don't take Reid, Murtha and Pelosi seriously. Their jingo-a-day attitude isn't selling. Serious people see this as nothing more than a gimmick.<br />
<br />I mean, does anyone think that Condi isn't on top of what's happening? Furthermore, does anyone who's followed Iraq's recovery think that Zal Khalilzad isn't all over Iraq's political, economic and reconstruction situations? Reid's saying "dangerously incompetent" isn't taken seriously because it isn't even remotely based on the truth. Harry's probably convinced that the daily pollitorials saying that people aren't satisfied with President Bush's handling of the war in Iraq. The thing is that quite a few conservatives wish he'd be even more aggressive in hunting down the insurgents.<br />
