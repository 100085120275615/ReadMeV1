<p>On arts, smarts, and bloggin&#8217; about bloggin&#8217; about bloggin&#8217; (a.k.a., &#8220;Mo&#8217; Meta Blues&#8221;) &#8230;</p>
	<p>1. You&#8217;re right <a href="http://sixfive.net" target="_blank">Josh</a>, this really <i>is</i> the <a href="http://www.jacksonpollock.org/" target="_blank">coolest site ever</a>. Now give me the keys to the Vespa for the weekend (moms&#8217;ll be here soon!)</p>
	<p>2. You&#8217;re right <a href="http://teendrama.com" target="_blank">Dens</a>, this really <i>is</i> the <a href="http://abum.com/file/shadow/animations/17632.swf" target="_blank">coolest Flash animation ever</a>. Now give me the keys to the Vermont house for the weekend.</p>
	<p>3. Gonz the Great is featured in a recent issue of <a href="http://vman.com/" target="_blank">VMAN Magazine</a>. Just walk over to the right about seven or eight clicks; he falls in somewhere after that Josh Hartnett fella. (<a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jeawf/" target="_blank">Jess</a>, sorry I didn&#8217;t post your comment yesterday but we have one rule around here: Don&#8217;t slag the Gonz!)</p>
	<p>4. &#8220;Think about Bill. You can see him talking to Hillary one minute, then ducking into his study to take Gore&#8217;s call and advise him on how to beat her. He&#8217;s Clinton, you know &#8212; he just can&#8217;t help himself.&#8221;<br />
<i>&#8211;An &#8220;old Clinton hand&#8221; on how Slick Willie would roll if Gore stepped to Hillary for the dem slot in &#8216;08 (from a <a href="http://newyorkmetro.com/news/politics/17065/index.html" target="_blank">highly readable Al Gore feature</a> in </i>New York<i> magazine)</i>.</p>
	<p>5. My first VH1 byline &#8212; an <a href="http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1533829/20060607/story.jhtml" target="_blank">interview with spunky Scot KT Tunstall</a>. Should have more on the way. Also, if anyone happens to be using <a href="http://www.urge.com/" target="_blank">URGE</a>, I&#8217;m the VH1 Informer. <a href="http://blogs.indiewire.com/tully/" target="_blank">Mike</a>, I kicked to your site yesterday. Expect a <i>serious</i> (read: 14 visits) spike in traffic.
