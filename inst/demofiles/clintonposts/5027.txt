The unions gave him big points for that. But he only voted against it after it was clear his vote was meaningless. Here's another, particularly cynical one: he co-sponsored an act giving more collective bargaining rights to health-care professionals, and then he voted against it in the middle of the night. He also once sponsored a pro-labor bill and then refused to sign the discharge petition to get it considered. But he got points on the scorecards by these actions. <p>His score is still low (around 40% as opposed to Hillary Clinton's or Chuck <span class="hm" id="misp_compose_5">Schumer's</span> 90), but it's fairly high for a Republican. So the belief goes ... labor has to support him because it needs friends on the other side of the aisle to work for compromises in legislation. And here you can start to see the echoes of Joe Lieberman. They need to be "bipartisan," they need to extend hands to the GOP to get things done. And, in a normal time, I'd applaud that. I am all for cooperation and putting partisan labels aside.</p><p>But this is not a normal time, and it's missing that central fact that puts all the "insiders" on the wrong side of the key issues of our time, that gives them the totally wrong impression of what's going on in the Lieberman/Lamont race. The Republican Party of Tom Delay, of John <span class="hm" id="misp_compose_6">Boehner</span>, of Bill <span class="hm" id="misp_compose_7">Frist</span>, of George W. Bush and Karl Rove ... this is not a party designed to govern in the 20th century sense, this is not a party that is interested in the give-and-take of legislative horse-trading to get the best possible outcome. This is not even a Republican Party that many traditional Republicans could really believe in. This is a party that is bent on bending the federal government completely to its vision, that has a radical view of reshaping American society and the world in a totally different image. The truth of this is obvious to anyone outside the Beltway, but it seems completely to have escaped the centralized political and media structures that dominate our discourse. Or, at best, it's only just beginning to dawn on them.</p></blockquote><span>On top of that, restaurant workers in the states of Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington would actually get a pay cut </span><a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/pm114">because of the way the House bill is written</a><span>.
