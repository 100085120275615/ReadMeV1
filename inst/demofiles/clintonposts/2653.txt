<div><p><span>I.&nbsp; Welfare Reform Plus Ten</span></p>

<p><span>Those with keen historical memories will recall the liberals' misplaced emphasis when President Clinton signed the 1996 welfare form bill.&nbsp; The quaint and largely forgotten notion that work is the most reliable guarantor of success was overlooked by the left for the more politically rich vein which they conveniently, if cynically exploited.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>Three Clinton appointees resigned, and Georgia Congressman John Lewis, perhaps the most predictable touchstone of reflexive liberalism, shrieked:</span></p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span>They're coming for the children.&nbsp; They're coming for the poor.&nbsp; They're coming for the sick, the elderly, and the disabled.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The normally level-headed Senator Patrick Moynihan was overtaken by a fever that clouded his judgment when he characterized the reform as &quot;something approaching an apocalypse.&quot;&nbsp; Of course, Mr. Clinton himself, who twice vetoed similar reform bills, was dragged kicking and screaming to the table.</span></p>

<p><span>Ten years later, the interim results are in and although you won't hear any mea culpas from the liberals, the results are rather different than the picture of Dickensian disaster they painted.&nbsp; The rate of black children living in poverty is 32%, down nearly ten percent from 1996.&nbsp; The percent of lower-income people who are employed and working their way, albeit slowly, up the economic ladder has increased as well.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>Our values informs our culture and our politicians primary responsibility is to reform our values by instituting public policies that realign incentives to encourage independence, hard work, and a fair playing field.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>The Republican-led welfare reform bill did just that, and it has clearly improved the lives of millions who were leading unproductive lives while transferring those flawed values to yet another generation.&nbsp; The process is by no means complete, but meaningful progress has clearly been made.</span></p>

<p><span>II.&nbsp; 'Plan B':&nbsp; Another Step Backward</span></p>

<p><span>Leaders of Planned Parenthood hailed the FDA's approval of the so-called morning-after pill as a seminal victory, saying it could prevent 1.5 million unintended pregnancies and 800,000 abortions.</span></p>

<p><span>Taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse, Plan B is tantamount to an extremely high dose of birth-control pills.&nbsp; The resulting surge of hormones interferes with ovulation and fertilization, or it may potentially prevent implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus.</span></p>

<p><span>Although the medical community doesn't believe this constitutes abortion, not all agree.&nbsp; But there is a more fundamental and therefore more profound issue here, one that has generally eluded scrutiny by liberals who gleefully touted the decision as yet another advance towards their goal of achieving heaven on earth.</span></p>

<p><span>To appreciate the substrata of this issue we begin with the disparity between liberals and conservatives with respect to the meaning of human life.&nbsp; Although we must minimize the trauma and distortion of reducing such complex differences into mundane terms, it ultimately comes down to whether or not one believes that our <em>raison d'etre</em> here on earth is to maximize our pleasure and minimize our accountability.&nbsp; Liberals generally endorse this polity, conservatives generally don't.</span></p>

<p><span>Indeed, if the design and intent of our time on earth is self-defined, which is to say purely a matter of secular pragmatism, then our primary motivation and goal is to submerse ourselves in the pursuit of physical pleasure.&nbsp; Although it's a cravenly solipsistic philosophy, in the past 40 years our cultural incentives have been dramatically reconfigured to encourage that very behavior.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>But if our existence is the product of a divine force, something that as humans we have no capacity to understand but that expresses itself in the oblique and tangential manifestation of our religious yearnings<em>--id est</em>, faith--then raw sexual satisfaction sans inconvenient consequences--read pregnancy--is the antithesis of our first and most crucual obligation.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>In that case, Plan B and the entire panoply of liberalism's broad denial of absolutes that provides for them a blanket endorsement of all things earthly and ephemeral, are themselves obstacles to our moral development.</span></p>

<p><span>The contrasting vision is one where moral discipline and principle are paramount, where delayed gratification and self-sacrifice are virtues that provide exponential value in ways not readily apparent to those focused only on the momentary satisfaction of our mortal desires.</span></p>

<p><span>The liberals may claim a victory in their grand design to create a civic and cultural landscape free from morality and principle, but in truth the approval of Plan B is simply another insult to our collective moral foundation. </span></p>

<p><span>That foundation was established as a powerful and resilient framework which, until this generation, was successfully transferred through the decades and centuries, and which strengthened people by helping them understand that life's real meaning lies in adhering to God's plan, which enjoins us to selflessly work for the betterment of future generations, not in finding ways to short-circuit the heavy moral lifting that work demands of us.</span></p>

<p><span>III.&nbsp; The Phantom Nature of Sanctions</span></p>

<p><span>That the hopelessly fragile coalition at the U.N. is already starting to fray should not be a surprise to anyone.&nbsp; France, always a predictably inconstant partner in any conflict, has begun sending signals of its reticence to impose meaningful sanctions when--not if--Iran continues its uranium enrichment program.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>A tandem response from Russia's Defense Minister telegraphed a similar insistence to allow the &quot;political and diplomatic solution&quot; to be fully engaged.&nbsp; China has also sent diffident signals after its initial willingness to consider meaningful sanctions.</span></p>

<p><span>To its credit, the U.S. is working on a parallel process to ensure that some form of sanctions is in place shortly after the August 31st deadline.&nbsp; Although it won't, that process should include a provision that any state violating Security Council Resolution 1540, which prohibits the transfer of nuclear weapons to terrorists, would constitute a threat to international peace and security under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter--that would lead to authority for military action.</span></p>

<p><span>In quintessential French parlance, which features an unqualified disdain of confrontation and a naive belief in the sincerity of such liars as Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, its Foreign Minister, Philippe Douste-Blazy, said that although Iran's initial response is unsatisfactory, </span></p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span>...we want to avoid a new conflict that could lead to a clash of civilizations.&nbsp; The worst thing would be to escalate into a confrontation with Iran on the one hand, and the Muslim world with Iran, and the West.&nbsp; That would be the clash of the civilizations that France today is practically alone in trying to avoid.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>Those schooled in the ingeniously nuanced pre-WWII diplomatic efforts of the French and British will recognize in this expose a similarly quiet desperation at the very thought of confrontation.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>This approach is actually a faithful blueprint of Israeli PM Olmert's, who provided a textbook example of strategic myopia, by first failing to understand the enemy and then, logically, prosecuting the wrong war.&nbsp; The only thing worse than aggressively confronting an enemy is waiting until that enemy has coalesced into a more robust and lethal foe, because then the challenge is multiplied, as are the losses.</span></p>

<p><span>But many, perhaps most, in the U.S. and much of the world, seem predisposed to let this baleful enemy gather its strength, to include a crude nuclear capability, at which point we will yearn for such comforting strategic conventions as Mutual Assured Destruction.</span></p>

<p><span>IV.&nbsp; Saddam's Genocide</span></p>

<p><span>Last week, those more inclined to focus on the lack of WMD stockpiles in Iraq than on Saddam's crimes of genocide were treated to gruesome testimony of his Anfal campaign of 1987-88 against the Kurds.&nbsp; During that horrendous attack some tens of thousands are alleged to have been gassed and some 2,000 villages completely decimated.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>How anyone can feel that the Middle East specifically and the world in general isn't better off without this savage despot in power strains the imagination.&nbsp; For transparent political reasons, many on the left seem to minimize the barbarity of Saddam whose brutal crimes against humanity are in the same genus as those of Hitler and Stalin.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>Iraq's current state is unquestionably a major challenge for the civilized world, but one can use it as a proxy for the degree to which politics plays a role in one's calculus.&nbsp; Liberals instinctively smell political blood and call it a failure, conservatives can't help but admit that it's a dire situation but they see the potential for an inchoate form of democratic rule as the best hope for long-term stability in the Middle East.&nbsp; Toppling and bringing to justice the butcher of Baghdad is a good beginning.</span></p>

<p><span>V.&nbsp; Sexual Assaults at The Citadel</span></p>

<p><span>The Citadel, the previously all-male military institution, declared that 20 percent of its female cadets reported being sexually assaulted.&nbsp; Ten or more years ago, this and many other arms of our military were under intense pressure to admit women into their ranks.&nbsp; Feminists argued that women had a Constitutional right to every opportunity that men enjoyed and for them these bastions of unalloyed testosterone represented the Holy Grail.</span></p>

<p><span>Not unlike the goal of integrating women into all branches of the military proper, their arguments here were predicated on the twofold and supremely misguided notion that women were as equipped for warfare as men and that any adverse impacts from mandating their inclusion would be minimal and short-lived.&nbsp; Both were, of course, categorically incorrect.</span></p>

<p><span>&quot;Different&quot; in the view of the feminists and their liberal brethren is an unacceptable premise because they ineluctably interpret it as inferior.&nbsp; But, in order to accommodate them in our armed services the entire gamut of entrance requirements and training strandards had to be fundamentally revamped--downward.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>Second, and inextricably related, is the evidence, which is so abundant as to be impossible to avoid, that on a scale of capacity for violence and aggression, men are naturally at its zenith and women at its nadir.&nbsp; The sole charge of our military is to defend our nation and to win wars.&nbsp; Their inherent aggressiveness and physical aptitude naturally argues for men to assume this role, but politics being what it is and our culture being what <em>it</em> is, liberalism prevailed.</span></p>

<p><span>So now we're confronted with what most on the right considered inevitable and those on the left apparently find shocking--the high rate of sexual assaults at our military academies.&nbsp; Rules, ethics, and the stringent code of military conduct are vital training tools but they are no match for the base genetic code deeply ingrained in our very core.&nbsp; That code is only marginally susceptible to modification which is why men are as close to the perfect killing machine as we can get.</span></p>

<p><span>In the misguided spirit of political correctness and the goal of 'gender equality' women are now in virtually every position in our military which were exclusively reserved for men.&nbsp; The result, in our military as well as our in the ranks of law enforcement, is not only rampant sexual assaults but a compromised fighting capacity.</span></p>

<p><span>VI.&nbsp; Death of a Photojournalist</span></p>

<p><span>Most Americans would probably not recognize the name of Joe Rosenthal.&nbsp; His photograph of the U.S. Marines of the 28th Regiment of the 5th&nbsp; Division that raised the American flag atop Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima on February 23, 1945 won him the Pulitzer Prize.</span></p>

<p><span>But in a generational lesson as well as one for photographers and all those whose creative abilities are artistically applied, the thought that this image would become an American icon never occurred to him:</span></p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span>Out of the corner of my eye, I had seen the men start the flag up.&nbsp; I swung my camera and shot the scene.&nbsp; When you take a picture like that, you don't come away saying you got a great shot.&nbsp; You don't know.</span></p></blockquote><p><span>The Marines had landed on February 19 and it took four days for a contingent to scale the mountain.&nbsp; In a lesson for those who believe that victory can be prescribed (read in Iraq), more than 6,800 U.S. servicemen died in the five-week battle for control over the island; further, the 21,000-man Japanese defense force was virtually destroyed.</span></p>

<p><span>The horrors of that conflict momentarily aside, one can't help be struck by the unified sense of determination that the image projects, not to mention the sacrifice it took for them to achieve success.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>We are clearly in a different kind of war, both in Iraq, as well as our broader war against the Islamofascists, and there is no question that ours is not unified nation against this enemy because many fail to recognize it.&nbsp; There are many reasons, all of which are mired in a moral confusion as well as our cultural reticence to judge a religion, even one that champions death over life.</span></p>

<p><span>But that doesn't diminish or inhibit the threat, and indeed, it may provide it with a strategic advantage that we can ill-afford because since it operates outside the parameters of any nominally recognized international law, it already enjoys a profound advantage.</span></p>

<p><span>We can only hope and pray that it won't take another major attack on our nation for our Republic to become unified in the spirit of self-preservation.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>VII.&nbsp; The Poincare Conjecture Solved</span></p>

<p><span>Reclusive Russian mathematician Grigory Perelman won the coveted Fields Award, the math world's highest honor, for solving the 100 year old three-dimensional conundrum known as Poincare's Conjecture.</span></p>

<p><span>The conjecture dictates that in three dimensions you cannot transform a doughnut shape into a sphere without ripping it, although any shape without a hold can be stretched or shrunk into a sphere.&nbsp; The challenge is that the space has to be finite.&nbsp; The traditional example is an insect walking on a straight line on an apple--it will inevitably return to its beginning.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>Although the apple has three dimensions its surface has only two.&nbsp; The insect can walk backward, forward, and sideways--but not up and down.&nbsp; Ironically, a similarly conjecture was proved for spaces of more than three dimensions, but the 3-D case has vexed mathematicians for two decades--until Mr. Perleman.</span></p>

<p><span>His success begins with Columbia University's Richard Hamilton, who, in 1982 developed a technique called Ricci flow, which provided mathematical computations that smoothed the unpredictable surfaces of 3-D surfaces and which provided the clues for solving the conjecture.</span></p>

<p><span>In this convoluted mix are dense spots called singularities, which exhibit precipitous and uncontrolled change.&nbsp; Mr.&nbsp; Perelman's work demonstrated not only how to understand these singularities but how to neutralize them for brief periods which allowed the Ricci flow to move forward, which defined the precise nature of a particular space, at least in the mathematician's abstruse world, which in this case, means in topological terms.&nbsp; </span></p>
