<div>On Tuesday, the U.S. Senate failed to send a Constitutional amendment to the states that would have made it unconstitutional to disgrace the American flag.<br />
<br />Here is a list of the Senate bastards who, exhibiting a now familiar Senate posture of hating America, voted against the proposed amendment. Perhaps some will choose to write or phone these dastardly excuses for Senators and express their contempt. They all richly deserve to be trampled and spit upon.<br />
<br />The 34 anti-flag Senators:<br />NAYs â34<br />Akaka (D-HI)<br />Bennett (R-UT)<br />Biden (D-DE)<br />Bingaman (D-NM)<br />Boxer (D-CA)<br />Byrd (D-WV)<br />Cantwell (D-WA)<br />Carper (D-DE)<br />Chafee (R-RI)<br />Clinton (D-NY)<br />Conrad (D-ND)<br />Dodd (D-CT)<br />Dorgan (D-ND)<br />Durbin (D-IL)<br />Feingold (D-WI)<br />Harkin (D-IA)<br />Inouye (D-HI)<br />Jeffords (I-VT)<br />Kennedy (D-MA)<br />Kerry (D-MA)<br />Kohl (D-WI)<br />Lautenberg (D-NJ)<br />Leahy (D-VT)<br />Levin (D-MI)<br />Lieberman (D-CT)<br />McConnell (R-KY)<br />Mikulski (D-MD)<br />Murray (D-WA)<br />Obama (D-IL)<br />Pryor (D-AR)<br />Reed (D-RI)<br />Sarbanes (D-MD)<br />Schumer (D-NY)<br />Wyden (D-OR)</div>
