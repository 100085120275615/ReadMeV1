Pretty boy Democrat Harold Ford Jr is a darling to the lefties in the upcoming election.  The prospect of him replacing Frist has salivating dems writing checks from New York to California.<br /><a href="http://photobucket.com" target="_blank"><img src="http://i14.photobucket.com/albums/a311/possum5/fordKeynote.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting" /></a><br />JUNIOR'S KEYNOTE <br /><br />In a recent article in the Chattanooga Times Free Press they endorsed Junior(much to the surprise of some guy living under a rock in Australia who knows nothing about the political stance of the Times Free Press).  Instead of writing the article themselves they asked a PR guy from Ford's office to do it for them.  Bear with me as my questions will make it worth it. Let's read it and confirm that suspicion:<br />*************************************<br />Harold Ford Jr. for U.S. Senate<br /><br />Rep. Harold Ford Jr., D-Tenn., is one of five candidates vying for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate, hoping, ultimately, to fill the seat of retiring Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn. Of the five, Rep. Ford is the most experienced, the most thoughtful and the most attuned to national issues. We recommend him as the Democratic standard-bearer in what promises to be one of the nation's most hotly contested U.S. Senate races of the fall.<br /><br />Rep. Ford, who has represented his West Tennessee district ably in the U.S. House since 1996, is a proven vote-getter. He's been returned to office four times by an average of 80 percent of the vote. The total is indicative of a wide appeal that transcends traditional party lines and voting patterns. <br /><br />Rep. Ford's attention to detail and understanding of the often arcane ways of the legislative branch make him an effective legislator. Moreover, a calm demeanor and refreshing willingness to work across party lines without sacrificing his party's ideals have made him a formidable presence in Congress. Those qualities, buttressed by his keen intellect and thoughtful stances on key national issues, validate his Senate candidacy.<br /><br />In a recent meeting with this newspaper's editorial board, Rep. Ford identified Iraq, immigration, health care, the energy shortage, the deficit and education as issues that must be resolved if citizens and the nation are to prosper. He is, of course, correct in that assessment, and his views on each are instructive.<br /><br />Rep. Ford voted for the Iraq war resolution but recognizes that the administration's war policies have gone terribly awry. Even so, he's opposed to an immediate pullout. He prefers a more measured approach that explores new policies to protect U.S. interests and lives while allowing Iraqis to build their own future. That's not a perfect answer but reflects the realities of a nasty, politicized war that continues to sap both the strength and treasury of the nation.<br /><br />His views on other pressing issues reflect a similar desire to focus on finding solutions rather than indulging in the finger-pointing that now passes for political debate in Congress. He would, for example, create incentives to improve vehicular fuel efficiency. He would couple them with increased research into the use of sun, wind, hydrogen and farm products as alternative sources of energy, rather than subsidize continued use of fossil fuel.<br /><br />Rep. Ford favors a balanced budget, health care initiatives that expand rather than reduce access, education policies that provide federal funding to cover federal mandates and an immigration policy that strengthens border controls and provides penalties for employers who hire undocumented workers.<br /><br />Generally, Rep. Ford's views reflect those of most centrist Democrats. The congressman rarely has deviated from that position during his public career. And while some Democrats might be troubled by his more conservative views on gun control, abortion, gay marriage and flag burning, he has been consistent on those issues as well. He's not changed long-held views to pander to a statewide electorate far more diverse than the voters in his congressional district.<br /><br />Rep. Ford has only token opposition in the primary and is expected to win the nomination handily. His real test will come in the November general election. There he'll face the winner of a bruising and divisive three-man GOP primary. Whatever the matchup in the fall, Rep. Ford will be a strong candidate. His possible opponents concede as much.<br /><br />Former Chattanooga Mayor Bob Corker has said, " ... he [Rep. Ford] will be a difficult candidate to beat." Ed Bryant has said, "Ford is formidable and should not be taken for granted." Both are correct.<br /><br />Tennessee Democrats, for the first time in recent election cycles, have the opportunity to nominate a strong, politically attractive candidate with a statewide constituency for U.S. Senate. We strongly endorse Rep. Ford for his party's nomination.<br />******************************<br /><br />Blah blah blah!  Someone convince me that whomever wrote this was employed by the paper and not actively working for the Ford campaign?  Ok, now that you survived that piece of yellow journalism let's ask some pertinent questions:<br /><br />I'm curious why we are so excited that the Times Free Press is endorsing Ford. That's kind of like saying we expect the sun to come up in a blue sky tomorrow isn't it? Have they ever endorsed a truly conservative candidate?<br /><br />Ford was for the war but is against how Bush is handling it: what exactly is his alternative plan since not pulling out is what is going to happen anyway?  What in his infinite 20/20 hindsight will fix the victory we have already acquired but are just mopping up?<br /><br />Energy situation: what has Ford voted in favor of in the past that would reduce the US dependency on foreign oil?  Even if we exponentially expanded alternative energy sources can we get away from oil in the next 100 years?  Heck no!<br /><br />Immigration: DUH> anyone disagree (besides Barbara Boxer)?<br /><br />Balanced Budget and Healthcare: As Tenncare has taught us, open access and controlled spending do not happen in tandem.  How does his plan rectify that with cutting taxes?<br /><br />Possibly outside of Van Hillary (sorry, that wasn't a nice joke) are any of the candidates stupid or is this glowing assertion of his intellect some kind of journalistic throwback to the racial mentality of the deep south (blacks aren't smart but great athletes).  In all deference to what I do believe is an intelligent candidate in Junior I must ask him: Do you assume your voters don't know about your liberal record, the facts about energy, and that you are blustering against Bush to pander for votes?
