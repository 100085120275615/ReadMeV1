<span>A Pro-Life group <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/nat1184.html">has asked for an audience</a> with Senator Clinton. This comes on the heels of a speech given last month in which the Senator advocated finding more "common ground" on the issue of abortion prevention.
<br />
<br />While most pro-life groups laughed at the idea that Senator was doing anything more than triangulating for a 2008 Presidential run, the Christian Defense Coalition is taking up the senator on the offer to find said common ground.
<br />
<br />In a letter sent to Clinton the groups said:</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>
<blockquote>
<span>"Senator Clinton, it is truly our hope that you were sincere in your desire to reach out to people of faith and the pro-life community. It would be very disappointing and troubling to discover your recent statements were motivated only by political posturing. Senator Clinton, a discussion with the pro-life community would help determine if you were sincere in your comments, or if you were attempting to reinvent yourself on the topic of abortion, to appear less radical."</span>
</blockquote>
</span>
<br />
<span>The group also has plans to approach the Senator's office to schedule a face to face.</span>
<br />

<br />
<span>HillaryWatch wishes them well in their lofty endeavors.</span>
