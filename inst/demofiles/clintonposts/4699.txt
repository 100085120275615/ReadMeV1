<p>One of the tactics of the rightwing noise machine is to find a way to blame Bill and/or Hillary Clinton for everything that happens, even though Clinton has been out of office for nearly 5 years now. Not surprisingly, one of the current talking points is that Bill Clinton didn&#8217;t reinforce New Orleans&#8217; levee system during his tenure in office. As a result of this shortcoming, the wingnuts posit, the disaster that is the Bush administration&#8217;s response to Hurricane Katrina is the fault of none other than Bill Clinton.</p>

	<p>It would have been nice if the levees had been reinforced during the Clinton adminstration. Whenever there is a discussion of priorities when it comes to funding such operations, however, one must realize that the questions asked are not whether or not the project should be undertaken, but rather which projects should be given priority. During the Clinton administration, the Corps of Engineers project was not given a priority sufficient to have caused it to be finished. It would, after all, have cost some 250 million dollars to complete.</p>

	<p>During the Bush administration, whether or not the project would be completed was still a matter of priorities. Among other things, the Iraq war was given a higher priority than the reinforcement of New Orleans&#8217; levees, as was the subsequent &#8220;reconstruction&#8221; effort undertaken in Iraq. So far, between the war and the reconstruction, the Bush administration has spent nearly 200 billion dollars. For one eighth of one percent of the cost of invading a country which posed absolutely no threat to the United States, the Bush administration could have finished reinforcing the New Orleans levee system.</p>
