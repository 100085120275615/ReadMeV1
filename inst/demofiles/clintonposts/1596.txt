<p>So, you&#8217;re saying that Joe Lieberman is a DINO because he puts his country ahead of his party?  If so, then he should wear the label with pride.  It distinguishes him from the AINOs (Americans In Name Only) on both sides of the isle who prefer to value Party over Country.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t agree with Lieberman&#8217;s stance on Iraq &#8212; I was opposed to the invasion even when Hillary Clinton and John Kerry were in favor of it.  But the fact remains that Lieberman&#8217;s record is more Liberal than Conservative.  And if the new Democratic motto is &#8220;Tow the party line, or get out&#8221;, they&#8217;re gonna lose a lot more Statesmen in favor of AINOs, and alienate a LOT more voters.</p>
<p>Is that really what you want?</p>
