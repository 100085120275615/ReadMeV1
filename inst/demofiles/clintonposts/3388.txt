<div>Lindsay's Unwanted Pen Pal  <br />
<br />Lindsay Lohan has reached another important milestone in her celebrity career--her very first (alleged) stalker.<br />The 20-year-old actress has reportedly been receiving some unwelcome attention from a man who has been sending her letters asking to meet her and signing them with his name and phone number.<br />The same man also reached out to Lohan by sending her flowers on the set of her upcoming movie, Georgia Rule, according to TMZ.com, which concerned security enough to post a memo on the gate reading: "One of our actresses has a stalker."<br />A source close to Lohan told the Website that her security guards are looking into the matter and trying to contact the man. (Which, considering he helpfully provided his contact info, shouldn't be too much of a challenge.) So far Team Lohan hasn't sought a restraining order against her admirer.<br />Lohan made reference to an unwanted admirer in the July issue of British GQ, though it was unclear whether it was the same individual who's been sending her letters of late.<br />"I have one really bad stalker," the actress said. "He says he's going to be at the Chateau Marmont before my birthday and prove to me that we're meant to be together, even if he has to take me away and teach me. They have a picture of him there. It's scary."<br />For Lohan, her unrequited pen pal is just another unpleasant event in what has already been a less than perfect summer for the starlet.<br />Within the last few weeks, she was treated at the hospital for dehydration, publicly taken to task over her alleged unprofessionalism by the producer of her upcoming movie, subpoenaed to testify on behalf of her mother and nearly crushed by paparazzi outside an L.A. eatery.<br />It's enough to make a girl want to get away--which is exactly what Lohan says she wants to do.<br />In an interview with the September issue of Elle magazine, the Mean Girls star said her sights are set on paying a visit to the troops in<br />Iraq.<br />"I've been trying to go to Iraq with<br />Hillary Clinton for so long," she said. "Hillary was trying to work it out, but it seemed too dangerous."<br />The New York senator's fears aside, Lohan still hopes to visit the war-torn country.<br />"I'm not afraid of going," she said. "My security guard is going to take me to a gun range when I get back to L.A., and I'm going to start taking shooting lessons." <br />Yahoo News</div>
