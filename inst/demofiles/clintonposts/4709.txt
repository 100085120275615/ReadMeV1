<p>Paul,<br />
 I hope you are doing well.  I have had an amazing week meeting some HUGE supporters of Folk Art: Hillary Brett (FAF) and Nann at Immaculate Baking Company.  I also stopped in to meet Ted Oliver at Oliver&#8217;s Southern Folk Art.  And I met with Betty Bercowski again - I love her. It has been a FABULOUS week. </p>
	<p> The TRAM Fair is coming along quite well.  We are still rounding up artists, though.  Have you had any luck on your end rounding up artists who would like to come out and participate?  I think I have one application from one of you guys&#8217; artists.  Please do a second round of recruitment, if you don&#8217;t mind. </p>
	<p> Hillary is working on getting some people, but we have run into some logistical issues about getting them to the fair since some of them do not drive.  We are working on working out transportation.  Ted gave me some names to contact today. I am excited.  Really excited.  This is going to be an awesome event. </p>
	<p> Let me know if you come up with more people.  And if you  have people coming from Alabama or North Carolina, maybe we can work out some carpools. </p>
