Wednesday marked the first anniversary of George Bush's historic presidential victory. He received more votes than any president in history. <br />The president is low in the polls but high in power, the opposite of his predecessor.<br /><br />I disagree with many of Bush's actions. What was he thinking when he expanded Medicare to cover drugs?<br /><br />But he is getting the job done. The Reagan Revolution continues.<br /><br />Bush appointed as chief justice John Roberts, who cut his legal teeth in the Reagan White House. <br /><br />Another Reagan White House lawyer, Sam Alito, soon will join him. According to Michael Barone of U.S. News & World Report, Democrats lack the votes to filibuster, which is the only way to stop this appointment.<br /><br />Cross another item off the honey-do list.<br /><br />Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid paid homage to Bush's power on Tuesday by throwing a hissy fit. <br /><br />He shut down the Senate for a couple of hours because he didn't get his way on investigating the Bush administration's use of intelligence before the Iraq war. Anything that slows Congress from passing more laws that deprive us of our liberties is OK by me. <br /><br />But Reid is just mad because the Plame investigation flamed out. <br /><br />After two years of investigation, Reid got nothing. Democratic dreams of Karl Rove being frog-marched and perp-walked out of the White House evaporated. They wanted a Harley, they got a Scooter Libby.<br /><br />Maybe, just maybe, this administration is a lot cleaner than its critics say it is.<br /><br />The charges against Libby are serious, and if guilty, he should serve a stretch in prison. Li'l Kim is spending a year in prison for perjury. She is some singer who is most notable for not wearing much clothing.<br /><br />Rove remains standing. In regicide, you must kill the king or fall upon one's sword. In their botched attempt at Rovicide, Democrats threw a tantrum.<br /><br />I am no fan of Bob Byrd, but he led Senate Democrats well. When he pushed the rules, bills became laws. <br /><br />Reid? He's Miss Prissy in the Foghorn Leghorn cartoons. Democrats need a real man for the job: Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />Her husband, Bill Clinton, was extremely popular.<br /><br />But his personal popularity did not translate into political power. He could not get a health care plan through a Democratic Congress.<br /><br />That led to a Republican Congress, which forced upon him welfare reform and a balanced budget. <br /><br />And when Newt Gingrich attempted Billicide and failed, away went Newt.<br /><br />Bush's father was very well liked, and dumped after one term.<br /><br />This Bush is the least popular president since Jimmy Carter. My mother simply cannot stand this Bush.<br /><br />But he continues to roll. The agenda that got him to the White House by the thinnest of margins -- 593 votes in Florida -- is being completed. <br /><br />Education reform, tax relief, the energy bill -- the list of accomplishments rivals Reagan's, even if some of it belongs with Lyndon Johnson.<br /><br />Unpopularity has its rewards. With half of the country automatically opposed, Bush must tend to the 62 million people who elected him. <br /><br />Last week, enough of them wanted him to dump Harriet Miers. He did.<br /><br />He wound up with Alito, a far better choice from what I have seen of his decisions.<br /><br />Power is transient. So is popularity. A couple of other presidents weren't very popular.<br /><br />But Abe Lincoln and Harry Truman did all right.<br /><br />So will this Bush.
