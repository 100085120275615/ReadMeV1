Maybe they will pull an <em>Office Space</em> and steal copy machines and beat them up in a field somewhere, or maybe they will pull a <em>Jerry Maguire</em> and make an awkward exit from the Capitol: "I'm not going to do what you all think I'm going to do, which is flip out. All I want to know is, who's coming with me"?  </p>

<p>After the Lamont victory over Lieberman in Connecticut this week, the talking heads and spinsters on the right have been telling us all how the primary was a sign that the Democrats are both divided on key issues and incapable of handling the situation in Iraq. "Our candidates have to draw and point out differences in how they would approach and win the war in Iraq and how their opponents would," said Senator John Thune (R-SD). "<a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/ap/2006/08/07/ap2932792.html">The biggest thing we have going for us on that issue is that Democrats are very divided.</a>" </p>

<p>The theme of "division" for the Democratic Party sounds like a pretty consistent talking point for their opposition, but it also seems a bit misguided and desperate.</p>

<p>When examining the prominent theories of electoral politics within the context of democracy, two stand out with particular relevance when discussing our current situation. On one side lays utilitarianism, which promotes the idea that our elected officials should represent us based on the public will. If the majority of one's constituents feel a particular way about an issue, then so should their representatives. The other ideology could be described as Burkean (named for political philosopher Edmund Burke). Those who subscribe to this ideology believe that our elected politicians should act according to their own beliefs. When it comes time for re-election, the people have the chance to either keep or fire them based on their actions in office.</p>

<p>In the case of Joe Lieberman, he clearly acted according to his own beliefs with regard to the war. He has stated that the American people must support President Bush and his decisions. Nevertheless, Lieberman could easily see that <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/iraq.htm">89% of his party and 62% overall would disagree with that position</a>. Voting Lieberman out has not exposed division - it exposed the danger of aligning yourself with the President on this issue.</p>

<p>If the Republicans are indeed more unified than Democrats, you have to wonder what sparked the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/10/nyregion/10debate.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">negative exchange between two Republicans running for Senate in New York</a>.</p>

<blockquote>"You brought up your wife, and I must tell you that that's not a personal issue," she said. "That's a professional issue. Because when you were mayor of Yonkers, you had an affair with your secretary while you were married to somebody else. You tripled her salary and made her your chief of staff. You were living with her. You doubled your own personal income. You got financial gain from that. And you had two children." At one point, Ms. McFarland turned to Mr. Spencer and said, "You taxed and spent like Hillary, and you've behaved like Bill."</blockquote>
