<p>If Hillary&#8217;s campaign includes 1) Ending Deficit Spending, 2) Ending our involvement within the borders of the Iraqi Civil War, but remaining in neighboring nations to contain the Civil War from overspilling the borders and involving other nations, and 3) calling for election, campaign, and tax reform, she WILL BE A CENTRIST and she will very likely win not only the nomination, but the Presidency as well. </p>
<p>Can she pull that shift in her campaign platform off? Well, that is the question, isn&#8217;t it? McCain could not run on that kind of centrist platform. Therefore, Hillary has far more potential than McCain of ever winning in 2008. </p>
