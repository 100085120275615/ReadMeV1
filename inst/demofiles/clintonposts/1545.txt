<div align="justify">President George W Bush and his wife Laura yesterday attended the Daytona 500, the season's biggest stock car race, trying to woo a newly identified swing bloc any candidate must win over. Alec Russell in Daytona Beach reports on the mood of the Nascar Dads<br /><br />'One guy moved all the way over here from California to prove he was one of us. He's a good driver... but he's still an Armani suit in a world of blue jeans."<br /><br />Richard Waters slapped his thighs and laughed. In his black and red Chevrolet racing driver's jacket and grey woolly hat, no one was going to mistake this stock car fan for an "Armani suit".<br /><br />"Rather like Bush," I ventured, thinking of the president's skilful reinvention of himself as a cowboy-booted Texan man of the people, rather than a patrician of New England stock.<br /><br />"Naah," replied Waters, with a look of amused disdain. "He's the reeeal thing."<br /><br />"One of the best presidents we had," put in his wife, Candace. She, too, was in stock-car rig: an orange and white driver's jacket festooned with the name of her favourite Nascar (National Association for stock car Auto racing) driver.<br /><br />"He wasn't handed his career on a silver platter. And just compare him to past presidents, like Clinton... Thaat's embarrassing."<br /><br />Candace, 29, a school secretary and a mother of three, pulled a face. Her reaction suggested that Senator John Kerry, the frontrunner for the Democratic presidential nomination, will have to throw off the latest allegations swirling about his private life if he is to win her vote.<br /><br /><br />Daytona pit crew worker Richard Shafer goes flying as number 27 makes a pitstop<br /><br />Why does she like Bush? "It's his backbone. Take Eyerak. I know about the WMD. But, to me, they don't have as much bearing as terrorist attacks. It's easy to be an armchair quarterback - I can call any game on a Monday afternoon. But who else would have stood up for America?"<br /><br />From down the road came the deep, throaty roars of high-powered engines. That was enough politics - far more important matters were at hand. The stock-car season was revving up once more, and a race was about to begin. We pulled down our hats and headed for the stadium.<br /><br />"If I had a choice of coming to this race or the Superbowl?" mused Richard. "No choice. This race. They go at 200 mph. One of them can get killed in an instant. They deserve all they get paid."<br /><br />The Pitstop Cafe, Daytona Beach, is not everyone's idea of a jolly venue for a Sunday afternoon out. Watery coffee, popcorn and hot dogs are the staple fare. And stock car racing is the religion.<br /><br />All are welcome, of course, but to fit in, you have to embrace the uniform - leather jackets or imitation driver's rig, baseball hats, logos - as millions of Americans do each weekend during the nine-month season.<br /><br />Welcome to the weekend world of blue-collar America.<br /><br />Nascar does not play to our caricatures of the United States: its 70 million mainly male fans are not rednecks; they are not rich; and they are definitely not wacky.<br /><br />Rather they are country music-loving, Washington-sceptic, God-fearing (but not evangelical), corporation-abhorring, backroom boys of the American Dream.<br /><br />But you can expect to hear a lot about them in the coming months. Somewhat to their surprise, Nascar Dads have been identified as the key swing voters in the presidential election.<br /><br />The era of the Soccer Moms, the side-line-cheering, apple-pie-baking, people-carrier-driving suburbanites who supposedly ushered Mr Clinton to his second term, is over - if it ever really existed.<br /><br />Essentially, Nascar Dads are white, southern males. They traditionally voted Democrat but turned Republican under Ronald Reagan and have hardly looked back since.<br /><br />Six hundred miles to the north, and in a different cultural universe, Karlyn Bowman, a senior analyst at Washington's leading think-tank - the American Enterprise Institute - laughed wryly. She senses a whiff of media marketing in the latest cult phrase.<br /><br />"Every election needs a hot new group," she said, ticking off a list of "extinct" ones: the Angry White Males, who drove the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994; the Soccer Moms; the Security Moms, an ephemeral coinage of the post-September 11 period.<br /><br />But in America, politicians dismiss polls at their peril. This is too large and diverse a nation for anyone to get a true feel of the mood merely by going out on the stump.<br /><br />Pollsters are the prophets of the campaign. And they have decreed that if the Democrats can woo back some of their blue-collar male supporters, they just may get their revenge on Mr Bush. On paper at least, Mr Kerry - the Vietnam war hero - is just the sort of "tough" Democrat Nascar Dads could respect.<br /><br />So that is why I found myself at the giant Daytona Beach stadium last week, trying to hear myself speak above the ear-popping, stomach-churning roar of stock car engines. And that is why George W Bush was there yesterday for the biggest race of the season: the Daytona 500.<br /><br />The pollsters estimate that Mr Bush won over 60 per cent of Nascar supporters at the last election. But that figure could fall, and in Florida last time, there were only a few hundred votes in it.<br /><br />Sitting near the top of the main stand were two classic country girls: Dawn DeMatos and Charlene Henkel, both in sweatshirts and caps.<br /><br />The day's schedule had gone badly awry. One of the cars had hit another amidships at 180 mph and burst into flames. The giant central screen beamed helpful replays for any who missed it.<br /><br />Then there was worse news: a race-track employee had been hit by a car while clearing up the debris. He was killed on the spot. Rumours of his death sent a shudder through the crowd, but most - including Dawn and Charlene - stayed in the hope of seeing more racing.<br /><br />"They say baseball is the all-American sport - but Nascar is a lot more patriotic," said Dawn, a 38-year-old hairdresser who moved to Daytona from Massachusetts to get closer to the home of Nascar. "Every Sunday, we watch it. It's the smell of the fuel on the first lap."<br /><br />"They constantly do God Bless America. It's very patriotic," said her friend, Charlene. "Eat, drink and live Nascar," she giggled, pointing to her stomach, mouth and head.<br /><br />For Mr Bush's advisers, who appreciate all too well the potency of wrapping him in the Stars and Stripes, the talk of patriotism is good news. When he played host to last season's Nascar winners on the White House lawn in November, he adroitly linked them to a defining issue of the election: national security.<br /><br />Brandishing a leather jacket festooned with Nascar stickers, he eulogised the sport before thanking the drivers for their support for the armed forces. "You're reminding us all about the importance of serving a greater cause than ourself."<br /><br />But he would do well to recall the muted reception his father had at a rally a decade or so ago. Nascar supporters, conservative by nature, are also fiercely independent and have a healthy suspicion of politicians.<br /><br />George W Bush had an easier ride yesterday than Mr Clinton, who was booed when he turned up on the campaign trail in 1992. But there were mutterings beforehand that his security entourage would snarl up the entrance and it would have been better if he had stayed away: for Nascar fans, politics is a distant second after racing.<br /><br />Dawn wrinkled her nose. "I wish he'd leave my sport alone. He's hoping the people here think he's an all-round kind of guy. But it won't impress them. He's more like 'tea with the Queen' than a Nascar racer. Now if they said 'Burt Reynolds', I'd say yeah! He's more our kind of guy."<br /><br />Two hours after the accident the engines rasped into life and once again, five abreast, Sling Shot, Diablo, Thunder Puppy and the rest thundered round the track. It must have been quite similar watching chariots races in the Colosseum - though a lot less noisy.<br /><br />Behind me sat four taciturn Nascar Dads. Steve Blackburn, their unofficial spokesman, was, like many diehard fans, wearing headphones to listen to the drivers' radio. "Cut in two," he muttered, referring to the dead worker. "Sheared off his legs."<br /><br />Blackburn and his friends had driven down from Kentucky for the weekend. They will follow as many races as they can over the next nine and a half months. They will also stick with Bush.<br /><br />"I'd still vote for him even if he didn't back Nascar," said Blackburn. "He freed a lot of people in Iraq from what they were under. It's just a shame we didn't finish it off 10 years ago."<br /><br />An accurate reflection of Nascar Dad? Probably. But there are still nine months to go. Traditionally, the mass of American voters make up their minds in the summer.<br /><br />Near the top of the stands, Jack Snyder, a burly technician, peered through his binoculars. His wife was at his side, draped in a huge Nascar blanket. He backed Bush last time. Will he again?<br /><br />"I want a president to build up the economy and end the war on terrorism. I'm in-between right now," he said. And that is why this election is not in the bag - unless the Democrat campaign falls apart. </div><div align="justify"> </div><div align="justify"><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/02/16/wus16.xml&sSheet=/portal/2004/02/16/ixportal.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/02/16/wus16.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/02/16/ixportal.html</a><br /></div>
