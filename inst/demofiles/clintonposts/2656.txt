<div><p><span>Joe Lieberman, the Democratic nominee for Vice President in 2000, and who nearly won, has lost the Democratic Primary for his Senate Seat in Connecticut.&nbsp; A tremendous amount of funding and campaign effort was donated to his far-left opponent, Ned Lamont.&nbsp; Lieberman will now run as an Independent in the November general election, and probably win.&nbsp; The net result will simply be the loss of a seat for the Democrats and the addition of one more Independent seat.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>More importantly, this has moved the center of gravity of the Democratic party leftward.&nbsp; Essentially, any Democrat that supports the Iraq War and Israel in its war against Hizbollah is unwelcome by the left wing that now dominates the party.&nbsp; This, despite the fact that the most powerful Democrats of them all, the Clintons, supported Lieberman in his primary campaign.&nbsp; Make no mistake, the events of today make Hillary Clinton's Presidential bid vastly more difficult, as the far left will seek to discredit her as well.</span></p>

<p><span>Think about which politicians are considered to be near the middle of the ideological spectrum in America today.&nbsp; Names that come to mind are John McCain, Rudy Giuliani, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Joe Lieberman.&nbsp; Of these, three are comfortably in the Republican Party, and two are serious Presidential candidates.&nbsp; By contrast, the only one who was a Democrat has been pushed out.&nbsp; Which party has the bigger tent that covers the middle?&nbsp; Remember, the party that controls the middle is the one that wins elections.&nbsp; No matter how vocal the extremists are, they cannot gain a majority of the vote.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.brendanloy.com/2006/08/time-for-a-divorce.html">An eloquent essay from the Irish Trojan narrates the decision of a moderate to finally part company with what the Democratic Party has become.</a>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>One last thought comes to mind, however.&nbsp; For 6 years, extreme Bush-haters have failed to come to terms with the results of the 2000 election, insisting it was 'stolen' and that Joe Lieberman was the rightful Vice President.&nbsp; Now that the same extremists no longer like Joe Lieberman, does this mean they are no longer angry about Florida 2000?&nbsp; You can ask : <em>&quot;You are<span> still upset that he did not become the VP six years ago, but you don't even want him as a Senator?&quot;</span></em></span></p>

<p><span>Be sure to ask this to the next extreme leftist you meet, it should be funny.&nbsp; </span></p></div>
