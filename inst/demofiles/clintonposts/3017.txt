<div>Egads - Hillary has been talking tough on the illegal immigration issue for quite a few months now - though <span>notably</span> silent on the Minutemen.  [She can't bring herself to stretch quite <span>that</span> far.] Her <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20041213-124920-6151r.htm">supporters</a> expect her to win the issue hands down if [IF!] she runs in '08.<br />

<blockquote>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is staking out a position on illegal immigration that is more conservative than President Bush, a strategy that supporters and detractors alike see as a way for the New York Democrat to shake the "liberal" label and appeal to traditionally Republican states. </blockquote>
<br />
<br />Here's some tough-talk from Hillary on the issue:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Mrs. Clinton said she does not "think that we have protected our borders or our ports or provided our first responders with the resources they need, <span>so we can do more and we can do better</span>." </blockquote>
<br />
<br />OK, granted - that's hardly a heart-pounding inspirational speech there.  [TANGENT: But it does bring back hilarious memories of Kerry droning <span>on</span> and <span>on</span> about how he could conduct the war in Iraq by "doing more, doing it faster, doing it better, and with much less money" than Bush.  Um...that's the extent of your plan: same as Bush but only BETTER?!  Yep, real mastermind original, Kerry, and not quite the ground-breaking Plan For the War on Terror that you'd hoped it would be.  Word of advice:  next time give us the details of HOW.  What - you didn't get that far?  Didn't think so. END TANGENT]  But she <span>is</span> saying the right things, at the right time, in the right place [FOX news, no less].  She's no dummy. <br />
<br />Hillary is staking out her immigration real-estate early.  Fortunately for her future competitor, the Clintons weren't so great on immigration during their presidencies, so there's a pretty lousy track record to point to.  And it remains to be seen if she can actually <span>walk the talk</span>.  When was the last time you saw a Democrat do <span>that</span>?! It's tough (nigh impossible) for Democrats to stand tough on anything unless it's anti-Bush, but Hillary's got three more years to put up or shut up on this issue.  If she <span>earnestly</span> [yeah, I know] pledges to do something and actually follows through then her position on this issue will be securely to the...RIGHT. <span>[gasp!]</span>
<br />
<br />So, what happens to the disillusioned Bush-backers who have long held illegal immigration in their Top 3 national issues?  Well, Hillary's camp is going to swing wiiiiiide the gates. Don't think some won't consider crossing over - that's exactly what Hillary's camp is counting on.<br />
<br />Luckily for the Red states, Bushicano can't run again, so there's open opportunity for a tough<span>er</span>-talking gunslinger to come to town. Whoever that is had better start strengthening their platform now, if they haven't already - because in the absence of another terrorist attack on our soil, illegal immigration will be THE defining voter issue of 2008.  <br />
<br />We better start hearing some top shelf solutions coming from any potential Red candidates - or we'll start to see some kind of <span>unholy alliance</span> between Hillary and some very pissed-off Republicans et al. <span> Brrrrrrr....gives me the creeps just thinking about it!</span>
