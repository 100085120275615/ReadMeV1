<div>Being a Canadian that's freshly displaced into the United States, I thought that I would be in a particularly good position to comment upon the differences between the two countries that share the longest undefended (at least for now) border.  While, I've actually been quite surprised by how similar Americans and Canadians are (other than peculiarities of speech it seems to me that Canadians and Americans really aren't that different), I've noticed that are some marked differences between various public institutions.  One example is the media and it's coverage of politics, or lack thereof.<br />
<br />In the Canadian media one's almost inundated with coverage of the minutiae of the the Canadian political milieu.  You often see articles or bits about the various debates that break out during question period and quite often you learn about various bills that are to be considered in various legislative bodies.  Indeed, though Parliament is in recess in the Globe and Mail today you can read about the Liberals strategy for the next parliamentary session, an Alberta same-sex bill, and Ontario's ahead of schedule elimination of its deficit.<br /> <br />However, such is not the case down here.  I've been here for a month and I have no idea what either the congress or the Ohio legislature is up to.  And that's not for lack of trying to find out.  Indeed, I regularly read the US Today, The New York Times, and the Cincinnati Enquirer.  Yet, other than a handful of profiles on various politicos or the occasional passing of a controversial law somewhere I haven't seen any substantial coverage of what's going on in government.  For example, in today's New York Times the only article regarding substantial political news is a piece regarding what issues will face the Democrats if they manage to retake Congress in November.  All the other pieces in the politics section have to do with Hillary Clinton trying to find funding for Ned Lamont, Barack Obama getting a warm welcome in Kenya, or similar fluffy articles.<br />
<br />Moreover, if one just looks at the breakdown of the various stories that can be found in various news sources one can see a marked difference in the amount of coverage regarding politics.  In the Canadian media, it does seem to me that political issues take up the most column inches.  On the other hand, it seems that down here the topics that garner the most attention are sports, crime, and bad car accidents.  <br />
<br />It strikes me that this lack in the media might explain a great many things, such as the apathy that so many Americans seem to have for the political process and the apparent ability of US governments to get away with things that would get a Canadian government thrown out of power.<br />
<br />Indeed, it seems to me that the traditional media coverage of politics down here is so weak that comedians like Jon Stewart or various political blogs are the sources you have to turn to if you want to have any idea about what's going on.  Which really is a sad state of affairs in my opinion.</div>
