<div>The movie that is.<br />
<br />Okay.  I admit I have watched this movie, like, 6 times already and it is friggin awesome.  The first time I watched it, frankly, I didn't get it.  By the third time, I was addicted.  If you don't know about it, you should.  It's become a cultural icon.<br />My eleven year old daughter speaks in teenage incredible nerd language all day and it still makes me laugh.  A lot.  And I am 42.  I crave steak and will probably throw one like a football, over those mountains, this summer.<br />
<br />I can't even say the word "bad" now without a Napoleon inflection ("My lips hurt real <em>bad</em>.)  I bought Lip Schitz Lip Balm and I will Vote For Pedro (Not Hillary).<br />
<br />Any Llama I ever get will, I repeat, will be called Tina You Fat Lard.<br />
<br />Gotta love it.<br />
<br />What am I going to do now?<br />
<br />Whatever I feel like I want to do.  Gosh!<br />Peace out,<br />Alana Marie Burke</div>
