<blockquote><p>Â A priceless ancient Peruvian headdress, looted nearly 20 years ago, has been recovered by detectives from the Metropolitan police&#8217;s art and antiques squad.</p>
<p>Officers refused to reveal how they located the headdress, which depicts the image of a sea god. They would only say a London solicitor&#8217;s firm had facilitated the return on behalf of their client after an intelligence-led investigation. The headdress is made from an embossed sheet of gold and considered to be an example of Peruvian Mochica civilisation art dating back to AD700. [snip]</p></blockquote>

<p>Often items from antiquity make me think of Time Travel.Â  They have surely managed it&#8230; survival first, then discovery - and for some,Â as withÂ this remarkable headress, spirited away, a time &#8216;&#8217;lost'&#8217; from the world it originally inhabited, then &#8220;found&#8221; - onceÂ again.</p>
<p>That time travel aspect is especially poignant when a face, in this case a sea god-dess&#8230; <img src="http://marisacat.wordpress.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" /> Â peers out at the passing time.</p>

<blockquote><p><em><strong>&#8216;&#8217;The Power of Nightmares: The Rise of the Politics of Fear'&#8217;</strong></em>.</p>
<p>One of the significant contributions to the &#8220;war on terror&#8221; by Britain&#8217;s home secretary David Blunkett before his abrupt departure from the Tony Blair cabinet last year was his statement on terrorism in the House of Commons that specifically flagged the possibility of a &#8220;dirty bomb&#8221; being planted in Britain by terrorists. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Curtis&#8217;s argument [in a brilliant television series on BBC2] was that much of the threat of international terrorism turns out to be in actuality &#8220;a fantasy that has been exaggerated and distorted by politicians &#8230; <strong>In an age when all the grand ideas have lost credibility, fear of a phantom enemy is all the politicians have left to maintain their power.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Curtis placed al-Qaeda terrorism in a long line of dramatic panics in Britain&#8217;s checkered history since the Elizabethan era, which included the arrival of Spanish raiding parties, French revolutionary agitators, anarchists, Bolsheviks, and Irish republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Â  <img vspace="3" width="300" src="http://www.smh.com.au/ffximage/2005/12/05/nightmares_051205021755958_wideweb__300x269.jpg" hspace="3" height="269" /></p>
<blockquote><p>Naturally, Curtis comes readily to mind a week after British authorities arrested some two dozen Muslims on August 10 for plotting to blow up trans-Atlantic flights from United Kingdom to the United States. Not a shred of evidence has since seen the light of day in this Mother of all Dastardly Plots. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8230; the exclusive, charmed circle that comprises the US Central Intelligence Agency, Britain&#8217;s MI6 and Pakistan&#8217;s Inter-Services Intelligence.</p>
<p>The so-called Islamic terror network is the trinity&#8217;s fabrication. It has become what would be known in intelligence parlance as an &#8220;asset&#8221; or an &#8220;instrument&#8221;. The &#8220;intelligence assets&#8221; do enjoy a certain measure of independence and autonomy vis-a-vis their sponsors but that is part of the art of dissimulation. Al-Qaeda has incrementally become then a situation or a chain of events in politics that can arouse a particular emotional reaction instantaneously.</p></blockquote>

In a quarterly report to Congress on weapons costs earlier this month, the Pentagon reported that of the $1.61 trillion it thinks it will need for big-ticket weapons, it has spent more than half so far &#8212; about $909 billion.</p></blockquote>
