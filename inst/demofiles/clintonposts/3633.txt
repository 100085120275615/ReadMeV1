<div>The question really isn't who will run against pretty-boy Harry Ford Jr. for the open seat from Tennessee. The question is can enough voters turn out to keep the "Ford Political Machine" from rigging the election.<br />
<br />Bryant, VanHillary and yes I'd even vote for Bob Corker before I'd see a Ford in office. Personally I voted for Bryant as did most people I know.<br />
<br />Too bad I'm too busy to spend more time focusing some attention on this. Hopefully I'll be able to shed some more light on my personal anybody but Ford campaign in the near future.<br />
<br />ANYBODY BUT HAROLD FORD JR IN 06!</div>
