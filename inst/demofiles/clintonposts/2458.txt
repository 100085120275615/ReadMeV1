<br />Nope, I really don't see a pattern here to justify profiling, do you?<br />
<br />So, to ensure we Americans never offend anyone, particularly fanatics intent on killing us, airport security screeners will no longer be allowed to profile certain people. They must conduct random searches of 80-year-old women, little kids, airline pilots with proper identification, secret agents of the President's security detail, 85-year old Congressmen with metal hips, and Medal of Honor winning and former Governor Joe Foss, but leave Muslim Males between the ages 17 and 40 alone because of profiling.<br />
<br />Let's send this to as many people as we can so that the Gloria Aldreds and other dunder-headed attorneys along with Federal Justices that want to thwart common sense, feel doubly ashamed of themselves - if they have any such sense.<br />
<br />As the writer of the award winning story "Forrest Gump" so aptly put it, "Stupid is as stupid does."<br />
<br />Come on people wake up!!!<br />
<br />Our Country and our troops need our support and prayers....</div>
