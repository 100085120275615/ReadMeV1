<p>A great editorial today in <a title="OpinionJournal - Featured Article" href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110008785" target="_blank">The Wall Street Journal</a>:<blockquote>"This wasn't supposed to happen today," a U.S. official told the Washington Post of the arrests and terror alert. "It was supposed to happen several days from now. We hear the British lost track of one or two guys. They had to move." Meanwhile, British antiterrorism chief Peter Clarke said at a news conference that the plot was foiled because "a large number of people" had been under surveillance, with police monitoring "spending, travel and communications."</p>

<p>Let's emphasize that again: The plot was foiled because a large number of people were under surveillance concerning their <em>spending, travel and communications.</em> Which leads us to wonder if Scotland Yard would have succeeded if the ACLU or the New York Times had first learned the details of such surveillance programs.</p>

<p>And almost on political cue yesterday, Members of the Congressional Democratic leadership were using the occasion to suggest that the U.S. is actually more vulnerable today despite this antiterror success. Harry Reid, who's bidding to run the Senate as Majority Leader, saw it as one more opportunity to insist that "the Iraq war has diverted our focus and more than $300 billion in resources from the war on terrorism and has created a rallying cry for international terrorists."</p>

<p>Ted Kennedy chimed in that "it is clear that our misguided policies are making America more hated in the world and making the war on terrorism harder to win." Mr. Kennedy somehow overlooked that the foiled plan was nearly identical to the "Bojinka" plot led by Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to blow up airliners over the Pacific Ocean in 1995. Did the Clinton Administration's "misguided policies" invite that plot? And if the Iraq war is a diversion and provocation, just what policies would Senators Reid and Kennedy have us "focus" on?</blockquote>More:<blockquote>The real lesson of yesterday's antiterror success in Britain is that the threat remains potent, and that the U.S. government needs to be using every legal tool to defeat it. At home, that includes intelligence and surveillance and data-mining, and abroad it means all of those as well as an aggressive military plan to disrupt and kill terrorists where they live so they are constantly on defense rather than plotting to blow up U.S.-bound airliners.</p>

<p>As the time since 9/11 has passed, many of America's elites have begun to portray U.S. government policies as a greater threat than the terrorists themselves. George Soros and others have said this explicitly, and their political allies in Congress and the media have staged a relentless campaign against the very practices that saved innocent lives this week. We doubt that many Americans who will soon board an airplane agree.</blockquote>The truly sad part of all of this is that once again, the curtain has been pulled back to reveal that an entire class of citizens are cynical enough to believe that this whole incident is nothing more than a plot to divert attention away from REAL NEWS (aka Ned Lamont), and a class of politicians who are only too happy to exploit the paranoia of those individuals for political gain at the expense of national security (aka Ted Kennedy, Harry Reid, and most of the national Democrats).</p>

<p>What will happen if these people manage to take control of Congress, or even one house of congress?  If the Republicans lose in November, I believe it will be because of their inability to govern with self-restraint on domestic issues, and because of the arrogance and corruption that has seeped into the Republican leadership.</p>

<p>And so the lack of self-restraint and humility among the Republican leadership and caucus has now become more than just an annoyance to the Republican base - it's now a national security issue.  Great job there, guys!</p>
