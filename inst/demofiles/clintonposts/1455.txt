<blockquote><p>As a politechnical aside, Lieberman's defeat means that one of the Senate's most strident morality crusaders may be forced to retire. Lieberman has campaigned against <a href="http://news.com.com/Senate+panel+OKs+video+game+study/2100-1047_3-6047750.html?tag=nl" title="Senate panel OKs video game study -- Wednesday, Mar 8, 2006">violent video games</a>, embraced a <a href="http://news.com.com/Senators+seek+Web+porn+tax/2100-1030_3-5814309.html?tag=nl" title="Senators seek Web porn tax -- Monday, Aug 1, 2005">Web porn tax</a>, and called for a <a href="http://news.com.com/Bush+administration+objects+to+.xxx+domains/2100-1028_3-5833764.html?tag=nl" title="Bush administration objects to .xxx domains -- Monday, Aug 15, 2005">.xxx domain</a>. (He's also been supported by <a href="http://news.com.com/Tech+leaders+stump+for+Lieberman/2100-1028_3-1010978.html?tag=nl" title="Tech leaders stump for Lieberman -- Wednesday, May 28, 2003">Silicon Valley leaders</a>, probably more for his free-trading views than anything else.)</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Fink says:</strong> Lieberman is whining that his website was <a href="http://www.postchronicle.com/news/original/article_21233007.shtml" target="_blank">hacked</a>, &quot;<a href="http://dailykos.com" target="_blank">bloggers</a>&quot; (bad ones he says) conspired against him and just plain ol' WAAAA WAAAA WAAAA. Joe&#8230; you lost because you're fucking putz, a turncoat who fanned that flames of the Clinton witchhunt, supported a dumb war with the zeal of a 15 year old with a crush on his teacher and did we mention your sourpuss cost Al Gore the presidency?&nbsp; Oh and Joe if you weren't such a Gloomy Gus, Gore would have been elected and we wouldn't be in the mess we are today with Bush.&nbsp; Bite me Joe and stop fucking whining.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We, of course, don't completely discount <a href="http://dailykos.com" target="_blank">Kos</a>' role in leading the charge against Lieberman, we just don't think he's as <em>tayvlonish </em>as Joe wants us to believe he is.&nbsp;</p>
