</a>A true battle to the death, this was not, but rest assured some money was made on this trip. If I was a betting man, I would've place my money on Hillary. The obvious reason is that she's been chuggin' since she married "Awesome Bill" and I bet she's put a lot of bottles away over the years. As for McCain, he would've made it close. I figure the age difference would play a big part, but if this was Russian Roulette, then it's McCain hands down. I saw "The Deer Hunter", and if McCain went through that, then he would be the ultimate b.a. in that battle. Vodka on the other hand is a little different story, plus one quick flash of her assets and a drunken McCain is down for the count. I just hope that when they debate, that it's this interesting.</div>
