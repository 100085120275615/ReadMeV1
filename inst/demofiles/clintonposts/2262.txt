<strong>
<span>Holy Hillary: I Always Prayed </span>
</strong>
</p> 
<br />Borrowing a page from President Bush, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton told a Boston audience this week that prayer has always played a meaningful role in her life - though accounts from her days as a student radical suggest that's probably not true.
<br />
<br />"I've always been a praying person," Clinton told a crowd of more than 500, including many religious leaders, at Boston's Fairmont Copley Plaza.
<br />
<br />According to the Boston Globe, the newly religious former first lady "invoked God more than half a dozen times" as she urged society to accommodate religious people who "live out their faith in the public square."
<br />
<br />Though she was raised as a Methodist, Clinton's open embrace of God, along with her insistence that she's "always been a praying person," has to come as a shock to those who remember her college days.
<br />
<br />Back then, Clinton was far more likely to be seen reading, not the Bible, but the writings of Marx and Mao - and had close associations with unabashed Communists for whom the mere mention of religion was heresy.
<br />
<br />One was Robert Treuhaft, who, as noted in the late Barbara Olson's Hillary biography "Hell to Pay," had "dedicated his entire legal career to advancing the agenda of the Soviet Communist Party."
<br />
<br />In 1972 Treuhaft offered the future Senator a summer internship at California's Berkeley University. Clinton accepted, immersing herself in Truehaft's brand of radical Stalinism. When she returned she was, according to Olson, "a budding Leninist."
<br />
<br />If Sen. Clinton was "a praying person" back then, she must have kept it well concealed from her radical mentors.
