<a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/05/corporate_porkbusting.html">Robert Novak</a>, on Corporate Porkbusting:<br /><i><blockquote>An earmark in the bill's Senate version would give $500 million to Northrop Grumman to reimburse cost overruns on U.S. Navy shipbuilding contracts caused by Katrina damage at the Mississippi Gulf Coast shipyards in Pascagoula and Gulfport. If the bill had been completed last week, money for the highly profitable defense contractor would not have been there -- an incentive for Northrop Grumman to lobby all the harder this week. <br /><br />Half a billion dollars is chump change at the Pentagon. But it is a symbol that the intensifying battle against individual lawmakers' earmarks in spending bills is turning to corporate welfare. That category of pork until now has been inviolate, protected by a bipartisan conspiracy of silence. <br /><br />The Northrop Grumman earmark was inserted by the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman himself, Thad Cochran of Mississippi. That once would have guaranteed passage without public notice, even though the Defense Department and the Navy oppose the spending as wasteful. <br /><br />But pork-busting freshman Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma now scrutinizes money bills, and he caught the Northrop Grumman earmark. The company, whose revenue last year totaled $40.7 billion, has received $500 million from its insurer and is in litigation seeking another $500 million. The Defense Contract Management Agency has declared "it would be inappropriate to allow Northrop Grumman to bill for costs potentially recoverable by insurance because payment by the government may otherwise relieve the carrier from their policy obligation." Factory Mutual Insurance Co., with 2004 revenue of $2.7 billion, then would be receiving indirect corporate welfare. <br /><br />Coburn told the Senate on May 2 that the Northrop Grumman payment "sets a terrible precedent for the future." He called it "a step too far. I believe we need to back up and let the private sector take care of its obligations." He mentioned unspecified federal "largesse" for the company, pointing to the questionable DDX destroyer. <br /><br />Efforts such as Coburn's over the years have been slapped down hard, but not this time. <b>The Coburn amendment barely lost, 51 to 48, in a rare Senate vote crossing party lines. Republicans split 28 to 27 against Mississippi's powerful senators, with John McCain and Majority Leader Bill Frist supporting Coburn. Democrats voted 24 to 20 for Northrop Grumman.</b> North Dakota's twin deficit hawks, Kent Conrad and Byron Dorgan, voted with Coburn, but <b>Edward M. Kennedy, Hillary Clinton and Democratic Leader Harry Reid supported corporate welfare</b>. <br /><br />That outrageous threat responded to a climate change in Washington. President Bush has declared he will veto the emergency money bill unless the $109 billion Senate measure is reduced by $14 billion. In making that cut, does Congress really want to keep half a billion dollars for Northrop Grumman at the cost of funds needed by U.S. troops and Katrina relief? If Congress can resist Northrop Grumman's blandishments and threats, it may soon take a small step toward confronting the massive problem of corporate welfare.</i></blockquote><br /><br />Novak highlights an interesting fact that has not been lost on many who - like myself - are following the pork issue closely: it's largely a bipartisan issue.  And largely, the freshmen are doing the best work.  The old guard or the appropriations establishment has become too accustomed to the old way, Trent Lott being the most egregious example.  <a href="http://porkbusters.org/2006/05/post_1.php#002341">Here</a> is a copy of Porkbusters' report card for the Senate.  27 receive high marks - 17 Republicans and 10 Democrats.  Since we always mention the people doing poorly (*cough, Trent Lott, cough*), let's see the list of Senators doing well:<br /><br /><b>Bayh (D-IN)</b><br />Bingaman (D-NM)<br />Bunning (R-KY)<br />Burr (R-NC)<br />Carper (D-DE)<br />Chafee (R-RI)<br /><b>Coburn (R-OK)</b><br />Conrad (D-ND)<br />DeMint (R-SC)<br />Ensign (R-NV)<br />Enzi (R-WY)<br /><b>Feingold (D-WI)</b><br /><b>Graham (R-SC)<br />Hagel (R-NE)</b><br />Inhofe (R-OK)<br />Kohl (D-WI)<br />Kyl (R-AZ)<br /><b>Lieberman (D-CT)</b><br />Lugar (R-IN)<br /><b>McCain (R-AZ)</b><br />Nelson (D-NE)<br /><b>Obama (D-IL)</b><br /><b>Stabenow (D-MI)</b><br />Sununu (R-NH)<br />Thomas (R-WY)<br />Thune (R-SD)<br />Voinovich (R-OH)  <br /><br />I've highlighted some notables - presidential hopefuls Evan Bayh, Chuck Hagel and John McCain, for instance, as well as Tom Coburn, who's largely leading the charge and has adopted pork as his personal pet issue.  It's also good to see some old guard Senators - like Lieberman and Graham, among others, who are seeing the importance of this issue.  <br /><br />Thankfully, this has largely become a bipartisan issue.  It's also become an issue, thankfully, that it is not smart to publicly speak out against.  It's hard to spin one's support of personal pet projects on the public dome with no national good as being something our government should routinely support.  And we wonder why we have such atrocious deficits.  <br /><br />Note: And while Debbie Stabenow's record on this issue is golden, it does not change my position on endorsing <a href="http://www.jerryzandstra.com/">Jerry Zandstra</a> to take her place in the Senate.
