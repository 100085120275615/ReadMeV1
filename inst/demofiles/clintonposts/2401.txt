<span>New York Post readers <a href="http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/letters/37401.htm">are not taking kindly</a> to recent revelations concerning the timeline between Bill Clinton's last minute pardon of Oil Financier Marc Rich and his ex-wife's contributions to the "Hillary for Senate campaign...

<em>"Bill Clinton pardons Marc Rich in the final minutes of his presidency, after Rich's ex-wife had donated to Hillary Clinton's senatorial campaign. And, of course, Rich immediately goes into business with Saddam Hussein in the Oil-for-Food scam. Now Hillary is running for president and Bill is looking to become the next U.N. secretary general.Quite the cozy arrangement, that."

<em>"When Bill Clinton pardoned Marc Rich in 2001, that made it easier for Rich to participate in the Oil-for-Food scandal. Therefore, it can be fairly said that Bill Clinton himself bears partial responsibility for the deaths of more than 1,000 soldiers in Iraq, since the reason the soldiers were sent in Iraq was to prevent Saddam from using his stolen booty to build WMDs.  Bill Clinton: the gift that keeps on giving."

<span>Hopefully, some chickens are coming home to roost for Bill and Hill now that Marc Rich has been fingered as an active participant in the U.N. Oil-for-Food fiasco. This is the same tax evader and fugitive whose ex-wife Denise funded Hillary's senate campaign and Bill's presidential library with big bucks, in exchange for a last minute presidential pardon for her husband just before Clinton left office. When Hillary Clinton runs for president as the Democratic candidate in 2008, the Republicans must not let Americans forget about Marc Rich.
