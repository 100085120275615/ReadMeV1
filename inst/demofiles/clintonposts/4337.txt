<p><span><span><strong><span>today's topline media2 trends:</span></strong> <strong>There's some dissapointment with </strong></span></span><a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/film/index.jsp"><span><strong>Snakes On A Plane </strong></span></a><span><strong>having only driven $15.2 million in its opening weekend? No way. I saw the movie and even though it's not a blockbuster, it's entirely entertaining, kitchy and most importantly - memorable. It's a movie surely driven by marketing maniacs with a great sense of nomenclature and use of the Internet as a direct response media vehicle. And it has all the makings of a long-term cult hit- a movie teens and adults alike will want to rent and pop in the DVD player at every imaginable time the party is starting to die down. While the pre-movie release momentum is over, the post movie marketing momentum is yet to be seen. </strong></span></p><p><span><strong>Where will word-of-mouth take this three star B movie? In all likelihood, the word-of-mouth network effects from this kitchy niche horror comedy will propel it to staying on the charts for weeks to come. (File under <em>marketing techniques</em>: ironic context scenario coupled with inflaming target online male demographic to action via new media virality tools.)</strong></span></p><ul><li><a href="http://www.comscore.com/press/release.asp?press=984"><span>Yahoo Sites Gain Modest Online Traffic Share Gain</span></a><span> - In July 2006, Yahoo!

They pay lip service to the idea of media fragmentation and interactivity, but then continue to fall back on dilapidated, 20th-century channels such as ITV and the Daily Mail.
