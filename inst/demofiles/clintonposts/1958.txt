<br />Hillary Greets Producer Gary Smith at June 9, 2000 Fundraiser Paul Hosted. This set the stage for Gary Smith becoming THE smoking gun that can link Hillary to three false FEC reports. On July 14, 2000, Smith met with Paul, Rosen and Tonken over lunch at Le Dom Restaurant to discuss how much the Gala Concert would cost. Smith's turn key fee of $850,000 was refused by Paul and Hillary Clinton personally intervened, calling Smith that night to reduce his fee because hillary insisted on Smith producing the event at Paul's expense. The following day Rosen called Paul and said that Smith relented after Hillary spoke to him, and reduced his fee by $50,000. ALL participants have since lied about this sequence of events, except that Smith admitted to 60 Minutes scion Mike Wallace that this in fact happened.<br />www.hillcap.org</div>
