Twenty-seven long and bloody days have passed.  Early on there were calls for help.  People, pundits, and political leaders were requesting America assist with negotiations.  They stated someone must <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-rally0806.artaug06,0,6489262.story?coll=hc-headlines-local">stop the fighting.</a>  Many thought only the worldâs singular superpower could do it.  However, the Bush Administration declared the time was not right.  Thus, <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/56884">they waited.</a>  

<p>America allowed its friend and ally Israel to pummel the Lebanese countryside.  Thus far, 700,000 people have been displaced within Lebanon.  Women and children are killed day after day; and all Bush can say is <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060722.html">âHezbollah is to blame.â</a>  Hezbollah captured two Israeli soldiers and had they not done so Lebanon and Israel would be at peace, or so is the world according to the Shrub.</p><p>Hezbollah has fired Katyusha rockets daily.  On some days, hundred sprinkle Israeli territories.  As weeks turn into a month, <a href="http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060803/int/int3.html">these missiles come closer</a> to the capital.  These projectiles are penetrating more deeply into the nation state of Israel.  There are many injuries.  However, the fight must continue, according to Israeli officials.  âWe must win.â</p>

<p>Numerous persons worldwide are disturbed.  When will this crisis end?  Will it ever?</p>

<p>The people of this republic clamor; they ask their President to talk to the warring nations.  Americans insist; we must step in.  The requests fall on deaf ears.  Days pass and the public begs; they pray, âPlease Mr. Bush speak with the Israelis.  Send Condie in.  She will save the day.â  Americans want the Administration to meet with the Lebanese.  Negotiate with Hezbollah.  Work with other nations to reach an accord.  Do something.  The Emperor delays.  </p>

<p>Mr. Bush, with the blessings of his Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, continues to explain, the time will come.  For now, <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2006-07-13-voa6.cfm">âIsrael has the right to defend herself.â</a>  </p>

<p>However, ultimately, after all the aggression and all the assertions Bush and his Bunch did enter the fray.  Diplomatic talks did begin.  They <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/08/03/mideast.rice/index.html">progress</a> slowly.  However, days ago an announcement was made; an agreement had been reached.    </p>

<p>This morning a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060807.html">press conference was held.</a>  King George II and the lovely Miss Rice <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1151AP_Bush_Rice_Text.html">met with journalists.</a>  They made a statement and took questions. <blockquote>Secretary Rice and diplomats from other countries are developing United Nations resolutions to bring about a cessation of hostilities and establish a foundation for lasting peace. </p>

<p>The first resolution, which the Security Council is now considering, calls for a stop of all hostilities.  Under its terms, Hezbollah will be required to immediately stop all attacks; Israel will be required to immediately stop all offensive military operations.</blockquote></p>

<p>The President and his pride are pleased; yet, <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=2281231">those concerned are not.</a>  Some ask, âWhy does the text of the resolution state âall hostilitiesâ <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/07/bush.mideast.ap/index.html">must stop,</a> and then clarify, Hezbollah is required to stop all attacks; Israel need only end offensive operations. â  Why is there a cessation and <a href="http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/739049.html">no ceasefire?</a> </p>

<p>Bush explains, a resolution is not requested or required because <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0607/S00421.htm">âroot causesâ</a> must be addressed.  We are reminded of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/69331.htm">statement Secretary Rice made weeks ago,</a> âA ceasefire would be a false promise if it simply returns us to the status quoâ.<blockquote>A second resolution, which the Security Council will begin working on as soon as possible, will help establish a sustainable and enduring cease-fire.</blockquote>Perchance, that armistice will address the âroot causes.â</p>

<p>Dear reader, you might note that I referred to <a href="http://www.spacewar.com/reports/The_Root_Cause_Of_War_In_The_Middle_East_999.html">âroot causesâ</a> twice within a given paragraph.  I am being redundant, perhaps, to make a point.  I know not.  I only understand that the term must be reiterated over and over, and over again.  At least that is my assumption, for I hear the President and his persuasive Secretary of State using the same phrase repetitively.  I began to count the number of usages in todayâs speech and then again, within answer; however, I lost count early on.</p>

<p>Just before the meeting began, I was watching <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0608/07/ltm.05.html">an interview</a> with Former Senate Majority Leader, also Mideast Envoy for the Clinton administration, George Mitchell.  Soledad OâBrien of Cable News Network and the esteemed Mr. Mitchell were discussing the Middle East situation and possible solutions.</p>

<p>During this dialogue, Ms. OâBrien asked, âIf you were advising this president, what would you tell him to do to solve this crisis now?â<br />
 <br />
Former Senator Mitchell replied, <blockquote>Well, the administration was very slow to get involved.  It has concentrated all of its effort, resources, and attention on Iraq over the past few years, and as a result, the central concern, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, really hasn't had the attention it deserves.  But now after a slow start, even in the past few weeks, they're into it.  And I think what they've got to do is persevere and make it clear that they're going to stay with this until it's resolved. </p>

<p>The problem has been that, other than Iraq, <strong>the administration's involvement, particularly in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict, has been episodic, irregular -- come in one day, go out next week.</strong> I think they have to say -- the president has to make clear that they're determined to stay with this and get an ultimate resolution.  </p>

<p>The second point is -- I simply don't agree with Secretary Rice's formulation that <strong>here's our resolution, if you're not for it, you're not for peace. That's the attitude that I think has reduced American credibility around the world.  That we've presented this, we know what is best, and if you don't agree with us, you're not a good person.</strong>  That's not the approach that they should be taking.  It ought to be, here's an effort, let's all sit down and talk together.  Let's listen to the concerns of people.  Let's try to work them out.  In the end, you may not be able to get everybody on board, but I think that's a better approach.  ?<br />
And the third thing is, this isn't going to be resolved in any final way until Syria is involved.  This is on Syria's border.  They're exposed to...</blockquote>Ms. OâBrien interjects, inquiring, âDirect negotiations, you mean, with the U.S.?â</p>

<p>The former Middle East Envoy replies,<blockquote>We ought to be talking to them.  And I would be amazed if there were not indirect negotiations.  To say they're bad people, we won't talk to them, has the benefit of clarity and it's easily understood.  But when you want someone to do something, it's hard to get them to do it if you won't talk to them.</blockquote>Thus we have it, the root cause stated clearly.  I think the <a href="http://electronicintifada.net/v2/article5246.shtml">âroot causeâ</a> is not Hezbollah; nor would I claim that it is Israel, or Lebanon.  For me, the âroot causeâ for wars worldwide, be they in the Middle East or elsewhere is the same.  It is the babyish Bush Bunch attitude, âYou are either with us or against us.â  Play by our rules or you cannot play at all.  Tantrums, what tantrums, I just refuse to talk to you until . . . Welcome to the world of Bush; <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-30-mideast-diplomacy_x.htm?csp=36">battles are blazing.</a>  Rome is on fire and Nero plays the fiddle, foolishly.</p>
