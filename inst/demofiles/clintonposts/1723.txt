<br />Today I got some time off from my busy schedule and finally got a chance to see Al Gore's movie An Inconvenient Truth.  I thought it was wonderfully done and am now totally convinced that he intends to run for president.  Throughout the movie he detailed his political life, included Katrina and hinted at how the current administration was responsible for most of the aftermath, and he included how the current administration has done virtually nothing toward fixing the problem of global warming.  The movie seemed to send the message that the situation is bad and getting worse, but something can be done about it...Al Gore can do something about it.  My friend came to the movie with me and before it we were discussing who we would endorse for the democratic nomination for president in '08.  I said Gore of course and she believed Hillary would be a better choice.  The movie was so powerful that afterwards she was astounded at what a good man Gore was and said that she would definately endorse him over Hillary.  I think that movie may have won Gore not only the nomination for president in 2008, but the election as well.  That is, if enough people see it.  At one point towards the end he said something to the effect that this was a greater threat than terrorists and I think that will hit home with people.  Gore had scientific facts backing up everything he said, and it was a very impressive presentation.  Based on that movie, I think he's going to run for president, and has already started a heck of a campaign for it.</div>
