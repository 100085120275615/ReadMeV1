<br />Think of this as a hidden picture. Try to locate the items I describe<br />
<br />
<span>1. Postcard of Sigfried and Roy before one of them got munched by a tiger. </span>
<br />
<span>2. Stamps from the Georgia Republic featuring Bill and Monica in cartoon form. Sorry Hillary. </span>
<br />
<span>3.An untrasound of my uterus without a baby in it. </span>
<br />
<span>4. A magnet made by an artist in Santa Fe that is his self-portait with green flames coming out of the head and naked women behind him. The picture looks just like my husband.</span>
<br />
<span>5. A magent of a housewife in her green dress that says "ask me how I suffered."</span>
<br />
<span>6. A picture of someone's car that was spraypainted by a pissed of woman. It reads "Hope that pussy was worth it, bastard." I dont think she was very happy about that one. </span>
<br />
<span>7. Sherpa thongs from a catalog. My department head left this in my box with a note saying that my husband is probably the only person who would wear these. She is wrong because he wouldnt wear thongs and obviously others wear them or they wouldnt be in a catalog. Nice thought though. </span>
<br />
<span>8. A very interesting HIV awareness ad. The man is very good looking but sitting in diapers. The ad says something about HIV not being pretty and that sometimes, he craps in his pants and has to wear a diaper. I thoght it was a great ad. </span>
<br />
<span>9. A postcard of a woman dressed as the Statue of Liberty. She asks for us to give her our lily white asses longing to be free.<br />
</span>
<span>10. A picture of a very large man who is wearing a shirt that says "I beat anorexia."<br />

<br />
<span>11. A 3-d picture of the last pope. He looks so young and healthy in that picture. That is how I want to remember him. Oh, and I have a pope-on-a-rope in my shower. </span>
<br />
<span>12. A picture of Miss Cleo- the world's best psychic. </span>
<br />
<span>13. A postcard from Pop Pops reminding us of the fun and good flavors we are missing by not living in NM. We want to open a pop-pop franchise. It is a great, weird flavored shaved ice. Not your usual shaved ice. And sometimes, they go crazy and pour it over soft serve ice cream.<br />
