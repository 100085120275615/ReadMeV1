<p>I took a look at Ahmadinejad's blog and tedious stuff it is in my view - so far anyway. One thing that does occur to me - he won't be geting jailed for blogging like other Iranians have.</p>

<p>I was very surprised by Ahmadinejad's blog...read the first entry...talks about the poverty he was raised in and the criminal spending by the shah on the celebration of 2500 years of Iranian civilization. The farsi version blog is very poetic, haven't read the english version of it, so I will take O'donell's word on it. I hear the supreme religous leader is going to start one, or already has one.<br /><br />Wouldn't it be interesting if all world leaders had a blog?</p>

<p>Revolutionary, I'm afraid it would be very boring. I hope someone will photoshop a pic of his in a nice cosy Sonia-style: Ahmadinejad blogging in nude would make the news I think...as long as his ugly head is covered is fine with me.<br /><br />Sonia, are you going to comment on his blog? You find him intelligent...or maybe we all should link to him...</p>

<p>Redwine,<br /><br />I find Himmler and Lenin intelligent too... I won't comment on his blog - Iran might soon have nukes and I don't think Tongan Navy is strong enough to repel an Iranian invasion in case he would find me cute and wanted to kidnap me... Better if he doesn't even know that I exist...<br /><br />Rev,<br /><br />All world leaders should have a blog. I agree his first enry is interesting.<br /><br />Jams,<br /><br />You never know. Some ayatollah might decide that blogging is evil and he could be in a lot of trouble...

<p>Holy christ on a bike! Not sure which makes me happier: the ceasefire or the fact that the missing students = false alarm. On Joseph Lieberman, am not surprised in the slightest considering his Jewish heritage. Please somebody tell me am very wrong. Ahmadinejad blogging? I cannot phathom that. Blimey!!! On a serious note, I think he is a very smart dude. <br /><br />Thanks for posting.</p>

<p>I think you are a little optimistic about Lieberman's chances.  My prediction is that the 46% polling is going to be his ceiling and that number will be coming down.  I think it is highly likely that Lamont will be the next senator from CT.</p>

<p>Checked out Ahmadinejad's site. Besides a little biographical info he gets right into it. Our western culture and values are an "infestation" to Islamic culture. (I don't think Brokeback Mountain will be shown at the Teheran Multiplex anytime soon)<br />Also, a curious thing, the comment section is not really a comment section. He is not asking for comments, only questions. We ask, HE tells us. Kind of like the ORACLE at Delphi.</p>

<p>I have my doubts that Ahmadinejad will link to Maryam's blog.  I couldn't get on his blog, too much traffic.<br /><br />I just got on from your link.  Quite slick.  You are correct, he is so underestimated.<br /><br />I could see a McCain/Lieberman coalition or party.  McCain is not liked by Republicans, ad Lieberman is hated by Dems.  They can do a Perot thing.</p>

<p><i>But because of everything that happened in England, I don't feel like a complete paranoid.</i><br /><br />I think after nearly a week, it is time to start looking at âwhat happened in Englandâ. And the answer very possibly is ânot muchâ. <br /><br />The news of anything coming out of the investigation is deafening in its silence. We were told that the police had to act because a terrorist act was âimminentâ yet none of the arrested had bought any plane tickets but some of them <i>didnât even have a passport</i>! <br /><br />We were told that these people had been under surveillance for over a year yet the âevidenceâ of the âimminent attackâ came not from this police work but from Pakistani security forces which, maybe, tortured someone to get this âevidenceâ. <br /><br />Itâs starting to look to me that these were not âbin Laden terroristsâ but jihad dreamers who had a vague plot to do something. <br /><br />If the British police have, yet again, fucked tings up then race relations in Britain is in big trouble.</p>

<p>Bernard Lewis has done some fantastic work to explain the Islamicism and anti-semitism coming from Iran and Al Qaeda.  It has absolutely nothing to do with the West per se as it does their desire to return to the Persian (in the case of Iran) and Islamic glory of the 13th century.  It was manifest in Ahmadenijad's interview with Wallace.  In an interesting aside on the interview, one of the things CBS edited out was a comment by Ahmadenijad, "we are the spiritual leaders of the world."<br /><br />For those who support him as a U.S. foil, like some do Castro and Chavez, this should scare the snot out of you.  Not only is the guy smart, he is focused.  His turning the question of Hezbollah on Wallace and preparation for the nuclear question was telling.<br /><br />One can only hope that the virulent, anti-war, blame America, leftist crowd, making up the base of the Democrats gets blown away with a Lieberman win.<br /><br />Blaming the 7/7, Madrid attack, 9/11 and the foiled plot to blow up trans Atlantic planes on U.S. foreign policy and racism is like blaming the 3rd grade teacher that required him to stay after class for cheating on the murderous behavior of a serial killer.  Another post hoc ergo propter hoc flaw in logic.</p>

<p>Sonia,<br /><br />You are correct, Lieberman got 48% of the Democratic vote in the Democratic primary.  What percentage of those voters, do you think will be turned off by his insistence of not abiding by the results of the primary, leaving the Democratic party and running in a party called "Connecticut of Lieberman"?  I would venture to say that the numbers will be significant.  In addition, Lamont will now have the "full" support of all the big Democratic prime-time players; the Clintons, the DSCC, Obama, CT's other beloved senator Dodd, John Edwards, etc.  Lieberman will have at most 5 Dem Senators and then the Republican Party.  Most of his money is going to have to continue to come from lobbyists and now Republican donors.<br /><br />This is going to get very very ugly, and there is one thing I can tell you for certain, he will NOT win easily.  He may win, but not easily.</p>

<p>An addition and a correction:<br />Lieberman's party is called "Connecticut for Lieberman".  Don't you think he should have called it, "Lieberman for Connecticut".  I think the power of being a senator for 18 years has gone to his head.<br /><br />Additionally, your point about Lieberman being an incumbent being a positive.... Not this year.  I wouldn't want to be an incumbent this year in a competitive race, especially if you are a "pro Iraq war" incumbent.  I'm not making a value judgement here, just stating a fact about the current US environment.</p>
