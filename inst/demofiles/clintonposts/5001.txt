<span>As of late I have been writing for <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com">RealClearPolitics</a>.  My main focus has been on the 2006 midterm elections. <br /></span><p><span><br />My specialty is writing <i>against</i> the conventional wisdom. This is not to say that the CW is wrong all the time. It is to say that, when it is right, there is no need for me to parrot it! So, most of the time, when you read my work, you will note that I am going against the grain.<br /></span></p><p><span><br />Below are links to my most recent writings on the 2006 midterms:<br />1. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-11_28_05_JC.html">2006: A Status Quo Election</a>.  This article makes the point that, while we should expect the Democrats to gain seats in this midterm election, there are <i>structural</i> phenomena which should prevent them from acquiring either chamber of Congress. <br />2. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-1_17_06_JC.html">The Abramoff Effect</a>. The current political climate created by the Abramoff scandal is not of a kind that we should expect the Democrats to net any extra seats in Congress.<br />3. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-1_31_06_JC.html">Will the Republicans Suffer a Sixth Year Slump?</a>  The Short answer is no.  The reason is that sixth year slumps do not actually exist independent of normal electoral processes.<br />4. <a href="http://realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-12_6_05_JC.html">Poll Watching and Congressional Elections</a>. There are so many stinkin' polls out there, all of which claim to say something of relevance for the midterm. Not all of them really do, though. I go through which ones to watch and which to ignore.<br />5. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-2_10_06_JC.html">A Prediction for 2006, Part 1</a>. This column lays out the methodological and theoretical groundwork for making a prediction about the midterms. Contrary to most in the pundit class, of which I do not really consider myself a member, I think that a prediction, a <i>specific</i> prediction, is possible.<br />6. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-2_15_06_JC.html">Part II</a>.  My number -- 224 R, 211 D.<br /><p><br />Below are links to my recent work on subjects other than the 2006 midterms.<br />1. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-1_17_06_JC2.html">Condi Says She's Not Running: Believe It</a>. The bottom line is that the Secretary of State job is not one from which somebody can seek the presidency today. Since Condi has no intention of leaving it, we can expect that she has no intention of being promoted from it.<br />2. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/bushs_mandate_misread.html">Bush's Mandate Misread</a>. Why did Bush have such a lousy 2005? He misunderstood what the voters said on 11-2-04. He should have read Schattschneider!<br />3. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/hillary_is_the_frontrunner_is.html">Hillary Is The Frontrunner.  Is That Where She Wants To Be?</a>  Not as a Democrat!  Her party is historically very cruel to its frontrunners.<br />4. Intelligent Design vs. Evolutionism.  I did two brief pieces on that <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/wilson_on_id_1.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/the_third_party_in_the_debate_1.html">here</a>.  Never got so much email in my life. <br />5. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/is_bush_finished.html">Is Bush Finished?</a>  Lots of people tend to think so.  I don't. <br />6. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/an_early_handicap_of_2008_1.html">An Early Handicap of 2008</a>.  At this early date, we can say with confidence a few people who definitely will <i>not</i> be nominees.<br />7. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/the_problem_of_psychoanalyzing_1.html">The Problem with Psychoanalyzing Bush</a>.  Remember that <i>Newsweek</i> "Bush in a Bubble" article? Here is my reaction to that type of work.<br />8. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/measuring_media_bias.html">Measuring Media Bias</a>.  An article in December's <i>Quarterly Journal of Economics</i> comes up with an objective measure and indeed finds a leftwardly tilt to the media. This was my first take on the article. My opinion of it has declined subsequently, but it is a good first step in trying to move beyond conservatives shouting about a liberal bias and liberals shouting about a conservative bias.<br />9. <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/the_109th_congressso_far_1.html">The 109th Congress So Far</a>.  People have argued that the current Congress has not produced much.  Historically speaking, that is not really true.<br />10.  <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2005/12/bush_and_congress_what_went_wr_1.html">Bush and Congress.  What Went Wrong?</a> He bit off more than he could chew, which is to say that he did not do his homework about what a Congress of his party could and could not do for him.</span></p>
