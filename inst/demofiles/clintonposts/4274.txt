Lindsay is just not getting the same headlines hating on Hillary that she used to. And since she's ready to pick a fight with just about anyone, she picked the very-much-in-the-headlines Jessica Simpson. </p>

<p>Apparently she sent over a round of champaign to Jessica at a LA night club last week. When Jessica failed to thank Lindsay for the gesture, cattiness ensued and Jessica ended up in tears. Brett Ratner, who has been linked romantically to Lindsay Lohan recently, happened to be there and stepped in to break up the scene. </p>

<p>Is the media just blowing this out of proportion, or is Lindsay so attention starved that she has to pick fights with famous people? Not sure, but it's given me a great idea to promote myself. Therefore, Anna Nicole, you and me are ON in the Burger King parking lot tonight! Chicken!</p>
