<strong>PS To Hillary</strong>
<br />Getting Started<br />
<br />Here are a few ideas to help you get started. First clean up the electoral process. George Bush and the radical right have made a mockery of our system. Without fair and honest elections there is no democracy. This is not to say that in the past the Democrats have not done their part to subvert freedom. In fact their disenfranchisement of African American voters is one of the primary causes of our current predicament. The Democrats have always been slow learners, when they learn at all. It took them almost a century to see the error of their ways. But see it they did. <br />
<br />Now the Republicans have not only picked up the mantle, they have extended it to everyone who does not think (sic) like they do. And they are not satisfied with just preventing those who disagree with them from voting; they now try to change the vote of those who slip by and do vote. This is the state of America in 2006. You want to be remembered by history, then lead the fight to rebuild and restore democracy from its shattered remnants brought on by the Republican Revolution.   <br />
<br />The first step in this new revolution is to return to all paper ballots in all elections. There is no argument that can be made against this. Cost and waste, what is the cost of freedom? How is it a waste to promote the fair and accurate count of each vote? Either your vote counts or it doesnât. You either have a democracy or you donât. Our current situation gives proof that just saying you do does not make it true.<br />
<br />The publicâs right to quickly know, to know what; a number pulled from an electronic hat or who actually got the most votes? Polls should be open for several days; we should promote participation not hinder it. All exit polls should be strictly prohibited. The nationâs not knowing will cause chaos. Now thatâs a good one. In 2000 we didnât know for 5 weeks, and the chaos only began after 5 right wing Supreme Court justices went against their life long proclaimed belief in states rights and dictated George Bush to be the next President. <br />
<br />All attempts to prohibit a fair process should be dealt with for what they are. They are not just pranks or unintentional actions by over zealous campaign workers. They are deliberate attempts to subvert the will of the people. They are an attempt to place the perpetratorsâ jackboot on the throat of freedom. All such actions should be prosecuted to the fullest and the penalties severe not just a few months in a local country club facility or a slap on the wrist. The politics of Donald Segretti, Karl Rove and Lee Atwater are the politics of death for democracy.<br />
<br />All federal campaigns must be publicly financed. Since 1976 with the <a href="http://www.oyez.org/oyez/resource/case/57/">Buckley v Valeo </a>Supreme Court decision the one man one vote democratic concept was codified into the one dollar one vote malignancy of Corporate Domination. The costs will be minute compared to the savings made by putting an end to the corporate welfare sustained by subsidies and tax breaks. An election process no longer bought and paid for by the privileged few is a necessity for a democracy.<br />
<br />Hillary, these changes are the easy part and they must be changed before the real work to âform a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, â can be started.<br />
