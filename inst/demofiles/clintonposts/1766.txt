<span>I wish sometimes that I was African American or just plain black. It seems from the media that black folks enjoy their life more than us white muts. All the songs are about having money to spend on lavish doo-dads like grillz (see photo above and Nelly lyrics below), graphic sex or selling someone elses sex a.k.a pimping out ho's. I told my step-daughter about my fantasy of being black while we were digging on some hip-hop tunes and she thinks I am silly. I don't know how p.c. it is to wish I was black, and perhaps I don't care. I don't think I am being a biggot about it. I have never found race hate all that much fun so I don't think I am a klan man. I know one thing being low on the economic ladder bites no matter what color you are. Being lied to sucks no matter what color you are. Being sick is a bummer no matter the color of your skin. Being used for other peoples foul plans is a raw deal too. I wish I didn't wish.<br />
