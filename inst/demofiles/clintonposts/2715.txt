<div><p>I am not dead, just no time to post!</p>

<p>During the weekend we got to judge the Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals' Pet Flix contest. We saw eleven videos and I think the winner was probably a unanimous vote among the judges. See it <a href="http://www.spca.org/site/PageServer?pagename=petflix2006">here</a>. Click on "World Cat 2006." Seriously, I laughed all the way through it. It is cats playing the final game of the World Cup, and it's a scream. The second place winner, "La Chienne Noir," is good also. And the third place winner, "Adopt from the SPCA," was a high school class project with some cute acting and cute dogs and cats.</p>

<p>One of the reasons I've not been posting so often this summer is that I'm just really tired of the whinging denial that so many people seem to be in about the state of the world. Are people really falling for the fiction that the media and the Left put forward about how we're not in a fight for our survival? Sometimes it seems that way. </p>

<p>One of my character failings, a lifelong one, is that I've never had much patience with the dimwitted. Only my own dimwittedness doesn't aggravate me; everyone else's does.</p>

<p>Like this giant, blubbering dimwit Boston Globe columnist <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/08/23/bush_clings_to_a_lost_cause_in_iraq/">Joan Vennochi</a>, able to believe in fairy tale because "...rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf":</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><em>George W. Bush sounds increasingly like your average defiant teenager. The teenager won't clean his room, and the president won't leave Iraq.</em></p>

<div id="articleEmbed"><div id="articleTools" class="embed"><div class="toolsHeader"><em>The president's latest news conference was another installment of rebel with a cause that a shrinking number of Americans believe in.</em></div></div></div>

<p><em>''We're not leaving so long as I'm president,'' promised - or threatened - Bush.</em></p>

<p><em>Acknowledging that public support for the war continues to wane, the president said, ''These are challenging times, and they're difficult times, and they're straining the psyche of our country.'' But as Senator John Kerry correctly pointed out, ''The American psyche isn't the problem. The problem is this administration's disastrous Iraq policy.'' In fact, the presidential psyche, not the national psyche, is a big problem.</em></p>

<p><em>Bush, the stubborn, won't leave Iraq. And even worse, he won't admit mistakes relative to getting us there in the first place, or military miscues since, when it comes to carrying out the mission, he dooms us to travel the same misguided path as long as he remains in the White House.</em></p>

<p><em>What's a nation to do? Ground the commander in chief for the rest of his term and take away his car keys? </em></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Here's what you could do, Joan: grow up. Get over the 2000 election. Open your eyes to the thundering hordes of Islamofascists out of a single-digit century who would rather kill you than shut down your newspaper and pop an abaya on your feminist curls faster than you can say "thanks, Bill Clinton."</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is time to <a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/podhoretz.htm">read Norman Podhoretz' great essay</a> again.</p>

<p dir="ltr">And his newest, "<a href="http://www.commentarymagazine.com/files/podhoretz_0906.htm">Is the Bush Doctrine Dead?"</a></p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr"><span><em>I<span class="SMALLCAPS"><span>n recent</span></span> months, we have been bombarded with reports of the death of the Bush Doctrine. Of course, there have been many such reports since the doctrine was first promulgated at the start of what I persist in calling World War IV (the cold war being World War III). Almost all of them were written by the realists and liberal internationalists within the old foreign-policy establishment, and they all turned out to resemble the reports of Mark Twainâs deathâwhich, he famously said, had been âgreatly exaggerated.â Nothing daunted by this, the critics and enemies of Bush are now at it yet again. This time, however, their ranks have been swollen by a number of traditional conservatives who were never comfortable with the doctrine bearing his name and who have now moved from discomfort to outright opposition.</em> </span></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/column.aspx?UrlTitle=are_bushs_critics_right&ns=TonyBlankley&dt=08/23/2006&page=full&comments=true">Tony Blankley</a> takes a look at what the world would look like in two years if President Bush followed the advice of all his critics. A frightening and completely probable scenario.</p>

<p dir="ltr">And speaking of what the values of the Left do for us at home, one Hollywood writer lays <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/BurtPrelutsky/2006/08/21/actors_and_other_idiots">it out for us</a>. This is too true. </p>

<p dir="ltr">Today I take a break from office work and go to Fair Park to judge Holiday Corner at the Creative Arts Department of the great State Fair of Texas, which opens in September. So a day of holiday crafts, piles of quilts, and a roomful of jellied and pickled fruits and vegetables may clear my palate. One hopes.</p></div>
