<div>Dear Senator Feinstein,<br />
<br />Thanks for your response.<br />
<br />Please keep this in mind: Taxes on the middle class are OUT OF CONTROL.<br />
<br />In California, the effective tax on income is 50% when you combine Federal taxes (income, FICA, et cetera), 10% California income tax, property tax, and 8.25% sales tax. The greatest expense that I have in my life is taxes, more than 50% of my income each year.<br />
<br />Congress is taxing this country's citizens TO DEATH, and I, for one, am sick of it, especially in light of the enormous sums of money Congress WASTES on absolutely nothing but its own aggrandizement.<br />
<br />Forget about Iraq. Forget about homeland security. Forget about about just about every other issue this Congress frets and feuds over. The number-one issue, to my mind (and vote), is tax reform.<br />
<br />While I hate the AMT, I will not be satisfied with a band-aid. If you don't support the Fair Tax, then propose something better. It is criminal and a recipe for ruin if the wasteful spending and outrageous taxation is allowed to go on one single day longer. If I managed my checkbook the way this government manages the budget, I would be bankrupt, if not in jail.<br />
<br />It's time for a change -- and for aggressive, courageous, adult action. Stop spending money, and make this country THE absolutely best place in the world to invest and save by eliminating ALL the ridiculous tax complexity and by slashing taxes to a bare minimum. The rest will take care of itself.<br />
<br />God help us if Hillary is the next president. She will surely tax us into oblivion.<br />
<br />Best,<br />TR
