<span>Would you like to be sexually harrassed by this guy? He thinks you would. In fact, he thinks you'd like to be harrassed by any man who takes it into his head to harrass you. Here are some examples of the scintillating cultural analysis, oh no, sorry, I meant to say <em>stinking verbal vomit</em> from his show.<br />
</span>
<br />
<br />
<strong>"Some of these babes, I'm telling you, like the sexual harassment crowd. They're out there protesting what they actually wish would happen to them sometimes."</strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong></strong>
<br />
<strong>"Oh, gosh, that hurts, my friends. It reminds me of my first wife. Ah! Gee! It is just painful to hear this, and then she [Hillary Clinton] starts yelling everywhere -- Dawn, you can smile. She's in there shaking her head. She's -- she's here in a den of sexists, folks, and she puts up such a game front. Chauvinists, I should say. We're not sexists, we're chauvinists -- we're male chauvinist pigs, and we're happy to be because we think that's what men were destined to be. We think that's what women want."</strong>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>"Iâm not talking -- I know how many of you want to be sexually harassed -- thatâs not what Iâm asking. But if somebody wants to hire you to look good for whoever is the first to walk in the door every day, why not, if thatâs your asset?"</strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong></strong>
<br />
<strong>"Now, I have a real-world question for those of you women in the audience. Just something Iâd like to know. How many of you in the secrecy and privacy of your own dreams and hopes would love to be hired as eye candy?"</strong>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Are you feeling harrassed yet? Are you enjoying it? No?<br />
<br />
</span>
<span></span>
<span>Imagine being hired as eye candy for Rush .... that thought's better than a cold shower any day. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Obviously Rush is a seriously <em>professional</em> jerk and prides himself on it, but it's not a little scary that an idiot like this can get famous just by spouting shit. Can you imagine what would happen if a female DJ started saying similar stuff about men? I wonder how long she'd be on the air.<br />
<br />As the women at Feministing.com put it "Ah, you gotta love Rush. Well, in that âI want to stab you in the eyeâ kind of way."<br />

<strong>p.s</strong> can't you just imagine our internet troll friends building little shrines to Rush in their houses? </span>
