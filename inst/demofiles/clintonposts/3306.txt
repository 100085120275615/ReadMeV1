<div>It happened today.  See, when I voted for Bush in 2000 (gulp, it's true) I did so hoping that he'd use the surplus to pay down the debt while returning some of it to the people, and reform social security.  Those were my voting issues.  I cast that ballot with the sincere hope that no vacancies on the Supreme Court would open up and that in 2004 I would have a palatable Democratic nominee to vote for and he could then fill whatever vacancies developed.  By and large my plan did not work out.<br />
<br />So today one of my greater political fears was realized when the court's centrist-in-chief called it quits.  Of course, we could have flat out lost a liberal judge, but this is a blow to me personally because I don't identify that well with either bloc.  I don't know Sandra's voting record thoroughly - it might not match my ideals well - but at least it can't be so clearly labeled conservative or liberal.<br />
<br />I predicted in a couple IMs tonight that this has the potential to be the biggest political crisis in our country since Watergate.  It has a long ways to go to beat out Iran-Contra, the Clinton impeachment, the government shutdown, or the 2000 election, but I think it may well get there.  Don't be surprised to see the Senate use the "nuclear option"  (what a silly label that is anyway) and forever end the useful tool of filibusters in our system.  That's just the starting point of what's at stake with this nomination.<br />
<br />The atmosphere in Washington must be incredible right now; the political venom is probably gushing down the hill.  Just hours after hearing about the vacancy the forces were gathering in my inbox to tell me all about the evils of judicial activism.  Take this example from Senator Leahy (D-Vermont) writing for Democracy for America (the PAC that grew out of the Dean campaign):<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I voted against Janice Rogers Brown, a judge quoted telling conservative audiences that the New Deal "mark[ed] the triumph of our own socialist revolution," and that elderly Americans who depend on Social Security "blithely cannibalize their grandchildren."</blockquote>
<br />As an aside, I had assumed that the nominees so toxic to Democrats were wholly evil, but clearly on many issues this Brown lady and I think alike.  What great quotes!  Anyway, with both sides so freely tossing around the label of judicial activism, the concept is useless in determining this appointment.<br />
<br />Instead, I hope the unifying factor can be the wisdom offered up by Harvard Law Professor William J. Stuntz, as he offered these widely applicable comments on the Ten Commandments decision:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Symbols like the ones the Supreme Court haggled about give the impression that Christianity and the government are somehow in cahoots with each other. That's a dangerous impression, and a false one. It's a small step from the idea that the government endorses Christianity to an idea that is much worse: that Christianity endorses the government. Christians are the big losers in that transaction. Western Europe is filled with Christian symbols -- Christian Democrats are a leading political party in several countries -- but almost entirely devoid of Christians. Christianity does not thrive when political parties take its name and capitol lawns showcase its precepts. On the contrary, it thrives when it stays as far from those things as possible.<br />
<br />The government thrives, too. Religious conservatives and secular liberals should be able to agree on this much: teaching good morals is not a job for the Texas legislature or the Kentucky courts -- or any legislature or court. Making just laws is hard enough, and our government isn't so good at that. Teaching virtue is incomparably harder. Personally, I'd rather they stuck to the laws."</blockquote>
<br />How true.  No matter where you stand on the pivotal political issues of our time, I hope we can all agree that the intellectual spaces where we discuss faith and justice/rights can remain distinct.  If we acknowledge this basic need, the process of settling this nomination amicably could actually better our nation.<br />
<br />But I'll brace for one of the culture war's holiest battles.</div>
