BagNews <a href="http://bagnewsnotes.typepad.com/bagnews/2005/11/left_is_right_a.html">examines</a> images of Condoleezza Rice and Bill and Hillary Clinton in Israel this week.  One picture of Hillary smiling next to a map of the Israeli security "fence" caught my eye.<br /><br />I had a post all written up saying that the Israeli security wall is bad in the long run, since it adds to the resentment some Muslims feel toward Israel and the U.S.  But when I got to the sentence where I would have said, "Sure, in the short term, it prevents a few suicide bombings..." I realized that right now, Israel does need a wall, resentment be damned.
