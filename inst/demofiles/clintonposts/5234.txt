As many age and grow saddened that the pleasures of this life diminish and are to soon come to an end, they often cope with this existential crisis by criticizing the young for behaviors they themselves use to participate in and wish for future generations lives of struggle and material deprivation.  Normally, such disgruntled reflection provides a kind of psychological outlet through which to vent pent up frustrations and anxieties, however, it can be cause for concern when those making these kinds of complaints implement such ramblings as the foundation of public policy.<br />
<br />
According to WorldNetDaily.com, in a commencement address at Long Island University and in a speech before the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Hillary Clinton declared to the youth of the nation that &#8220;work is not a four letter word&#8221; and that the young have a &#8220;sense of entitlement&#8221; having grown up in a &#8220;culture that has a premium on instant gratification&#8221;.<br />
<br />
Isn&#8217;t a Clinton the last one that should be lecturing us on the perils of instant gratification as the old man pretty much wrote the book on this behavioral pathology throughout the 1990&#8217;s?  However, it must be noted that what the wicked witch of the east is talking about is not so much the wastefulness and licentiousness endemic to the ruling elite but rather codespeak of revolutionary globalists that the American people enjoy too high a standard of living and must have Third World levels of squalor imposed upon them.<br />
<br />
For in justifying her comments, the battle ax continued, &#8220;I just want to set the bar high because we are in a competition for the future.&#8221;  Yet I wonder how much of her salary and book proceeds she is willing to forego for the sake of national productivity.  <br />
<br />
And it is highly doubtful she is speaking out against welfare recipients, the backbone of the contemporary Democratic Party.  Rush Limbaugh observes in a quote in the WorldNetDaily account that Senator Clinton is sponsoring a bill to build 15,000 houses with high speed Internet for those on low income.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s bad enough to build houses for the indolent at government expense, but how can you justify giving them high speed Internet?  I ask the junior witch from New York who will be getting instant gratification under such a program without working for it?<br />
<br />
As the woman who just a few years ago realized &#8220;janitors are people to&#8221; as if this was some kind of breakthrough in the Grand Unified Theory, Hillary isn&#8217;t exactly in touch with those outside the New York/Washington loony bin.  After all, her own spawn pulls down a six figure salary as a &#8220;consultant&#8221;, basically a position where she sits around doing nothing for which her primary qualification is having sprung from their loins of her progenitors.<br />
<br />
Apparently, Hillary fails to realize that as politicians like her continue to expand education budgets to the point where almost anyone can acquire one irrespective of whether or not the actually deserve one in terms of aptitude, the value of an education has been diminished to such an extent that pursuing a degree provides the recipient with little economic advantage as college graduates today barely qualify today for jobs --- if the positions have not already been shipped overseas --- that used to be filled by high school graduates.  Eventually, Americans will need a PhD in Economics just to say, &#8220;Hi, welcome to Wal-Mart.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Maybe since Hillary has lived high on the hog for so long, it&#8217;s time she gave back to the community and all that other it takes a village drivel and herself partake of that low-paid menial labor the rest of us are suppose to be content with.<br />
<br />
It seems she is not the only Clinton having done one thing and imposed something else on what to them are the lesser classes of the human race.  Apart from his whoring around, one of the things Bill Clinton was most famous for was his love of nutritionally ambiguous snacks.  However, if this former President no longer in office has his way, he will hold unprecedented power over what children in public schools will be allowed to ingest; no doubt making them fit little minions of the New World Order in that not only will they have lean bodies fit for all kinds of public project slave labor but also be of diminished critical capacity unaccustomed to questioning what is demanded of them since they will have been conditioned that it is their place to pliantly accept the decisions made for their lives by those claiming to be their betters.<br />
<br />
According to an accord hashed out between the Alliance For A Healthier Generation (an entente consisting of the William J. Clinton Foundation and the American Heart Association) and Cadbury Schwepps, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, and the American Beverage Association, only low calorie and nutritious drinks are to be sold in the nation&#8217;s public schools.  So while Bill Clinton spent a goodly portion of his Presidency shoving sweet things into his mouth and into the mouths of others (some while on their knees under the desk in the Oval Office where Reagan wouldn&#8217;t even remove his suit coat much less unzip his pants), if these captains of industry and institutional eleemosynary have their way, school children will be denied the decision regarding what far less offensive syrupy substances they may take into the human body.<br />
<br />
Those hoodwinked by all the hype about an obesity epidemic relieved that someone has stepped forward to address this alleged crisis have missed the point.  Encase some have forgotten or prefer to live in a liberal fantasyland, Bill Clinton is not the President anymore.  Shouldn&#8217;t he be out building houses for the homeless or something?<br />
<br />
Is it just me or is anyone else as disturbed as I am that unelected personalities not even in the government responsible to no one are able to exert such control over the lives of average Americans as to what we&#8217;ll be having for lunch?  Shouldn&#8217;t the free market influenced by the decisions of individual consumers determine what is on the menu?<br />
<br />
Those still not convinced will respond that the concordat only affects public school cafeterias and vended snacks.  Students are perfectly free to bring their own junk food from home.<br />
<br />
Maybe so for now.  But once the initial details are worked out, what is to stop Clinton and his minions from conspiring together and issuing an edict that henceforward food manufacturers will only produce healthy foods such as beansprouts and seaweed?  Furthermore, few will be left to resist such a decree as most will have been conditioned since childhood that theirs is not to reason why but to submit cheerfully to the plans both mundane and grandiose of the vaunted overlords.<br />
<br />
Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.  America has yet to fully recover from it&#8217;s last go-a-round with the Clintons.  I doubt the country could take much more with Hillary in the White House and Bill free to impose his will upon the nation and the world beyond as either a private sector powerhouse or as even Secretary General of the United Nations, as some have proposed, and still retain what little liberty we have remaining.<br />
