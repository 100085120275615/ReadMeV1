<div>That whining you hear from Senators <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/ra/news/stories/s1427655.htm">Ted Kennedy</a> and <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/8/1/12332/74268">Harry Reid</a> over President Bush's recess appointment of John Bolton may be less a symptom of Liberal IdiocyÂ® than of institutional bickering.<br />
<br />We heard pretty much the thing when President Clinton <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/1002994/">appointed</a> James Hormel as Ambassador to Luxembourg in a recess appointment in 1999. Only this time, the whiny Senator was played by a Republican, James Inhofe (R-OK).<br />
<br />Senators are quite creative at finding excuses to whine about Presidential recess appointments. In 1999, for example, Inhofe and Senator Larry Craig (R-ID) were <a href="http://www.thisnation.com/question/010.html">upset</a> that President Clinton recess-appointed Sarah Fox to the National Labor Relations Board, without first notifying the Senate before it left for recess, as tradition dictated. <br />
<br />Last year, Senator Kennedy <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/10/15/84935.shtml">sued</a> to overturn President Bush's recess appointment of William Pryor to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, on the grounds that the recess during which Bush appointed Pryor was not long to count as a real recess. His side lost in an 8-2 vote in the same 11th Circuit.<br />
<br />The bottom line is that Senators hate it when the President dodges the Constitutional requirement for Senate approval of appointments. The Senators do take turns whining on a partisan basis, but it's still an institutional divide, rather than a partisan one.<br />
<br />The bad news for them, of course, is that the Constitution unequivocally states that such appointments are legal. Quoting <a href="http://straylight.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articleii.html">Article II, section 2</a> of the Constitution:<blockquote>[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law ...<br />
<br />... The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.</blockquote>
