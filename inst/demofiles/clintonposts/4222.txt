From June 12 to the 14th I  joined about two thousands progressives (and liberals) who gathered at the Washington Hilton to discuss the future of Democratic party.   At  the  conference named "Take Back America, '' Congressional party leaders Pelosi and Reid as well as  Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, John Kerry and Obama were keynote speakers. </p>

<p>The conference occupied two levels of the ritzy hotel, filling its largest ballrooms and exhibition hall and spilling over into the outdoor gazebo.</p>

<p>Just outside the 45,000-square-foot exhibition hall there were booths representing The Nation, The American Prospect, The Washington Monthly, In These Times, and Ms. Magazine  side by side with television outlets including Politics TV, Free Speech TV RNN TV and of course, Air America.  Inside the exhibit hall there were some 30 political blogs, reflecting the diversity of the progressive movement and  booths containing organization ranging from NOW to ACORN. <br />
I gave out more than 100 copies of my magazine, Shelterforce.</p>

<p>The conference organized by the Campaign for America's Future, of which I am one of 100 founding members, has long battled with centrist Democrats over the direction of the party. </p>
        <p>Senator Reid had an especially good slogan designed to attack Republicans. ÂInstead of coming together to address the serious problems I have just mentioned, Republicans in recent weeks have turned to their three favorite tricks Distort. Distract. And Divide.Â</p>

<p>The mainstream media -Washington Post, NYT--focused on the Democratic Party's divisions over the Iraq war that may influence the direction of this year's midterm elections. As the group gathered in the  Hilton's International Ballroom, a enormous, classy,  column-free contemporary room Clinton won repeated applause for her stands on domestic issues but was met with some boos and chanting when she referred to what she called a difficult conversation, i.e  her long-standing position about timetables for withdrawing U.S forces. "I have to just say it. I do not think it is a smart strategy either for the president to continue with his open-ended commitment, which I think does not put enough pressure on the new Iraqi government, nor do I think it is smart strategy to set a date certain. I do not agree that that is in the best interest of our troops or our country.Â</p>

<p>On the other hand, the forever pandering Sen. Kerry charmed the same (gullible?)  crowd only minutes after Clinton with an impassioned criticism of the war. He said that he  regretted  his initial  support for the Iraq war and reprimanded other politicians, not mentioning Clinton by name, for failing to follow suit.<br />
"It's not enough to argue with the logistics or to argue about the details or the manner of the conflict's execution or the failures of competence, as great as they are," Kerry said. "It is essential to acknowledge that the war itself was a mistake." Great applause followed.</p>

<p>Robert Redford also came  to discuss energy policy and to present an award to the wonderful Leo Gerard, the populist president of the United Steelworkers. His union played an important role in a thing called  the Apollo Project - a labor environmental movement alliance that promotes a program for energy independence and seems to be getting a lot of traction.</p>

<p>Redford said efforts to talk with the Bush administration about energy policy Âare a waste of time. Things will really improve when they're out of there, so the next elections are going to be very important." </p>

<p>In another good move the conference announced the founding of a group called "MomsRising.Â They called on the Democratic Party to adopt "family values" and provide "progressive" solutions to family issues. The group was co-founded by one of MoveOn.org's creators.  "MomsRising" believes taxpayers should fund "family leave ... childcare and healthcare for all children. ÂThis is really about building a movement.,Â said Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner, who co-founded MomsRising with Joan Blades, who also helped create MoveOn.org.</p>

<p>Another highlight was listening to   Rep. Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) who is one of the few members of Congress that is capable of talking radical ideas to common  people  and making them sound mainstream. He   challenged attendees  to take on the "right-wing nuts" on talk radio and demand that local radio stations and newspapers provide "alternative points of view. The fight to allow people to hear different points of view is as important as any other fight, so I would urge people at the grassroots to start taking on the local media," said Sanders, during a panel discussion on the topic of media reform.  Sanders, who is running for the US Senate seat, added,  "If you have a newspaper in your community that does not allow columnists from a progressive perspective, you've got to go challenge those people." </p>

<p>The congressman also criticized news stations that force people "to speak in seven-second sound bites.Â</p>

<p>Now, if you go to the web site below and wait till to end of the news report by Mara Laisson,  you'll here my 7 seconds of fame criticizing Clinton's attempt to burnish her credentials as a centrist not-so-liberal strong-on-national-security centrist.<br />

<p>Despite all the interesting ideas, and I have just touched the surface, there were two disappointing items. There was not enough attention to the issues of affordable housing, community development and the crisis facing inner-city neighborhoods.</p>

<p> And I came away with that sinking feeling that despite the mess we are in,  the  Republicans are so much better at  messaging to their base without offending too many swing voters. Last year, Republicans distributed news releases that labeled Democrats "The party of no plan, the party of no agenda.'' Now they distribute e-mails describing what they call the Democrats' "real agenda ... (as) tax-and-spend liberals intent on impeaching the president and undermining the national defense.''</p>

<p>The conference focused on the way forward to:</p>
