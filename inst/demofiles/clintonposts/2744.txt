<div><p>Is it possible that politics, at times, can get boring? </p>

<p>I know this sounds weird, especially coming from a political blog whose New York State focus should have plenty to write about on a daily basis. But recent political news is just bland. Hillary is leading her potential opponents. Eliot Spitzer is well ahead in his race for governor. Andrew Cuomo is still leading Mark Green and his other Democrat opponents in the Attorney General's race. John Spencer is releasing commercials that go right after Hillary Clinton's national security record, and for some reason, Clinton and her enablers don't like them.</p>

<p>But is any of that "news" earth-shattering? Outside of the K.T. McFarland's campaign suspension for a few days because her daughter got caught shoplifting in Southampton, politics during the past few weeks has been lacking an excitement. OK, it is summer. "Things" don't usually get hot until the general election because all political candidates are trying to narrow their primary "GOTV" lists. Even in politics, people take sometime off during the dog days.</p>

<p>And it is not that I have taken time off this week --- I got real life busy and I didn't have the gumption to force a post up during the day just to fill some unknown quota. When nothing gets me politically excited, I force it and I screw it up.</p>

<p>Well, I am taking the rest of the night off from watching and listening to politics. No Fox News. No Keith Olbermann. No Greta.</p>

<p>I'll just continue to listen to <a href="http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&c=FlexContent&cid=1134268004609">Scott Ferrall</a> on <a href="http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&c=FlexContent&cid=1134268004609">Sirius Satellite Radio's Howard 101 channel</a> for a few more hours. He's talking sports.</p></div>
