</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">MT VERNON, VA -- Senator George Allen (R-Virginia) <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/23/AR2006082301600.html">issued another in an ongoing series of apologies today</a> as his re-election campaign attempts to recover from allegations of racism. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Allen was <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/23/AR2006082301600.html">captured on videotape last week calling Democratic campaign worker S. R. Sidarth a 'macaca,' or monkey, </a>and then welcoming him to America. Sidarth is of Indian descent but was born in Virginia. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Today, Allen admitted to occasionally using other racial slurs in casual conversation. He apologized to <a href="http://obama.senate.gov/">Senator Barack Obama</a> for calling him a <a href="http://www.johncglass.com/racialslurs.htm">jigaboo, jungle bunny, biscuit lips, Sambo, chicken bandit, darkie, ghetto hamster, an Africoon American, </a>and "Senator Buckwheat Bambooma." </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Allen also apologized for calling Senator Hillary Clinton a "rug-munching bull dyke," and for attempting to hire <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cisneros">former HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros </a>to mow his lawn. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Allen's campaign manager Dick Wadhams claimed the use of such terms merely indicates that Senator Allen maintains a colorful vocabulary. He then blamed the liberal media for reporting what the Senator actually said instead of what he felt inside his heart.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In a survey of Virginia voters likely to vote Republican, 42% said they support Allen despite his racist comments, 37% support him because of his racist comments, and 21% said they wished he'd return to his former job as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Allen_%28football%29">coach of the Washington Redskins.</a> </p>  <p class="MsoNormal">
