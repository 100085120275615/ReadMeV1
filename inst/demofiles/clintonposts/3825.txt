But consider the following:<br /><br />1) Create an Enemy:  <br /><br />Nazis took anti-Jewish feelings, made it worse by blaming Jews for everything that was wrong in Germany, and made them the enemy. <br /><br />Republicans took anti-liberal feelings, made it worse by blaming liberals for everything that is wrong with America, and made them the enemy.   <br /><br />Republicans have done such a great job demeaning and demagoging the word "liberal" - as the Nazis did with "Jew" - that Democrats not only have to run away from it, but conservatives use it as a insult ("You're a liberal!") and attached it to their propaganda ("liberal media").    <br /><br />2) Blame Government: <br /><br />Germans didn't trust their government during the 1920s and Hitler used that sentiment to bring the Nazis to power.  <br /><br />Republicans use their mistrust of government to gain power.  <br /><br />3) The Rhetoric: <br /><br />Nazis used rabble rousing speech's to build their party. <br /><br />Republicans use rabble rousing speeches (much more inciteful and inflammatory than Democrats) to secure their base.<br /><br />4) The Propaganda: <br /><br />"The most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly...it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over."<br />- Joseph Geobbels<br /><br />Nazis repeated the same propaganda over and over to brainwash Germans and built their party. <br /><br />Republicans repeat the same propaganda over and over to brainwash Americans to build their party: "liberal media," "cut taxes," "Democrats tax and spend," "Democrats will take your guns away," "Democrats are soft on (fill in the blank)," "Republicans are tough on (fill in the blank)," "Democrats are for big government," "get government out of our lives," "socialized medicine," "government-run health care," "drill in Alaska," "partial birth abortion," "privatize," "deregulate," "let the free market decide," and "John Kerry's a flip-flopper." <br /><br />And they've rolled out two new ones: "personal accounts" and "intelligent design" (Democrats don't have propaganda of their own, except "tax cuts for the rich;" and that's recent).<br /><br />Nazis told Germans not to believe leaflets dropped by British planes before WWII because it was "enemy propaganda." <br /> <br />Republicans brush off negative news stories by saying it came from the "liberal media" or it's "liberal propaganda." <br /> <br />The Nazis had Geobbels to spread their propaganda.<br />The Republicans have Karl Rove, talk radio and Fox News to spread their propaganda.<br /><br />The Nazis produced their own propaganda films, pamphlets and posters.<br />The Bush Administration produced their own propaganda "news" videos - complete with "anchors" and a script - and distributed them to local news outlets. <br /><br />They also paid conservative "columnists" and "reporters" to promote Bush's policy's on TV, radio and in their columns (without disclosing they were being paid to shill).   <br /><br />The White House also planted a partisan conservative "reporter" in the White House Briefing Room to lob blatantly slanted softball questions. <br /><br />"I soon realized that the correct use of propaganda is a true art which has remained practically unknown to the bourgeois parties. Only the Christian-Social movement (see "Religion" below), especially in Lueger's time achieved a certain virtuosity on this instrument, to which it owed many of its success."<br />-Adolf Hitler (Mein Kampf)<br /><br />5) The Brainwashing: <br /><br />Germans believed their party and Hitler, no questions asked. <br />Republicans believe their party and George Bush, no questions asked.<br /><br />Walk into a room with 10 Democrats, and you'll come out with a dozen opinions. <br />Walk into a room with 10 Republicans, and you'll come out with one opinion.  <br /><br />Are there any Republicans that can think for themselves?  Or do they need Rush Limbaugh to tell them what to think, what to say, and what "talking points" to use in an argument with a "lib" (speaks volumes when they describe themselves as a "Rush Republican," doesn't it?)? <br /><br />"The essence of propaganda consists in winning people over to an idea so sincerely, so vitally, that in the end they succumb to it utterly and can never escape from it." <br />- Goebbels <br /><br />6) One Party: <br /><br />In 1933 the Nazis declared themselves the only party in Germany. <br />The goal of Karl Rove and the GOP is to create a "one-party nation."  <br /><br />Republicans got a good start by using drastic gerrymandering to achieve "one party" dominance in the US House of Representatives and just might have rigged elections to take care of the rest.<br /><br />7) Favor Big Business:<br /><br />Hitler's economic policies were designed to help the largest corporations in Germany, particularly ones where high-ranking Nazi officials were majority shareholders.<br /><br />Bush appeases big business, big industry, big oil and his crony's.  <br /><br />8) Fear + Country - Disloyalty = Blind Faith:<br /><br />"...the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy.  All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger." <br />- Herman Goering to Gustave Gilbert, a German intelligence officer at the Nuremberg trials<br /><br />The Nazis used fear of Jews and Communism and love of country to get Germans to blindly follow Hitler and his actions.<br /> <br />Republicans use fear of terrorism and love of country to get Americans to blindly follow Bush and his actions. <br /><br />The Nazis accused those who dissented as being disloyal.<br />Republicans accuse those who dissent as being disloyal. <br /><br />"To those who scare peace-loving people with phantoms of lost liberty, my message is this: Your tactics only aid terrorists, for they erode our national unity and diminish our resolve."<br />- Attorney General John Ashcroft, Dec. 6, 2001 <br /><br />"Liberals hate America and our troops!"<br />- Brainwashed Republicans, every day<br /><br />9) The Invader:<br /><br />Hitler invaded Europe without provocation or a credible reason, but conned his country into thinking there was.  <br /><br />Bush invaded Iraq without provocation or a credible reason, but conned his country into thinking there was.  <br /><br />Hitler used the "blitzkrieg."<br />Bush used "shock and awe." <br /><br />"Where the German soldier sets foot, he remains."<br />- Hitler<br /><br />"Americans don't 'cut and run.'" <br />- George Bush and the Republicans<br /><br />"I give a propaganda reason for starting the war. Never mind whether it is plausible or not. The victor will not be asked afterward whether he told the truth or not. In starting and waging war, it is not right that matters, but victory."<br />- Hitler <br /><br />10) The Enforcers: <br /><br />The Nazis had the Enabling Act.<br />The Republicans have the Patriot Act. <br /><br />The Nazis had the Gestapo and the "brown shirts."<br />The Republicans have similar versions of the same: the FBI, the CIA (Dec. 2005 insert: the NSA) and Attorney's General John Ashcroft and Alberto Gonzales. <br /><br />The Nazis tortured WWII POW's.<br />"Enemy combatants" and prisoners were/are being tortured at Bagram Air Base, Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay. <br /><br />Hitler had the SS do his dirty work.<br />Bush has the CIA doing his dirty work (by secretly flying foreigners/prisoners to country's that conveniently allow torture).<br /> <br />11) Religion:<br /><br />"But there is something else I believe, and that is that there is a God...And this God again has blessed our efforts during the past 13 years."<br />- Hitler, 1940<br /><br />Contrary to the Republican myth, Hitler was not an atheist.  He was raised a Catholic, believed in the Bible, went to a monastery school and was an alter boy.  Incredibly, he wanted to become a priest.  <br /><br />The Nazis had the Christian-Social movement.<br />The Republicans have the Christian Coalition. <br /><br />In 1933 the Nazis conducted a violent campaign against the "godless movement."<br />Republicans ridicule the "godless" whenever given the opportunity. <br /><br />Hitler attacked Communists for the spread of atheism.<br />Republicans verbally attack atheists, secularists and anyone who believes in the clear separation between "Church and State." <br /><br />Nazis enacted prayer in school. <br />Republicans want prayer in school.<br /><br />"Secular schools can never be tolerated because such schools have no religious instruction, and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air; consequently, all character training and religion must be derived from faith...WE NEED BELIEVING PEOPLE." (caps mine)<br />- Hitler <br /><br />Hitler could not have come into power without the support of the Protestant and Catholic churches and Germany's Christian's.<br /><br />The Republicans and George Bush could not have come into power without the support of the Religious Right. <br /><br />"Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: by defending myself against the Jew, I am fighting for the work of the Lord." <br />- Hitler<br /><br />"God told me to strike at al Qaeda and I struck them, and then he instructed me to strike at Saddam (Hussein), which I did, and now I am determined to solve the problem in the Middle East."<br />- George Bush<br /><br />Conclusion: <br /><br />"If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. The lie can be maintained only for such time as the State can shield the people from the political, economic and/or military consequences of the lie. It thus becomes vitally important for the State to use all of its powers to repress dissent, for the truth is the mortal enemy of the lie, and thus by extension, the truth is the greatest enemy of the State."<br />- Geobbels<br /><br />Again, while it is and should be a knee jerk reaction to severely denounce any comparison between the Nazis and anyone, you have to remember it is a knee jerk reaction. <br /><br />But at worst, if I'm right, Republicans are just like the Nazis - without the camps.  At best, if I'm wrong, the Republican party has become a cult - with power. <br /><br />"Thus inwardly armed with confidence in God and the unshakable stupidity of the voting citizenry, the politicians can begin the fight for the 'remaking' of the Reich as they call it."<br />- Hitler (Mein Kampf)<br /><br />I'm glad I'm a Democrat and can think for myself.  <br /><br /><br />Public Service Announcement: <br /><br />Signs that you're a brainwashed Republican:<br /><br />1. Your views and opinions were/are someone else's.<br />2. You blame "liberals" and/or Clinton for everything. <br />3. You blast, blame and ridicule Hollywood, France, environmentalists, Dan Rather, Michael Moore, the "liberal" media, the UN, and the WTO (other much needed enemy's created by the GOP because it always has to be someone else's fault). <br />4. You despised Bill and Hillary Clinton from the moment he announced his candidacy for President in 1991 and your hatred for both of them has grown exponentially ever since.  <br />5. Bush is not to blame for 9/11 because that was all Clinton's fault (and the 1993 attack on the WTC was also Clinton's fault - not Bush 41's - even though Clinton had only been in office a month).   <br />6. You hate Ted Kennedy but can't name three pieces of legislation that he supported or opposed in his 40+ year Senate career as the reason for such hatred.  Heck, you can't even name ONE (and saying he's "liberal" or that he's for "big government" won't cut it).    <br />7. Antonin Scalia is your favorite Supreme Court Justice - "because he's got such a wonderful mind" - but are unable to describe one legal opinion he wrote.  Heck, you can't even NAME one.  <br />8. You hated John Kerry because he was a "liberal" and a "flip-flopper," but didn't know anything about him until Karl Rove told you he was "liberal" and a "flip-flopper," so you kept ridiculing Kerry as a "liberal" and a "flip-flopper" just like you were told to. <br />9. You automatically take the conservative/Republican side of every issue. <br />10. You only get your news from Fox and/or conservative talk radio. <br />11. You don't believe a negative news story on a Republican because it's either "liberal propaganda" or it came from the "liberal media."<br />12. You regularly spout Republican propaganda: "Democrats tax and spend," "liberal media," "Democrats are soft on (whatever)," "Democrats are going to take my guns away," etc.<br />13. You constantly use the words "lib" or "liberal" as an insult or in derogatory ways. <br />14. You get riled up whenever a Republican publicly blasts "liberals" (just like you're trained to).  <br />15. Since nothing is more important then defending your (indefensible) arguments:<br />A) You're too arrogant and stubborn to admit you're wrong (even on a minor point) and ignore facts that do.<br />B) You lie, distort facts and stand logic on it's head.<br />C) You're willing to show your ignorance and insult your own intelligence by using spin that's laughable (i.e. "We lost 1,000 men some DAYS during WWII!"  Or "We've had troops in Japan and Germany for the last 50 years!")<br />16. When "debating" a "lib," you become belligerent, pugnacious and insulting.<br />17. When "debating" a "lib," you repeat GOP talking points or talk radio rhetoric (practically word for word) because you don't have any reasons or ideas of your own to support your argument. <br />18. When "debating" a "lib," your argument always comes down to Clinton's sex life.  <br />19. You never question George Bush because he's never wrong, never lies and never makes mistakes. <br />20. You never question Dick Cheney, Don Rumsfeld or Condi Rice because they know everything. <br />21. You label every "lib" that opposes the Iraq war as a traitor, anti-American or communist. <br />22. You conveniently overlook blatant Republican hypocrisy, such as: <br /><br />Bush 41 and Dole go to war: good and their service is glorified. <br />Kerry goes to war: bad and his service is ridiculed. <br /><br />And...<br /><br />Clinton avoids Vietnam: he's "a draft dodger" who "hates America." <br />Bush and Cheney avoid Vietnam: they're "great leaders" and "great Americans."<br /> <br />And...<br /><br />Clinton lies under oath in a civil deposition - Impeachment <br />Dan Rather mistakenly uses forged documents in a story about George Bush and later admits the error - "He MUST resign!" <br />Bush lies, exaggerates and uses forged documents to mislead the country into a totally unnecessary war that has turned into such a colossal disaster, that we'll be paying a dear price for it, in a number of ways, for decades to come - "4 more years, 4 more years!"<br />23. The back-to-back Hitler and Bush quotes at the bottom of the "Religion" heading didn't send a chill down your spine. <br />24. You're spinning and making excuse's so you can answer "no" to these questions, i.e. No. 4 - "Hey, I didn't start 'hating' the Clintons until he got the nomination (or took office).  And besides my hatred for them isn't 'exponential'."  No. 8 - "Of course Kerry was a liberal, everyone knew that.  And nobody 'TOLD' me to SAY anything!" (Okay, then just like you were TRAINED to).  No. 9 - "I don't 'automatically' take the conservative/Republican side of 'EVERY' issue.  No. 10 - "No, I also get my news from Joe Scarborough on MSNBC!"  No. 19 - "Sometimes I DO question George Bush...on his trade policy with Cameroon.  And he doesn't preach God and morals enough."  No. 22 - "Hey, George Bush joined the National Guard!"<br />25. You want to respond to this, without considering the possibility that you really might be a brainwashed Republican, by making up comparisons between Hitler and the Democrats or by ridiculing me or calling me a "lib" (a typical belligerent move by a brainwashed Republican who's unable admit the truth).  <br /><br />If more then two of these apply, seek professional help immediately.  I'm serious.
