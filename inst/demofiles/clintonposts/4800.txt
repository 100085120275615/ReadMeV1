<p>The only reason to read Rolling Stone is Matt Taibbi (whose sublime smackdown of <em>The World Is Flat</em> in the New York Press remains the single funniest book review I&#8217;ve ever read in my life.   Alas, the link is dead.)   Actually I still don&#8217;t read Rolling Stone, even for Taibbi:  my bonus subscription issues pile up in the wing chair in the kitchen, the half-naked women on the covers (why oh why oh why) leering at no one but the cat.  But Taibbi&#8217;s recent column on the DLC showed up in the <a href="http://daoureport.salon.com/">Daou Report</a>, so I read it online:  <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/11275627/the_low_post_democrats_walk_themselves_to_the_gallows/1">Democrats walk themselves to the gallows.</a>  </p>

<p>His central thesis, buried appropriately in the center of the article, boils down as follows:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>&#8220;The Democratic Party has been operating for two decades without the active participation of its voters.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;It raised money by appealing directly to companies in private fundraisers, and it used the commercial media to enforce its policy positions, in particular its desire to &#8216;clearly reject our antiwar wing,&#8217; as Al From put it a few years back. It&#8217;s a simple formula for running one-half of American politics; you decide on John Kerry two years before the presidential vote, raise him $200 million bucks, and let CNN and The New York Times take care of any Howard Deans who might happen to pop up in the meantime. The same greased track is being prepared for Hillary Clinton right now, and we can be quite sure that guns are already being aimed at Russell Feingold.&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>&#8220;The unspoken subtext of this increasingly bitter debate between the Democratic Party establishment and the supporters of people like Ned Lamont and Hillary Clinton&#8217;s antiwar challenger, Jonathan Tasini, is a referendum ordinary people have unexpectedly decided to hold on the kingmaker&#8217;s role of the holy trinity of the American political establishment &#8212; big business, the major political parties and the commercial media. &#8220;</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Of course you could argue that the Republican party is also run by power brokers who dictate to their voters, but the difference is that their voters like very much what&#8217;s being dictated.  They totally get off on that godbaggism and racism and xenophobia.   And they definitely get involved &#8212; they worship Bush in church and have meetings in the Christian fellowship hall about how important it is to vote for torturers and war criminals so that Amurka will be protected from the evil brown demons.   </p>

<p>Democratic voters, on the other hand, mostly vote Democrat because it&#8217;s better than voting Republican.   That&#8217;s pretty much the rationale right there.  It&#8217;s not like the party actually stands for anything or the leadership actually reflects anything people care about.  In fact, they ought to just change the name:  instead of the Democratic Party, it should be the Not-Republican Party.  </p>

<p>My question is about what Taibbi refers to as the &#8220;referendum ordinary people have unexpectedly decided to hold.&#8221;  He&#8217;s talking about bloggers &#8212; hey, I&#8217;m a blogger! &#8212; and other grassroots movements, though I&#8217;ve noticed that there&#8217;s a disturbing Invasion of the Body Snatchers effect at work.  One excessively popular Democratic blogger (and you know who I mean) has been entirely co-opted by a pod from the DLC, and my emails from Move On are increasingly indistinguishable from the emails I get from Howard Dean, who used to be a rebel but is now&#8230;the Chairman of the Democratic National Committee.   One of these days I&#8217;m going to open my email and see Donald Sutherland&#8217;s face with his mouth open in a huge scream. </p>
