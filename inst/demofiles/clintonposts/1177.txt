Kerry said Wednesday that he also would support the Democratic nominee."</blockquote></font>Personally, I like Senator Lieberman. But Mr. Lieberman has made himself too cozy with this Administration. <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/442/423/1600/liebermanbushembrace.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/442/423/320/liebermanbushembrace.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />If he should fail to win the Democratic Primary it is incumbent upon him to announce his support for the Democrat that wins just as he would expect Mr. Lamont to support his candidacy if he should be successful instead.<br /><br />Thank you Senators Clinton and Kerry!<br /><br />We have a mighty struggle ahead of us in our goal to retake the Senate from the Republicans.  Whatever we may think of Senator Lieberman, it will not be helpful for reform and change to occur for any of us to undermine our common values and goals.<br /><br />America needs change more than ever!<br /><br />We got your back John!  Keep on coming.<br /><br />Bob
