<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font>President Bushâs use of the Marine Corp Individual Ready Reservists could not have been pleasant news for the many U.S. Marines that found out they are about to leave for up to 18 months to fight (and possibly die) in Iraq.<span>Â  </span>The fact that the war is going so dreadfully wrong, and the mission so woefully off track, makes many feel sorry these Marines now must plan to pack up and take residence in (most likely) the Baghdad theater of the war.<span>Â  </span>While I disagree with the war and the policies that flow from it, I would be remiss if not noting that these soldiers volunteered to join the United States military and receive the paychecks and perks that come along with national service.<span>Â  </span></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">President Bushâs decision comes at the same time that the Defense Department continues not to be able to attract the needed volunteers to do battle in Afghanistan and Iraq.<span>Â  </span>There was a shortfall, according to the military, of about 1,200 people.<span>Â  </span>What I found interesting however was (after a bit a searching today online) that since 1983 there have been 953 men and women expelled from the U.S. Marines under the idiotic policy of<span>Â  </span>âDonât Ask. Donât Tellâ which is targeted at removing gay men and women from the military.<span>Â  </span>Furthermore data shows that two gay, lesbian, or bi-sexual service members daily in 2005 were issued their discharge papers from the military for simply being whom God made them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><font>It is alarming so many skilled men and women who have been trained at taxpayerâs expense to serve their nation in time of turmoil have been removed from the military over their sexual identification.<span>Â  </span>According to the 2000 U.S. Census data over 65,000 military personnel describe themselves as gay.<span>Â  </span>Their service is jeopardized by the insane notion of somehow equating ones sexuality with the ability to well serve this nation in the military.<span>Â  </span>Conservative Senator Barry Goldwater once said that he did not care if people in the military were straight, only that they could shoot straight.<span>Â  </span></font></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">At a time when the world hot spots are growing hotter and more numerous it makes no sense to this blogger to discriminate over the issues of sexuality.<span>Â Â  </span>The shortage in officers is quite serious as the military reports they are short 2,500 captains and majors this year alone.<span>Â Â  </span>In an effort to attract more citizens into the military the requirement on age, education, and even criminal records have been relaxed to fill the roles.<span>Â  </span>Sadly, however, the military canât find the way to get past the redneck mentality of not allowing gay and lesbian women to serve openly for their country.</font></p>
<p><font size="3">Israel does not bar gay men and women from the military and are âGodâs chosen peopleâ who have one hell-of-a military machine to use in the Middle East.<span>Â  </span>President Harry Truman decided that black Americans should be able to serve in the military and the bubbas of America had to suck it in, shut up, and accept it.<span>Â  </span>Colin Powell is but one fine example of what the end result of that policy has allowed for this nation. President Clinton dropped the ball by not ending this shame by putting forth an Executive Order and removing the issue from debate.<span>Â  </span>He would have taken some political pounding at first but soon the nation would have tired and moved onto another topic.</font></p>
<p><span>It is estimated that over 40,000 gay Americans would join the military today if the flawed policy were over-turned by Congress.<span>Â  </span>Critical shortages of certain types of engineers and linguists demand adjustment of a policy that was designed for the narrow-minded enlisted man in the military.<span>Â  </span>If is time to stop pandering to the lowest common denominatorâs in the military (which I admit are many) and change a policy to better reflect our needs in America to defend from the threats we face aboard.</span>
