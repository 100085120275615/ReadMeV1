Kennedy Jr.</strong>, as it appeared in the business section of the Jan. 29 <em>New York Times</em>. Could this be RFK Jr.'s true calling?</p>

<p>"THAT KENNEDY STYLE - Soon, <strong>Robert Kennedy Jr.</strong>, lawyer and environmental activist, will have a new job on his rÃ©sumÃ©: fashion model. In late February, Gant, the sportswear maker, will roll out an $8.5 million campaign featuring photographs of Mr. Kennedy, 52, his wife, Mary, and four of their six children, all doing active things that Kennedys tend to do. <br />"Gant's goal is to align the East Coast roots of the preppy brand, founded in New Haven in 1949, with Mr. Kennedy's all-American, seafaring image. His environmental organization, the Waterkeeper Alliance, received a 'six-figure donation' from Gant, Mr. Kennedy said. And at more than 200 Gant stores worldwide, Gant is offering polo shirts, sweatshirts and caps with the Waterkeeper Alliance logo (all proceeds go to the group). <br />For a photo shoot in August, the Kennedy clan, in full Gant garb, pursued Kennedy-style leisure at Menemsha Harbor on Martha's Vineyard. <br />"It's an enclave for the commercial fishery," Mr. Kennedy said. "Waterkeeper is strongly supported by commercial and recreational fishermen, so it's part of our tradition." <br />But don't count on Mr. Kennedy to start a sartorial revolution the way his uncle, the president, did, inspiring millions of men to go hatless. <br />"I wear jeans and khakis," Mr. Kennedy said. "And thin ties."<br />Why thin ties?<br />"I just like thin ties." <br />And why team with Gant? "They've been a longtime supporter of Waterkeeper," said Mr. Kennedy, a lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council â not to mention a master falconer and an accomplished whitewater paddler. "They have a strong corporate ethic about protecting the planet." <br />Still, the new move is highly unusual. "It's the first time in my memory that anyone in the political arena has allied himself with any brand in the fashion arena," said <strong>Marylou Luther</strong>, editor of the <em>International Fashion Syndicate</em>. "What's next: Hillary and headbands?" (as written by <strong>Francine Parnes</strong>; photo credit, Gant) </p></div>
