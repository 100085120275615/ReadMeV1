<div>This is what I got up to yesterday, having heaps of fun making this guy. If you don't know already he is from the <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/">wee wonderfuls put together book 1</a> which is available through Hillary Lang's online <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/">shop</a>. He is a present for a new baby born just under 2 weeks ago to a colleague at work. As the recipient is a boy, I really wanted to make a boy bear. Which meant a little alteration to the pattern to give him a pair of pants rather than a dress like the pattern booklet. Apart from that I had no preconceived idea on what he was going to look like. I knew I was going to use the brown wool and herringbone fabric for the pants and the rest just evolved from there. I really love the tie (thanks kristen, the ribbon was tied around the fabric I got from you) and the belt even thought they aren't exactly baby/toddler proof. To personalise him I embroidered the bubs initials on the back.<br />
<br />and the name, well I can thank Abbey for that. She obviously thinks he resembles the red <a href="http://tuttifruiti.blogspot.com/www.the">wiggle</a>.<br />
