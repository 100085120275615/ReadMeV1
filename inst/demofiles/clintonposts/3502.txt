<div>Robert Scheer's column in liberal journal The Nation - carried a few weeks ago by CBS News - spells out the anti-war arguments for choosing someone other than Hillary Clinton to carry the Democratic standard in 2008.<br />
<br />Scheer's view is that, by failing to disavow her support for the invasion of Iraq, Hillary cannot claim to offer "progressive leadership for the nation."  He calls on Democrats to acknowledge this argument by choosing someone else to represent them as their presidential candidate.<br />
<br />Just about anyone else will do.  "It is unconscionable that those who can accurately measure the true cost of the Iraq folly in wasted lives and resources ... dare prefer her to potential 2008 presidential election rivals John Kerry, Al Gore, Russ Feingold and John Edwards, who have all come to speak honestly of this quagmire and our need to extricate ourselves from it," Scheer writes.  Even names that are not usually talked about as likely presidential contenders would be better than Hillary, says Scheer.  "Why not draft Barbara Boxer?" he suggests to those whose primary goal is "to support an inspiring female candidate to break America's ultimate glass ceiling."<br />
<br />Scheer attacks Hillary for adopting the same strategic approach as the Bush administration, namely to keep applying pressure on the Iraqi government to take on more of its own security burden.  Scheer thinks that this misunderstands the complexity of Iraq's situation.  "The occupation by the U.S. military of a troubled Muslim nation cobbled together by European colonialists and ruled for decades by a tyrant has unleashed religious and nationalist impulses, increased the popular appeal of extremist and terror groups and destabilized the region," Scheer says.  The longer the US occupation continues, he argues, the worse it will get. <br />
<br />With Democrats lining up against her to be the voice of the party's anti-war sentiment, it remains to be seen how much of misjudgement, politically speaking, Hillary may have made in sticking to her guns (no pun intended) on Iraq.  Her main strategy for 2008 to date has been based on the assumption that her biggest obstacle was perceptions of her electability.  Now that she faces another challenge - this time from the left, where she must reasonably have thought to have been secure a year ago - is her unassailability as the Democratic front-runner now in doubt?  We may get some clues to this from opinion polls next year as national campaigning begins in earnest and her advantage in terms of name recognition starts to dissipate.  But we won't get a definitive answer until Iowa in January 2008.<br />
