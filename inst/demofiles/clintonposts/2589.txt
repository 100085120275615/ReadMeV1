<div><p>11:30 in the evening in a hotel in - I can't remember where I am...but it's the town right smack in the middle of that ol' Hadrians Wall.</p>

<p>I have no time.&nbsp; I think I overestimated how much free time I'd have to sit around and blog about my travels.&nbsp; Blogging was much easier when I had a full time job.&nbsp; HA!</p>

<p>Thinking of shutting down.&nbsp; I don't know how I can maintain this, really.&nbsp; Perhaps I can coerce Hillary to give me a 'column' over there at I'm With Socrates...and I can throw you all a bone from time to time.&nbsp; </p>

<p>In summary and one word of description/opinion:&nbsp; Dublin (boo) - Kells (ok) - Westport (very cool) - Achill Island (beautiful)- Galway (aight) - Leenaun (friggin brilliant!) - Cliffs of Moher (very cool indeed) - Doolin (A+) - back to Dublin and on to a Ferry over to England.</p>

<p>Next Scotland:&nbsp; We went thru Glasgow - Fort William - Inverness (Zack swares he saw Nessy)- Somewhere just south of Ullapool - where we are now.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Some random thoughts to leave you with.&nbsp; Rainy.&nbsp; Green.&nbsp; Moist.&nbsp; Boggy.&nbsp; Balmy.&nbsp; The UK doesn't know about salad dressing - and certainly not RANCH -, nor are they familiar with the ever popular ICE WATER.&nbsp; When I do ask for water, I get a Dixie Cup sized glass and no ice.&nbsp; There are hairy cows in the Highlands and they are the coolest thing.&nbsp; No ranch, did I already mention that??&nbsp; All the soda tastes DIET.&nbsp; They play more American music here in the UK than in the states.&nbsp; Words like Interstate, Cell, and Rent don't get you very far in these parts.&nbsp; If I have one more Irish, Scottish, or English breakfast...(which is all the same thing...a fried egg, toast, sausage, ham and a 'toe-ma-toe'), I may never have any of the forementioned again in my life.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; There are road signs all over the place that say 'Tiredness Kills'.&nbsp; I want to put up a sign next to all of them that reads 'Round-a-bouts Kill'.&nbsp; The POUND...is SOOOOOO hard on our dollar.&nbsp; In fact, the whole of UK is insanely expensive!!!&nbsp; We are heading to Hillary's tomorrow, thank god.&nbsp; Couch surfing, TELLY (awww yeah),&nbsp; Internet,&nbsp; LAUNDRY, and RANCH DRESSING baby!&nbsp; </p>

<p>I found a tick with its bum sticking out, and head burrowed, in my thigh while taking a shower this evening.&nbsp; Lovely eh?&nbsp; I've also already managed to lose (err, accidentally leave behind in various places) my travel pillow and my Marmot precip jacket.&nbsp; ROCK ON!</p>

<p>Cheers from Stells in the Outback!&nbsp; Er.&nbsp; Great Britian.</p></div>
