<div><p>I hate to admit this, but I watch the <em>Today</em> show in the morning, even more so now that the giggly idiot will be sitting in Walter Cronkite's old chair.&nbsp; On the show, Al Roker did a segment mimicking the dating game using some People Magazine's designees as the &quot;sexiest Bachelors.&quot;&nbsp; To my stunning disbelief, Ace was contestant number three. The two others seemed liked hapless fools I've never heard of before.&nbsp; The young Bachelorette, a Manhattanite, asked directed questions like what musical instrument you wanted to be, and what song and poem you like best.&nbsp; Of course, the two others were no match for Scarchest who said he liked the song <em>Butterflies </em>by Michael Jackson and then broke into that disturbing and horrifying falsetto.</p>

<p>As you recall, that was one of Ace's more dreadful performances from Season Five, which left me retching and flummoxed.&nbsp; The young single chose Ace as her date and it made it all clear to me why there are so many women out there who can't find a husband.&nbsp; They have terrible judgment and seem to only want to date gay men, who want to have sex with them occasionally.&nbsp; I hope they have fun together and I'm sure Ace will plan to see a Chick flick, pedicures, smoothies and a shopping binge.&nbsp; But as for marriage, she would be better served by going after one of those eligible Bachelors from the Kennedy family or perhaps, Alec Baldwin, now that he's single.</p>

<p>Once good old Patrick clears up his drug problem, he would make a fine husband.&nbsp; If he is anything like his father, this women may end up having the same life as Joan Kennedy.&nbsp; Indeed, Patrick, like the black man he wants to be treated like, pleaded guilty yesterday for DUI, while being let off on a reckless driving charge and failure to display a driving permit in a plea agreement worked out by his high-priced lawyer.&nbsp; It just goes to show how sincere the Left are when they ask to be treated like everyone else.&nbsp; If Patrick truly was an African-American in this incident, he might have ended up with some illiterate public defender who graduated even lower in his law school class than Senator Joseph Biden.&nbsp; Beyond that, he might have never even made it into the courtroom since he would have been riddled with bullets by some overzealous police officer.</p>

<p>As for Alec Baldwin, his high-priced mouthpiece was not as effective since he was ordered to see a psychologist yesterday by the judge presiding over his custody battle with Kim Basinger.&nbsp; If I was that shrink, I would wear body armor when evaluating Alec.&nbsp; He does have a tendency to overreact on occasions in a somewhat violent and unstable manner as indicated in his recent debacle on Broadway where his co-star quit the show as a result of his tempestuous antics.&nbsp; As for a treatment plan, I would recommend an overdose of shock therapy.</p>

<p>Another Hollywood has-been who might want to consider psychiatric assistance is Daryl Hannah.&nbsp; She was removed from a tree in an L.A. Park yesterday, protesting a new development.&nbsp; I guess if your last claim to fame was appearing in <em>Splash</em> and getting dumped by the dearly departed JFK, Jr., the best thing you can do to grab attention is waste L.A. Police officer's time procuring you from a tree.</p>

<p>Not to be outdone by all this, John Kerry appeared before a group of &quot;progressives&quot; in Washington, DC yesterday.&nbsp; He announced that politicians can't have it both ways when it comes to the Iraq War. Please stop laughing!&nbsp; To the man who voted for the war before voting against it before voting for it after not voting, this is a sorry example of a total lack of self-awareness.&nbsp; But even more laughable, was our former First Lady who declared to the same group that the issue of abortion should be approached with moderation.&nbsp; This is the same women who voted against banning a procedure where a fully developed fetus has a needle stuck in its head, its skull crushed and its brain sucked out all in the name of &quot;choice.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't care where you stand on abortion, but that hardly sounds like moderation to me when you support partial-birth abortions. </p>

<p>But what else should we expect from some of the worst pathological liars in American History who are still under the delusion that the dark era in the 90's was a spectacular success.&nbsp; In her recent book, Ann Coulter nicely summarizes some of Clinton's accomplishments:&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; a failed attempt at socialized medicine; 2) a phony Internet bubble; 3) spurning Sudan's attempt to capture Osama Bin Laden; 4) selling burial plots at Arlington Cemetery to campaign contributors; 5) sex romps in the Oval Office; 6) raping Juanita Broderick; 7) obstruction of justice; 8) a suspended law license; and 9) pardoning sleazy crooks on the way out of office in exchange for campaign contributions.</p>

<p>There were a few other things Ann forget to mention like rifling through FBI files of political opponents, sicking the IRS on enemies like the Heritage Foundation, Travelgate, the slaughter at Waco, repeated failures to respond to the first attacks on the World Trade Center, embassy bombings in Africa and the U.S.S. Cole, stealing furniture from the White House and vandalizing the Old Executive Office Building after Mr. Inconvenient Truth LOST the election.</p>

<p>Ann is such a liar and this just shows how mean she is that she failed to mention all the successes of the Clinton years.&nbsp; I should sue her like the 9-11 windows from New Jersey are promising to do.&nbsp; After all, how dare she accuse them of trying to profit off their husband's deaths when they are trying to make money off Ann through a frivolous lawsuit, probably spearheaded by everybody's favorite ambulance chaser John Edwards.</p>

<p>I hope you all tune in to the Tonight Show and watch Ann spar with George Carlin.&nbsp; I can't wait to hear what he has to say of any sense that could dispute the fact that suffering a tragedy does not entitle you to dictate how a prime parcel of Manhattan real estate should be used; it does not entitle you to millions of dollars from the government through that pork spending others like to call the 9-11 fund; or run around the country calling the leader of the free world &quot;Hitler&quot;, a &quot;bastard&quot; and a &quot;terrorist&quot; (i.e, Cindy Sheehan).&nbsp; &nbsp;Oops.&nbsp; I can't believe I said this.&nbsp; How dare I attack these poor victims who have been manipulated and exploited for political purposes by the Left!&nbsp; Well, if you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>Maniac - - out</p>
