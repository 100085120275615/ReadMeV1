<p>If we get enough donors for an extra set of &#8220;<a href="http://www.4condi.com/wordpress/2006/07/30/a-pair-of-brass-ones-and-its-not-his-elbows/" target="_blank">brass ones</a>&#8221; like we&#8217;re getting for Democratic Governor Bill Richardson, maybe we should send them to Chuck.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a modest proposal, let&#8217;s establish an <em>ad hoc</em> committee to award him, along with other deserving recipients in the future, the <strong>Jim Jeffords Memorial Brass <em>Cojones</em> Award</strong>. (OK, Jim&#8217;s not dead yet, but his political career <em><strong>is</strong></em> after he got into bed &#8212; in a non-Clintonesque, political kind of way &#8212; with <a title="Lost to Jim Thune (R-SD) in 2002" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Daschle" target="_blank">Tom Daschle</a> only 5 days after voting for President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts on May 26, 2001.). In return for his becoming a so-called &#8220;independent&#8221; and giving control of the Senate to the Democrats, 50-49-1, during the first half of the Bush administration; he was responsible for stalling much of the Republican agenda. Although it is small consolation, <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Daschle" href="http://" target="_blank">Tom Daschle</a> and the Democrats lost their grip on the Senate in the 2002 midterm elections when Tom himself got the electoral &#8220;pink slip&#8221; from the voters. Jim abandoned the Republican Party after 35 years, and in less than 2 years lost his chairmanship &#8212; the &#8220;bait&#8221; for his party switch in the first place.</p>
<p>Now, after announcing his plans to retire and not seek re-election in 2006; Jim&#8217;s got one last &#8220;parting shot&#8221; for the rest of the country. Although he hasn&#8217;t endorsed him yet, and may not ever, Jim is leaving his Senate seat open for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a>, self-described &#8220;democratic socialist,&#8221; but ostensibly an &#8220;independent.&#8221; <strong><a href="http://voteparke.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Greg Parke</strong></a>,</strong> a Vermont Condi admirerer, retired Air Force officer (Although, he looks young enough to be recruit!), is a Vermont Republican hoping to help Bernie find out about the joys of political unemployment this November. (<a title="http://voteparke.com/" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders" target="_blank">link</a>)</p>
<p>Are there any other nominees for the this &#8220;award? or volunteers for the committee?
