Q Thank you, Mr. President. Yesterday while you were gone, Senator Kerry, who was your challenger in the last election --<br /><br />THE PRESIDENT: I remember that.<br /><br />Q You remember that. (Laughter.) He said he now regrets his votes on the war. And, actually, I think Senator Clinton at the same meeting, actually heard some boos when she said that she did not support a timetable for withdrawal. Do you see, as some of your critics do, a parallel between what's going on in Iraq now and Vietnam?<br /><br />THE PRESIDENT: No.<br /><br />Q Why?<br /><br />THE PRESIDENT: Because there's a duly-elected government; 12 million people voted. They said, we want something different from tyranny, we want to live in a free society. And not only did they vote for a government, they voted for a constitution. Obviously, there is sectarian violence, but this is, in many ways, religious in nature, and I don't see the parallels.<br /><br />You know, look -- I thought you were going to ask, do I regret what I did. Absolutely not. I made the right decision in Iraq. It's the right thing to get rid of Saddam Hussein. And now it's the right thing to stand with this government when they build a new democracy. And I reminded the Iraqi people, their democracy doesn't have to look like us. It's their country, and the government ought to reflect their traditions and their history. All we expect is people to be treated with respect and there to be self-governance in a way that tolerates differences of opinion.<br /><br /><p><span><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/white+house+press+corps" rel="tag">White House Press Corps</a> | <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/press+Briefing" rel="tag">Press Briefing</a> | <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/dana+perino" rel="tag">Dana Perino</a> | <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/news+media" rel="tag">News Media</a> | <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/bush+administration" rel="tag">Bush Administration</a>  | <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/iraq" rel="tag">Iraq</a>  </span>
