<em>By Staff Sergeant Wynn S. Allen, Retired, Westport, Connecticut, in a letter to the editor of </em>The Connecticut Post<em>, printed Feb. 20, 2006</em><blockquote>After this past week Americans should really take a hard look at the major news media outlets. Their actions were that of a spoiled, whining brat.<br /><br />They couldn't handle the fact that a local Corpus Christi newspaper (an <em>Associated Press</em> affiliate) had beat them in reporting the vice president's hunting accident. They were demanding to know why they were not informed right away. Then they started speculating about Harry Whittington's death, not because they have compassion for the man, but because they so badly wanted to get rid of Vice President Dick Cheney.<br /><br />The liberals also took this opportunity to attack the Bush administration. Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and Hillary Clinton, D-NY, immediately went on the offensive. What should be noted is that these are the last people to be commenting on the failure to report things in a timely manner. The news media did not go after Reid when he waited three days to report his stroke or when he attacked the Republicans over the Abramoff scandal and yet failed to report that he collected about $68,000 in donations from Abramoff's firm.<br /><br />The media has never attacked Kennedy who waited more than eight hours to report his car accident that killed Mary Jo Kopechne (she was trapped in Kennedy's car for approximately two hours before drowning).<br /><br />Then there are the Clintons -- the news media has given them numerous passes. Look at Travelgate, their use of FBI files on their political opponents, the blocking of <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/tribune-review/opinion/columnists/datelinedc/print_417927.html">the Barrett</a> Report <a href="http://barrett.oic.gov/">(the [Clinton HUD Secertary's] IRS scandal)</a>, their illegal collection of Chinese campaign contributions, the mysterious death of Vince Foster and their refusal to allow law enforcement officials into Foster's office prior to their sterilization of his records <em>[not to mention the <a href="http://www.aim.org/publications/media_monitor/2001/12/11.html">mysterious death of Clinton associate and Secretary of Commerce Ron Brown</a>]</em>; and finally, the stealing of national security documents by Clinton national security adviser Sandy Berger prior to the 9-11 commission.<br /><br />The news media has two standards: a very high standard for the Republicans and a nonexistent standard for Democrats.<br /><br />There is no integrity in the news media any longer. Time after time, they have been caught lying to the American people. The real kicker is when they leak sensitive CIA information and say it is in the public interest and they go after "Scooter Libby" for supposedly outing a CIA officer (not a CIA operative).<br /><br />Furthermore, the news media has on numerous occasions reported that there were no WMDs, basically calling President Bush a liar.<br /><br />But recently, Saddam Hussein's top adviser, General Georges Sada, did <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/26514">confirm that Iraq had WMDs before the war and that they were moved to Syria</a> [1] and, on top of that, there are the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/02/18/hussein.tapes/">recordings of Saddam talking about his WMDs</a> and terrorist attacks on the U.S. <em>[see Note 2 for "softening" distortions made by ABC in its reporting on these tapes]</em><br /><br />Where are the major news media outlets on this major issue? Maybe they are too busy going after Cheney, or could it be that if they report this information they will shoot down one of their major liberal arguments against the president?<br /><br />The major news media outlets have become just like the tabloids -- they are entertaining but not always believable!</blockquote>[1] Also: "Israel's top general during Operation Iraqi Freedom, Moshe Yaalon, told the Sun that Saddam 'transferred the chemical agents from Iraq to Syria.'"<br />[2] <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/2/17/125334.shtml?s=ic">"Saddam Translator: ABC Reinterpreted Tapes</a>; <em>"'What Saddam actually said was much more sinister.'"</em><blockquote>The FBI translator who supplied the 12 hours of Saddam Hussein audiotapes excerpted by ABC's "Nightline" Wednesday night now says the network discarded his translations and went with a less threatening version of the Iraqi dictator's comments.<br /><br /><em>"What you heard on ABC News was their translation," </em>former U.N. weapons inspector Bill Tierney told ABC Radio's Sean Hannity on Thursday.<br /><br /><em>"They came up with something different on a key element regarding terrorism in the United States,"</em> Tierney insisted.<br /><br />In the "Nightline" version of the 1996 recording, Saddam predicts that Washington, D.C., would be hit by terrorists. But he adds that Iraq would have nothing to do with the attack.<br /><br />Tierney says, however, that what Saddam actually said was much more sinister. <strong><em>"He was discussing his intent to use chemical weapons against the United States and use proxies so it could not be traced back to Iraq,</em></strong>" he told Hannity.<br /><br />In a passage not used by "Nightline," Tierney says Saddam declares: <em><strong>"Terrorism is coming. ... In the future there will be terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. What if we consider this technique, with smuggling?"</strong></em><br /><br />Tierney's full translations are set for release this weekend by The Intelligence Group in Washington, D.C.</blockquote>I don't support the Republicans or even President Bush in all things, and sincerely would have preferred we not go to war in Iraq unless they had accomplished what they said in those tapes and quotes they planned to do. I don't wish for Americans to die in attacks on our soil or anywhere, but I'm really not in favor of pre-emptive strikes. Now that we're there, though we'd be guilty ourselves of genocide of the Iraqis if we withdraw prematurely and leave them to the wolves.<br /><br />For my part, I think my next car will be a hybrid or ethanol-guzzler and I might just convert my home to wood pellet heating or something.<br /><br />Imagine if we <strong>all </strong>did those things?<br /><br />All that said, my point in posting this is, once again, emphatically, solely to highlight the lies and withholding of true facts by the news media along partisan lines. Yellow journalism is alive, well, and holding court in the U.S. today.
