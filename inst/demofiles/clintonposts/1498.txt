Yes, it remains the predominant US source for what is cleverly called "news." And yeah, the bots who write for it have tremendous access to all levels of political and cultural life. This is understood. But when I read the Gray Lady these days, I sense fear in her pages -- fear that the Times may not have the clout it once had. Fear that it is perpetually behind the curve. Fear of domestic Phalangists who seem to honestly believe that the Times is synonymous with "treason" (whatever that is). And of course, like most major corporate outlets, there is the fear of The People, in most cases bloggers, those of us who can analyze domestic and world events without having it explained to us by and filtered through the traditional mouthpieces. <br /><br />This latter feature was seen in yesterday's edition, in a piece by the New Republic's Ryan Lizza about the demystifying power of YouTube (no point in linking to it, as it falls behind a pay wall within days). Seems that politicos and those who advise /steer them are worried that any "off the cuff" remark made on the stump might immediately haunt whoever said it, linked to countless sites, seen by millions and perhaps millions more should mainstream outlets amplify it. As Howard Wolfson, Hillary Clinton's chattering teeth, told the Times, âIt is a continuation of a trend in which politicians have to assume they are on live TV all the time. You canât get away with making an offensive or dumb remark and assume it wonât get out.â <br /><br />Matthew Dowd, a former Bush insider, added, âPoliticians canât experiment with messages. They canât get voter response. Seventy or 80 years ago, a politician could go give a speech in Des Moines and road-test some ideas and then refine it and then test it again in Milwaukee . . Whatâs happened is that politicians now have to be perfect from Day 1. Itâs taken some richness out of the political discourse.â<br /><br />In other words, YouTube has disrupted the traditional formation and development of political lying, pandering, and obfuscation, and this forces candidates to - gasp! - actually deal in direct modes of communication, which the vast majority cannot and will not do. To a political elite like Dowd, this is something to mourn, which should make the rest of us very happy. <br /><br />As Gore Vidal once observed, American politics is reserved for energetic mediocrities, of which we have a limitless supply. But now we also have the means to trip them up from time to time, assuming that showing mediocrities being energetically mediocre has any lasting effect on the larger mass. <br /><br />I'm not sure how much real power YouTube or any related video site truly has. But like the Web that made it possible, YouTube helps chip away at corporate political and media gates, which makes the gatekeepers nervous, angry and insecure, though a few, like Wolfson, try to play both sides of the gate: <br /><br />âIt does create more accountability and more democratization of information in the process.â <br /><br />Well, yes and no. I'm afraid that those who are afraid of us will find fresher methods of propaganda. Also, an obscene statement can be considered perfectly benign, depending on the topic. When Senator George Allen called college student S.R. Sidarth a âmacaca," Allen was forced to apologize, since Sidarth had captured the slur on tape. But when Hillary Clinton called for the mass murder of Lebanese at a public rally in New York, which was caught by many cameras, no apology was deemed necessary, since slaughtering Arabs is politically acceptable in the US. Of course, Hillary soft-peddled her war cry by saying she "supported" Israel's aggression, but support for that enterprise from a top American Senator is a direct endorsement of flattening buildings and shredding civilians. So YouTube and the Web can do only so much, given where we are at this point in time. Making attitudes like Hillary's shameful in the public eye will require a form of political activism and education that employs the Web, but doesn't solely rely on it to effect the changes that are vitally necessary. <br /><br /><strong>FLASH! </strong>In today's Times, there's a story about how more and more Americans want to be celebrities, no matter how fleeting or embarrassing. Thank you, Gray Lady! I don't know how we'd get along without you.<br /><br /><strong>AND!</strong> What domestic Phalangists <a href="http://rightwingnytimes.cf.huffingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">see when they read the Times</a>.
