<span>Hilary Clinton, Jack Murtha, and Ray Nagin, taken collectively, had quite a week. This is <a href="http://thespisjournal.blogspot.com/2006/01/jerry-springer-al-gore-ray-nagin.html">not the first time that they have been cited</a> as singing their song of gauche harmony within a few days of each other. Itâs almost as if the New York Times kicked off another story for the cast of Hilary, Jack, and Ray to sound off in a discordant unison. Hilary was responsible for the round off back tuck that brought the verbal gymnastics to a conclusion on Friday.  </span>  <span>Attempting to pull off the mother of all political triangulations, Hilary had a rendezvous with Ned Lamont to stage-manage and scheme for his campaign against Joe Lieberman. Never mind that Bill Clinton campaigned vigorously for Lieberman in the primary or that Hilary endorsed old Joe just a few weeks ago. The leftist, socialist wing of her party has surrounded her like the winged monkeys of Oz to demand her loyalty to their patron saint, Ned, as he attempts to unseat the evil Joe. Leave it to Hilary to fly in on her broom and attempt to save the day. The monkeysâ will no doubt protect her as they fly rapidly, in a vulture like formation, to protect her against all the elements of Oz, or in this case, The Times, The Post, and The Daily Kos. </span> <blockquote>
<a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/hills_heavy_hauling_to_aid_lefty_lamont_nationalnews_ian_bishop_and_maggie_haberman.htm">
<br />From the New York Post</a>: August 26, 2006 -- WASHINGTON - <span>Sen. Hillary</span> <span>Rodham Clinton yesterday jumped off the sidelines to throw the full weight of her monstrous political machine behind anti-war Democratic darling Ned Lamont - a move aimed at appeasing her liberal critics. </span> <span>To help Lamont thwart an independent general election challenge from Connecticut Sen. Joe Lieberman, Clinton is loaning Lamont her trusted political spinmeister Howard Wolfson and vowing to help the political novice raise gobs of campaign cash. </span> <span>The relationship is mutually beneficial: While Lamont gets access to Clinton's campaign experts and fund-raisers; she can reap some of the liberal love being heaped on Lamont by party activists and bloggers.</span> <span>She revealed the stunning scope of her support over coffee during an hour-long meeting with Lamont, his wife Annie and his campaign manager Tom Swan at her Chappaqua home yesterday morning.</span>
</blockquote> <span>And, <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/25/114910/549">the Daily Kos</a> loved it! In well over 300 comments, readers of the Daily Kos express their obvious glee at the meeting of Elphaba and Fiyero. (If lost, see the <a href="http://www.wickedthemusical.com/">Wicked homepage</a>). In the meantime, The Times, The Post, and The Daily Kos are cheering Hilary on in her latest display of unadulterated duplicity. These media outlets hold only conservatives accountable. </span>  <span>
<br />
<br />Jack Murtha had his moment in Oz this week too. Murtha continues to blame America for the rise of terrorism in the world, and therefore espouses the appeasement strategy of Europe by default. </span>  <blockquote>
<span>Poor Jack Murtha, he's tried everything, and he obviously can't help it. He will say anything to get back to the front and center of the mainstream media circus. He seems to know precisely what to say to return his name and picture to the front pages of the mainstream media.</span> <span>"Instead of deterring terrorism, our policies are fostering it," Murtha said. "We're spending $8 billion a month on this war, our courageous fighting men and women are being killed and maimed and we are wreaking havoc on Iraq. An end must be brought to this now.â</span> <span>Murtha truly believes that America has created the terrorism. His logic surely applies to pre-9.11 policy as well. Therefore, Murtha blames America for 9.11 and the entire scope of worldwide terrorism. What a fool!  It looks like Murtha has the early lead for idiot of the week. </span>
</blockquote>  <span>To continue with the Wicked theme, Murtha seems to see himself as the great Wizard himself, behind the curtain, pulling the strings and pushing the buttons. Too bad Murtha already overplayed his hand, and pulled his own curtain away as he exposed his true motive: to run for majority leader when Nancy Pelosi ascends to Speaker. Murthaâs fifteen minutes of fame has probably just entered its final Act.<br />
<br />
</span>
<span>With Hilary as Elphaba, Lamont as Fiyero, and Murtha as the Wizard, Nagin completes our cast today in the role of Madame Morrible. An aging magician, trying to instruct others in the craft, Morrible often gets her foot in her mouth. The comparison to Nagin is obvious. His colorful comments are approaching the status of legendary, and if we didnât know they were true, Naginâs comments would seem like something straight from the Myth of Oz.<br />
<br />
</span>
<span>With the onslaught of Katrina anniversary stories just about to begin there is just another irresponsible statement from Ray Nagin:</span>  <span>New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin criticized efforts to develop the empty World Trade Center site when confronted in a television interview about delays in rebuilding his city after Hurricane Katrina. During the CBS "60 minutes" interview, a correspondent pointed out flood-damaged cars still on the streets of New Orleans' devastated Ninth Ward. Nagin replied, "You guys in New York can't get a hole in the ground fixed, and it's five years later. So let's be fair," according to CBS.</span>

</span>
<span>: New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin refused to apologize for taking a cheap shot at the sluggish rebuilding of Ground Zero - but Mayor Bloomberg would not hit back.</span> <span>Bloomberg said he was "scrupulously avoiding criticizing anybody" and focused on the efforts New Yorkers made to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina last year.</span> <span>"We sent down police officers, firefighters, correction officers, equipment to New Orleans," Bloomberg said on his weekly radio show.</span> <span>"So I'll let Mayor Nagin worry about [rebuilding] New Orleans and I'll try to do everything I can to help the governor here."</span> <span>Nagin had upset some New York officials by invoking Ground Zero during a tour of New Orleans' still-decimated Ninth Ward in an attempt to deflect criticism about the pace of the cleanup in the Big Easy.</span>  <span>

<span>
<br />Come on Ray, you're slipping. This comment didn't have the humor of your earlier comments like "Chocolate City." This was just mean-spirited and stupid. Maybe you and Kathleen Blanco need another skirmish to bring out your best verbal fireworks. </span>  <span>
<br />
<br />Is it possible in Nagin's twisted mind that the Katrina disaster and a terrorist attack are equivalent events? In what universe does Nagin exist...</span>  <span>
<br />
<br />We have assembled part of our cast for this upcoming production of Wicked. The days ahead, replete with fabricated Katrina plotlines and half truths, will no doubt provide fodder for more trips down that famed yellow brick road of fantasy, fiction, and contrived intrigue.<br />
