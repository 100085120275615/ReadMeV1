	<p>Larry Flynt, always an outspoken Democrat, isn&#8217;t so sure he&#8217;s staying with the party anymore, thanks to recent actions by Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y.</p>
	<p>Flynt reportedly donated $1,000 to Clinton&#8217;s Senate campaign last month, according to third quarter filings by the campaign, but recently found the check had been returned in the mail. </p>
	<p>&#8220;It's unbelievable,&#8221; Flynt said. &#8220;But I'm used to this kind of hypocrisy.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Flynt made major headlines during President Clinton&#8217;s impeachment in 1998 when he put up $1 million for anyone who could pin sexual misconduct on well-known Republicans, a party Flynt saw as far too quick to wag their fingers at President Clinton&#8217;s alleged indiscretions with Monica Lewinsky. </p>
	<p>Flynt&#8217;s cash offer ended up spotlighting the sexual misconduct of Rep. Robert Livingston, a Republican from Louisiana who was to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker of the House of Representatives. </p>
	<p>Livingston was prompted to confess that he had engaged in adulterous affairs, and he resigned the night before Clinton was to be impeached. </p>
	<p>Flynt later reported that President Clinton thanked him directly for his efforts. </p>
	<p>&#8220;The president sent word to me. He was thankful," he told the New York Observer in 2000. </p>
	<p>But now Flynt isn&#8217;t so thankful himself. </p>
	<p>&#8220;I've been a lifelong Democrat,&#8221; he said Friday. &#8220;But I guess I'm going to have to find a third party or maybe some Republicans.&#8221;
