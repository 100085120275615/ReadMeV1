Sen. Hillary Clinton on Friday harshly criticized Supreme Court nominee John Roberts over his failure to lie about his deeply held beliefs.<br /><br />"If one is going to claim to keep 'deeply held beliefs,' the Senator believes they should be kept, well... deep," said George Baker, a spokesman for the junior Senator from New York.  "Sure, these beliefs exist. Sure, they're part of an overall plan to reshape America in her-- I mean, his-- own image.  But they should be reframed, packaged, perhaps even contradicted in a brazen move to the center.  But  never be revealed!"<br /><br />The Senator said the Robert's failure to create a "mainstream, centrist" characterization of himself in the popular imagination was a sign of "deep narcissism and dangerous transparency."<br /><br />She further criticized his judicial decisions, claiming that they were heavy-handed, judgmental and "legalistic."<br /><br />She also noted that Judge Roberts had a peculiar lack of "unexplained deaths" surrounding him.  She hinted at perhaps a sinister explanation, since, in the America she knows and loves, "people you know just start dropping dead all over the place."<br /><br /><!--<div class="photo-container" style="float: left; width: 370px;"><span style="padding-right: 10px; top: -35px;" class="photo-cap"></span></div>--><br /><br /><div class="realstory"><b>Get The Real Story:</b><br />Linked on <a href="http://www.mudvillegazette.com/archives/003212.html">Mudville</a>, <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/11410">OTB</a>.</div>
