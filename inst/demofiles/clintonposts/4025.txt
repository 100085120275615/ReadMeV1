<p>Arkansans want <a class="post" href="http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2006/08/24/news/0824lrpolliraq.txt">  a timetable</a> for withdrawal from Iraq, but <a class="post" href="http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2006/08/25/news/0825lrpollbush.txt">they prefer Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton</a> (D-NY) in a hypothetical head-to-head race against Governor Mike Huckabee (R-AR) for the presidency in 2008, and yet Clinton&#151last we checked&#151is <i>against</i> setting a timetable.  Arkansans also hand Sen. Mark Pryor (D-AR) <a class="post" href="http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2006/08/25/news/0825lrpollsenator.txt">a 58 percent approval rating</a> while handing President Bush <a class="post" href="http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2006/08/25/news/0825lrpollbush.txt">a 36 percent approval rating</a>&#151and yet a review in July showed that among Democratic senators, <a class="post" href="http://nwanews.com/adg/News/160721/">only one other senator supported President Bush <i>more</i> than Pryor</a>.  Another poll shows that a majority of Arkansans want <a class="post" href="http://www.nwaonline.net/articles/2006/08/24/news/0823lrimmigrationpoll.txt">all illegal immigrants deported</a> while <i>at the same time</i> a majority believe illegal immigrants who already have jobs and are otherwise law-abiding should be granted guest worker status and be given the opportunity to pursue citizenship.</p>

<p>Got all that?</p>

<p>We need whiskey.</p>
