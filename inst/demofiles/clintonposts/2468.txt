<strong>Is there anything lamer than the <a href="http://www.sltrib.com/2004/Jan/01182004/commenta/130055.asp">ongoing fascination</a> with the fact that Howard Deans wife has continued her work while her husband is campaigning?   What are we supposed to glean from these stories?   Their marriage is in trouble?   She doesn't care about politics?   She doesn't think he can win?   She's stage shy?   Or - and bear with me here, it's a stretch - maybe she would no more trail Howard around Iowa all month than she would have him trail her through her office all day.    She's got a life, and all.   
<br />
<br />And shouldn't we be glad at the prospect of a Democratic Presidential candidate whose wife is not angling for a raft of her own policies?  (<em>read: Hillary and Tipper</em>)</strong>
