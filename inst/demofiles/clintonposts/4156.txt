Myerson on the state of the party<br />
BY JESSE MYERSON</p>

<blockquote>42 senators (one Independent, one Republican and the rest Democrats) voted against confirming Sam Alito as an Associate Justice to the Supreme Court, but, in the debate over his nomination, only 25 senators voted against cloture (cloture ends debate and moves to an up-and-down vote). Had the 42 who voted against his confirmation likewise voted against cloture, they would have blocked him from gaining a seat on the highest court in the most powerful nation in the world.  Now, a radical rightward shift of that body is all but inevitable.

<p>     If those 42 senators actually do oppose Sam Alito for the reasons listed in their officesâ press releases regarding their votes against his confirmationânamely that he will legitimate crimes the Bush administration has committed, that he supports revolutionary consolidation of executive powers, that he is biased in favor of corporations and Christian groups, and against workers and minoritiesâwhy did they not do all that they could to ensure blocking him?</p>

<p>     The answer is indicative of a much larger problem within the Democratic Party: that it is an opposition Party whose oppositional strategy, counter-intuitively, is triangulation. By contrast, they oppose a majority party whose majority strategy is to fight like hell for an extremely radical cause and never give up an inch. Those who voted âayeâ on cloture but ânayâ on confirmation wanted to appear principled by actually eschewing principle. They cast a symbolic vote for justice while casting a meaningful vote for just the opposite.</p>

<p>     Conventional wisdom holds that had those âaye-but-nayâ Democrats filibustered Alito (filibuster means to prevent cloture), they would have been labeled âobstructionistsâ and defeated in their upcoming elections. The same âconventional wisdomâ is present here that makes Massachusetts Senator John Kerry vote for the war in Iraq so he does not seem âsoftâ on âNational Security;â and New York Senator Hillary Clinton oppose single-payer health care to avoid being considered socialistic. To their credit, both Mr. Kerry and Ms. Clinton voted against cloture, but again, the cloture vote is not the disease, merely a symptom.</p>

<p>     I say that the lives and well being of the American people are worth some senators appearing âsoftâ on âNational Security,â or being socialistic; because as the late Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota said, âPolitics is not about power. Politics is not about money. Politics is not about winning for the sake of winning. Politics is about the improvement of peopleâs lives. Itâs about advancing the cause of peace and justice in our country and the world. Politics is about doing well for the people.â</p>

<p>     The irony of it all is that triangulation (read: taking the base for granted, while pandering to Independents and right-wingers), which âconventional wisdomâ maintains is the key to Democratic success, is the catalyst for Democratic demise. It was during the Clinton era of triangulation, when the government was trying to be all things to all people, that the Democrats lost one house of Congress and then the other. Finally, the Republican majority in those chambers increased and the Democrats lost (debatably) two presidential elections along the way.</p>

<p>     Meanwhile, Wisconsinâs Russ Feingold, the closest current Senator to the aforementioned Mr. Wellstone, both in electoral strategy and political position, manages to remain quite popular in a rather centrist state. Senator Feingold was the one senator to vote against the USA PATRIOT Act (this was when Wellstone was still in office).  Feingold remains the only senator to propose a concrete timeline for the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq; he recently led the charge to prevent drilling for oil in Alaskaâs Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Despite being the most progressive member of the Senate, Feingold managed to win many Wisconsin counties that went to President Bush in 2004. Conventional wisdom, it seems, is wrong.</p>

<p>     Here is a much wiser wisdom: that Americans like it if leaders stand up for what they say they believe in. The Gang of 14 chose to filibuster judges who they said must not be allowed to judge? Good.  Then they ought not to have compromised and allowed those judges to be confirmed. John Edwards promised hundreds of people in Copley Square on November 2 that he and John Kerry wouldnât concede until all the ballots were counted? Good. Then they should not have conceded the next day, as massive reports of voting irregularities were surfacing. Somehow the Republicans seem to win without seeming like Democrats. Shouldnât then, in a country that is roughly as progressive as it is conservative, the Democrats be able to win without seeming like Republicans? It is time to look to the Republicans for tips on winning.</blockquote></p>
