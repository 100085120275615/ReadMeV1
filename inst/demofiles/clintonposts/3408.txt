<div>My girlfriend is a big fan of Hillary (Clinton, of course).  My roommate is less of a fan, but a bigger one than I am.  Sometimes they gang up on me a bit.<br />
<br />The gf thinks that Hillary should be the democratic nominee in 2008 and that she'd win.  I'm a bit more skeptical.  Will a woman really be able to pull enough many middle of the road voters?  And aren't a lot of republicans still bitter towards the Clintons?  (Not that they wouldn't hate anyone the democrats put forth.)  But the gf insists that people like the Clintons and that as a woman she can pull in a lot of them middle of the road female voters.<br />
<br />All I know is that I keep getting surveys in the mail from Hillary and these surveys always ask the same stupid questions.  I threatened to send the survey back with the comments: "Even if I gave you my opinion you wouldn't make any use of it anyway because it's too liberal for you.  Of course, I'm guessing the real reason you send out these surveys is to try to convince middle of the road types and I'm not one of them, so save your stamp.  If you win the nomination I'll vote for you, of course, and maybe even campaign for you or something.  But I'd do the same for any democratic (i.e. the lesser of the evils) candidate."  But alas, gf and roomie told me not to.<br />
<br />There is one sense in which I would be excited for Hillary to run--there's a great song just waiting to be her campaign's them song.  Anybody heard "Hillary's Eyebrows" by Phranc?  Here's some of the lyrics:<br />  <br />
<span>Hillary's eyebrows aren't the same color as the hair on her head<br />But that's okay, I'd rather have a new...health plan instead<br />And it's alright with me<br />If her eyebrows don't match perfectly<br />
</span>.<br />.<br />.<br />
<span>Cuz when they're furrowed, when they're arched<br />They can't help but give me a spark<br />Of hope that someday I will be<br />Half as smart as...Hillary<br />
<br />

<br />I can see it now, bumperstickers saying Clinton '08 with two big bushy eyebrows over the 0 and 8 !!!!</div>
