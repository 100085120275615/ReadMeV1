<div>Reading the headlines could make a person crazy, especially if your an anti-American Moveon.org Democrat and not a real Democrat.<br />
<br />Consider:<br />
<br />Jimmy Carter, the alleged âbest and nicest ex-president in historyâ goes to Germany to trash America in Der Speigel but wonât do it in America for the Moveon-Democrats.<br />
<br />Howard Dean on behalf of Moveon-Democrats, dumps on the real Democrat primary/caucus calendars and threaten to excommunicate any Democrat who complains about it.<br />
<br />Moveon-Democrats are trying to kick Joe Lieberman out of the party because he disagrees with them on exactly one issue.  So much for the big tent theory for lock-stepping Moveon-Democrats.<br />
<br />Republicans are out fund-raising Moveon-Democrats by 3 to 1, despite Deanâs so-called miraculous netroots money raising prowess.<br />
<br />Rap music, the anthem for Moveon-Democrats, is demeaning and impregnating girls. Who would have guessed Moveon type music could do that. I always thought it was males.<br />
<br />Bill Cosby has had the temerity to demand that blacks take personal responsibility contradicting Moveon-Democrats that no one, except Republicans, are personally responsible for anything they may want to do.  <br />
<br />Bill Clinton turned 60, which turns off Moveon-Democrat women, who wanted to cheat on Hillary with him. <br />
<br />And the worst cut of all, anti-birth, pro-abortion, Moveon-Democrats are having 41% fewer children than Conservatives.  What would you expect when Moveon-Democrats are demanding that they be allowed to kill their  babies.  Even a Moveon ought to be able to figure this one out.  <br />
<br />Itâs a tough life out there being a Moveon-Democrat these days.<br />
