<span>North of Fallujah when they came upon an Iraqi terrorist, badly injured and unconscious. On the opposite side of the road was an American Marine in a similar but less serious state.</span>

<br />
<span>The Marine was conscious and alert and as first aid was given to both men, the squad leader asked the injured Marine what had happened. </span>

<br />
<span>The injured Marine reported, "I was heavily armed and moving North along the highway here, and coming South was a heavily armed insurgent. We saw each other and both took cover in the ditches along the road. I yelled to him, 'Saddam Hussein is a miserable, lowlife scumbag', and he yelled back, 'Ted Kennedy is a good-for-nothing, fat, left wing liberal drunk'.  So I said, 'Osama Bin Ladin dresses and acts like a frigid,mean-spirited lesbian'! He retaliated by yelling, 'Oh yeah? Well, so doesHillary Clinton'! And, there we were, in the middle of the road, shaking hands, when a damn truck hit us".</span>
