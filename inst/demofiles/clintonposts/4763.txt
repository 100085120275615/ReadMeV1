<p>The 2008 presidentail campaign season will officially begin in a matter of weeks, however we are seeing some interesting <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/38576">developments </a>already. </p>

<blockquote>Senator McCain's latest additions to his 2008 presidential campaign team Ã¢â¬â a veteran of Democrat Howard Dean's presidential campaign, and a former Bush administration State Department official Ã¢â¬â are setting Washington to speculating about the ideological direction Mr. McCain's run for the White House might take.</blockquote>

<p>I can give you a hint about the ideological direction the McCain camaign is going to head.</p>
        <p>John McCain is going to go John Kerry on us. You will see the similarities in campaign styles right off the bat. The driving force behind the campaign will be the President's low approval rating. Most of those desparate for a shot at the ultimate cheeseburger that is the White House can only win by separating themselves from a policy they see as failing, with regards to the war in Iraq. </p>

<p>"I would do much the same thing, only I would do it differently," will be the phrase that pays!</p>

<p>This will also be about retribution. McCain, Armitage, Powell, Scowcroft - they all have an axe to grind with the Bush administration. They'll make a great team of mostly centrists. This election season will be all about reaching out to the Democrats who want to see the war shortened at any cost and those republicans who are unable to believe the professionals when they say we are making progress in Iraq and in the war on terror. </p>

<p>The McCain presidential bid is going to be based upon something Hillary Clinton has not acheived - support from the American middle. </p>

<p>Mind you, I will oppose McCain's bid for the nomination. I believe he has worked in many ways to neuter the Republican majority in the Senate. So much more could have been accomplished with his support and he just didn't do the right thing. I believe his "Gang of 14" involvement kills his chances of having support from conservatives overall. </p>

<p>But I also believe McCain's involvement in the "Gang of 14" was designed to distance himself from Senate republicans for exactly the purpose he'll gain from them in his bid for the republican nomination. My guess is he will fail, but at what cost to the Republican effort overall in 2008?</p>
