There is something so right, maybe inevitable, about Michael Bracewell invoking Kathy Acker in his foreword to <i>The Edgier Waters: 5 Years of 3:AM Magazine</i> â she is a constant presence in the collection as it totters across the broken glass path between punk and sex; indeed it could be said that she, along with writers like Jim Thompson, Derek Raymonde and the ubiquitous Ballard are like the booksâ bone marrow, itâs bristling DNA. This unholy quartet informs the anthologyâs queasy aesthetic and gives it its thrusting energy- one leaves smiling, feeling frustrated, dazzled, pummelled, pissedâ¦<br />
<br />
There is also something very right about the alliance between <a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/" target="_blank">3:AM</a> and <a href="http://www.snowbooks.com/" target="_blank">Snow Books</a>: an online magazine set up to provide a somewhere for all the music, fiction and poetry that didnât quite fit the waxy hegemony of the literary establishment, a platform to promote writers who âhave unique opportunities to have sex with women who wear glassesâ; and a fiercely independent publishers who took it upon themselves to publish only books they believed in, or fitted their self-confessed naÃ¯ve ideology, a manifesto that led them to the Small Publisher of the Year award for 2006. <br />
 <br />
So, the result: an anthology of outsider genius, set to change lives etc. Well no, not quite; but then that would kind of miss the point really. It doesnât take itself that seriously and part of its anti-establishment glare â an essential part of punkâs tawdry glamour - is a nihilistic teenage grunt. But really, we need to know about this stuff donât we? Donât we?<br />

Richard Marshallâs cogent essay on â<a href="http://www.3ammagazine.com/politica/apr2001_stuart_home.html" target="_blank">The Defiant Prose of Stewart Home</a>â somehow feels central to the plot here: a celebration of atypical outsider genius â ranter, despot, art terrorist, working class hero â and a marker for the hopelessness of any kind of revolution. Marshall places Home in the tradition of street ravers, politically agitative radicals stirring up the working classes with their prose, their actions. Indeed he sees this archetype as essentially working class- an archetype that has all but disappeared; and as such Homeâs antithetical take on this role is to smash art to bits, or to assault it, to shatter what Marshall calls the âEliotic hegemonyâ of middle-class dominated art. In this context, works like <i>Cunt</i> and <i>69 Things To Do With A Dead Princess</i> certainly make a lot more sense, and are defiant in the fact that they confront criticism and have an unimpeachable air, hold a distorting mirror up to the usual modes of discourse and analysis. But butâ¦and this is mainly an experiential thing for me with Home: so what. Is there anything beyond the nihilistic grunt, the static defiance? If itâs relatively straightforward to pinpoint what Home does, and why he does it, it isnât as easy to nail down the last of that critics triumvirate: <i>is it worth it</i>?<br />
<br />
And I guess thatâs the point then with this anthology: is it worth it? Whatâs to be gained from reading three of the massively prolific Billy Childishâs scrawled verses, the blank TV poems of <a href="http://www.books.blatt.cz/" target="_blank">Travis Jeppesen</a>? Why is it âedgyâ and not just self-obsessed, sliding into a parody of itself? I think, finally itâs a slave and a salute to the medium from whence it came. Itâs precisely prolific and blank, scattergun and angry; and precisely like some corner-of-the-world late-night TV station hosing out DIY pictures of council estates, gay bars, crack houses. And it stands and falls by <i>those</i> criteria, not those of the smug Booker judges or the Eggers crew; by design itâs brief and aimed at short attention spans, jittery trigger-happy night dwellers.<br />
<br />
Finally then, I wonder if much of the work on show here suffers from being between the pages of a book; itâs almost like a sugar rush: after a while, the defiance becomes numbing, and it comes dangerously close to blurring into one. You almost wish that instead of this neat interface you were stumbling across these scrawlings on toilet walls: Susannah Breslinâs âFetish Alphabetâ stencilled in some back alley eye clinic; Bruce Bendersonâs â<a href="http://3ammagazine.com/litarchives/2005/sep/gay_writing.shtml" target="_blank">Gay Writing; Gay Ass Fucking</a>â boomed out on public address systems on the underground; Tim Parkâs â<a href="http://3ammagazine.com/magazine/issue_3/articles/love_eros_tim_parks.html" target="_blank">Eros</a>â essay clattering through letterboxes, renegade junk mail. <br />
<br />
There's a paradox here that I'm singularly failing to articulate. This book and it's jagged contents <i>need</i> to exist, but I wonder too if literature, and the book, might just be the hardest art form to hijack. This anthology's brilliant energy seems dampened somehow, needs to break out, away from where it feels too safe; back, back to the edgier waters... <br />
