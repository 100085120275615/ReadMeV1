<div>Top five reasons I support the electoral college:<br />
<br />
<b>5.)</b> It limits the control one certain region has over the rest of the country.  Take NYC for example...most populous city in the U.S, also one of the most liberal.  Yes, it may be simple-minded to assume that just because people live in a certain area of the country, it affects their ideology, but Hillary Clinton is one of their senators.  They buy into the propaganda; many people mindlessly support democrats because "everyone else is doing it"....although the same could be said for the south and republicans.  <br />
<br />
<b>4.)</b> The electoral college has been our method of deciding the winner of elections since this country was founded....and the majority has lost only twice.  Not bad odds.  <br />
<br />
<b>3.)</b> Because it's super fun to be one of the only people I know who fully understands the electoral college.  <br />
<br />
<b>2.)</b> Because the electoral college isn't just a way of deciding elections.  It's the basis of our represenative government.  I mean, the number of electoral votes a state has is the number of Congressmen and Senators they have.  Which is based on the population of the state.  I mean, every state has two senators, but each state has a certain number of districts, and each district has a represenative in congress.  If we did away with the electoral college, would we keep the rest our government the same?  <br />
<br />And the number one reason I support the electoral college......<br />

<b>1.)</b>.....the words "President Al Gore" strike fear into my heart.  THANK YOU ELECTORAL COLLEGE!</div>
