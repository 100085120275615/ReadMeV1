<span>The pilot was sitting in his seat and pulled out a .38 revolver.<br />He placed it on top of the instrument panel, and then asked the<br />navigator, "Do you know what I use this for?"<br />The navigator replied timidly, "No, what's it for?"<br />The pilot responded, "I use this on navigators who get<br />me lost!"<br />The navigator proceeded to pull out a .45 and place it on his<br />chart table. The pilot asked, "What's that for?"<br />"To be honest sir," the navigator replied, "I'll know we're lost<br />before you will."<br />

<span>One day the pilot of a Cherokee 180 was told by the tower to<br />hold short of the runway while a MD80 landed The MD80 landed, rolled<br />out, turned around and taxied back past the Cherokee.<br />Some quick-witted comedian in the MD80 crew got on the radio and<br />said, "What a cute little plane. Did you make it all by yourself?"<br />Our hero the Cherokee pilot, not about to let the insult go by,<br />came back with: "I made it out of MD80 parts. Another landing like that<br />and I'll have enough parts for another one."<br />

<span>The Michaels family owned a small farm in Canada, just yards away from<br />the North Dakota border. Their land had been the subject of a minor<br />dispute between the United States and Canada for generations. Mrs.<br />Michaels, who had just celebrated her ninetieth birthday, lived on the<br />farm with her son and three grandchildren.<br />
<br />One day, her son came into her room holding a letter. "I just got some<br />news, Mom," he said. "The government has come to an agreement with the<br />people in Washington. They've decided that our land is really part of<br />the United States. We have the right to approve or disapprove of the<br />agreement. What do you think?"<br />
<br />"What do I think?" his mother said. "Jump at it! Call them right now and<br />tell them we accept! I don't think I could stand another one of them<br />Canadian winters!"<br />

<span>A man absolutely hated his wife's cat and decided to get rid of him one<br />day by driving him 20 blocks from his home and leaving him at the park.<br />As he was getting home, the cat was walking up the driveway.<br />
<br />The next day he decided to drive the cat 40 blocks away. He put the<br />beast out and headed home. Driving back up his driveway, there was the<br />cat! The man kept taking the cat further and further and the cat would<br />always beat him home. At last he decided to drive a few miles away, turn<br />right, then left, past the bridge, then right again and another right<br />until he reached what he thought was a safe distance from his home and<br />left the cat there.<br />
<br />Hours later the man calls home to his wife: "Jen, is the cat there?"<br />
<br />"Yes," the wife answers, "why do you ask?"<br />
<br />Frustrated, the man answered, "Put him on the phone, I'm lost and need<br />directions."<br />

<span>Bill Clinton started jogging near his new home in Chappaqua. But on each<br />run, he happened to jog past a hooker standing on the same street corner,<br />day after day. With some apprehension he would brace himself as he<br />approached her for what was most certainly to follow.<br />
<br />"Fifty dollars!" she would shout from the curb.<br />
<br />"No. Five dollars!" fired back Clinton.<br />
<br />This ritual between Bill and the hooker continued for days.<br />
<br />He'd run by and she'd yell, "Fifty dollars!"<br />
<br />And he'd yell back, "Five dollars!"<br />
<br />One day however, Hillary decided that she wanted to accompany her husband on<br />his jog. As the jogging couple neared the problematic street corner, Bill<br />realized the "pro" would bark her $50 offer and Hillary would wonder what<br />he'd really been doing on all his past outings. He realized he should have a<br />darn good explanation for the junior Senator.<br />
<br />As they jogged into the turn that would take them past the corner, Bill<br />became even more apprehensive than usual.<br />
<br />Sure enough, there was the hooker. Bill tried to avoid the prostitute's eyes<br />as she watched the pair jog past.<br />
<br />Then, from the sidewalk, the hooker yelled, "See what you get for five<br />bucks?"<br />

<span>Little Johnny's teacher has had it with his behavior, so she goes to the<br />principal and pleads for something to be done. The principle asks for<br />Little Johnny to be sent to his office. When Little Johnny arrives the<br />principle tries to play with his mind so he asks him something that<br />Little Johnny will think is rude.<br />
<br />"Tell me Johnny, do you know how to put a hole into another hole?" asks<br />the principle.<br />
<br />"No sir I don't" replies Little Johnny.<br />
<br />"I'm giving you to the end of the month to come back with the answer to<br />this question," says the principle.<br />
<br />The whole month passes and Little Johnny is quiet as a mouse, thinking<br />about the question, which he thinks must have a rude answer, day and<br />night. After a month Little Johnny starts with his bad behavior again<br />and the teacher pleads to the principle again, so Little Johnny is<br />called in.<br />
<br />"Tell me Johnny, did you figure out how to put a hole into another<br />hole?" asked the principle.<br />
<br />"No sir I didn't, but do you know how to put 8 holes in to another<br />hole?" asked Little Johnny.<br />
<br />"No" was the answer from the now dizzy principle.<br />
<br />"Well" said Little Johnny with a smile, "Come home with me after school<br />today and I'll show you. You see my dad has this flute with 8 holes in<br />it and if I shove it up your fucking ass, you'll see how it's done."<br />

<span>A skinny little white guy goes into an elevator, looks up and sees this<br />HUGE African American guy standing next to him. The big guy sees the<br />little guy staring at him, looks down and<br />says: "7 feet tall, 350 pounds, 20 inch penis, 3 pound left testicle, 3<br />pound right testicle, Turner Brown."<br />
<br />The small guy faints dead away and falls to the floor. The big dude<br />kneels down and brings him to, slapping his face and shaking him. When<br />the little guy finally comes around, the big guy asks him, "What's wrong<br />with you?" In a very weak voice the little guy says, "Excuse me, but<br />what EXACTLY did you say to me?" The big dude said, "I saw the curious<br />look on your face and figured I'd just give you the answers to the<br />questions everyone always asks me. I'm 7 feet tall, I weigh 350 pounds,<br />I have a 20 inch penis, my left testicle weighs 3 pounds, my right<br />testicle weighs 3 pounds and my name is Turner Brown." The small guy<br />says, "Thank God! I thought you said 'Turn around.<br />

<span>An old country preacher had a teenage son, and it was getting time the boy should give some thought to choosing a profession. Like many young men, the boy didn't really know what he wanted to do, and he didn't seem too concerned about it.<br />One day, while the boy was away at school, his father decided to try an experiment. He went into the boy's room and placed on his study table three objects:<br />a Bible a silver dollar, and a bottle of whiskey.<br />"I'll just hide behind the door," the old preacher said to himself, "and when he comes home from school this afternoon, I'll see which object he picks up. If it's the Bible, he's going to be a preacher like me, and what a blessing that would be! If he picks up the dollar, he's going to be a businessman, and that would be okay, too. But if he picks up the bottle, he's going to be a no- good drunkard, and, Lord, what a shame that would be."<br />The old man waited anxiously, and soon heard his son's footsteps as he entered the house whistling and headed for his room. He tossed his books on the bed, and as he turned to leave the room he spotted the objects on the table. With curiosity in his eye, he walked over to inspect them.<br />Finally, he picked up the Bible and placed it under his arm. He picked up the silver dollar and dropped it into his pocket. He uncorked the bottle and took a big drink.<br />"Lord, have mercy," the old man whispered, "he's gonna be a Congressman!"<br />

<span>A big city corporate lawyer runs a stop sign in a small town in Tennessee, and gets pulled over by a sheriff's deputy. He thinks that he is smarter than this hicktown deputy because he is a lawyer and is certain that he has a better education. He decides to prove this to himself and have some fun at the deputy's expense. Deputy says, "License and registration, please."<br />Lawyer says, "What for?"<br />Deputy says, "Y'all didn't come to a complete stop at the stop sign."<br />Lawyer says, "I slowed down, and no one was coming."<br />Deputy says, "You still didn't come to a complete stop. License and registration, please."<br />Lawyer says, "What's the difference?"<br />Deputy says, "The difference is, y'all have to come to complete stop, that's the law. License and registration, please!"<br />Lawyer says, "If you can show me the legal difference between slow down and stop, I'll give you my license and registration; and you give me the ticket. If not, you let me go and don't give me the ticket."<br />Deputy says, "sounds fair. Exit your vehicle, sir."<br />At this point, the deputy takes out his nightstick and starts beating the ever-loving crap out of the lawyer and says, "Do y'all want me to stop or just slow down?"<br />
