<div><p>Attempting to separate himself from the on-going&nbsp; White House mismanagement of the war in Iraq, Senator John McCain has <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14475828/">accused</a> GW and Company on their handling of the conflict.&nbsp; </p>

<p>McCain is trying to position himself for his own run at the Oval Office.&nbsp; The problem with the former &quot;McPrisoner of War&quot; is that he changes his positions more often than a prostitute on a time clock.&nbsp; One week he is GW's foe, the next he's giving him a big sickening hug.&nbsp; His flip-flops are starting to make more noise than John Kerry's.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Off the record, his press secretary said the Senator is a fan of Mariah Carey and then a day later said that he really likes Christina.&nbsp; When will McCain take a stand and say that he really supports Hillary?</p></div>
