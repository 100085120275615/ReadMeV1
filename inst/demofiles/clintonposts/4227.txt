<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<p>The cool thing about the internet today is that you can experience all kinds of things that are completely outside the world of mainstream media.  This is actually a huge threat to mainstream media which is why they are so scared.  So scared that they are trying to change the laws that maintain the internet as a neutral and democratic environment where everyone who wants a voice can have one.  The new laws would allow companies who&#8217;s only interest is money to make the internet be what ever they want it to be.  It seems they don&#8217;t care that this is how we research new things, this is how we meet people, and this is how we talk to each other.  And it really knocks the wind out of our project because one of the reasons we are able to keep working on Four Eyed Monsters so relentlessly is that we like to think that we are moving towards an era where an individuals voice is only going to get stronger and stronger, but if it&#8217;s all just going to be taken away and phissle out, then we have to ask ourselves, what are we building here?</p>
<p>Call your local representatives, I mean literally call, as in pick up the phone right now and call, and explain to them your thoughts.  We have till wednesday to derail what mainstream media is trying to do to declare war on independent media.<br />
Call your representative at:<br />
<h2>202-224-3121</h2>
<p>What to say when you call.  &#8220;The internet needs to stay neutral, a two tier internet system is a bad idea because the small guys will loose their voice.  This will undo everything the internet is supposed to represent and in the long run could be really bad for the economy.  Bottom line, I won&#8217;t vote for you ever again you if you don&#8217;t stand up for this issue.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which representatives to talk to, these are the twelve that are going into a meeting tomorrow morning (wednesday the 7th of June 2006)</p>
<p>So fill up their voice mails so that there assistants will tell them before they enter the meeting that this is important to the public.</p>
