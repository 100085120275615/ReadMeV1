<div><p>Hillary Clinton wants to set up a system so that anyone using an electronic voting machine will get a receipt so they know who they voted for. This is yet another attempt by her to treat voters like children. Why donât you have my mom stand behind me in the booth so she can check my ballot?</p>

<p>And everybody can have their grandparents go to the polling place with them.  That way, when people vote for Nader, they can take their vote and use it to wipe!</p>

<p>Jesus Christ woman, get over it.  You lost in 2000.  Walk it off and run a decent campaign for President, youâre making Rosie OâDonnell seem chipper and accessable.</p>

<p>Who you vote for is supposed to be confidential and nobody is supposed to know including the machine. You think Howard Deanâs supporters want people going to back to New Hampshire and Iowa and outing them for voting for that idiot?  </p>

<p>Hereâs how democracy works: you get one vote. You screw it up. Too bad. If you are too stupid to figure out how to vote then your vote shouldnât count. If you punched the wrong chad then you will just have to live with whatever candidate you voted for. You made a mistake, now you have to learn from it. </p>

<p>Speaking of learning from your mistakes, howâs your marriage working out, Hillary?</p></div>
