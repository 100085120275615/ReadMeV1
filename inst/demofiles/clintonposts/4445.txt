<p>Despite a shaky track record for predicting the final nominee, sometime next year the MSM and a slew of '08 hopefuls will descend on IA for the first '08 straw polls. The rest of the nation may not care a wink, but for hardcore observers (that means you) the results are at least a snapshot of each candidate's momentum and organizational competence. On line, however, straw polls are conducted almost every month. The frequency of these contests allow for a greater sense of momentum, and the technology allows for a more detailed picture of where each candidates support is coming from, and where it might go once that candidate is forced out of the race. The results from <a href="http://www.gopbloggers.org/augustpollresults.php"><b>GOP Bloggers</b></a> 8/25-27 '08 straw poll are a great example of on line straw poll potential.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gopbloggers.org/augustpollresults.php"><b>GOP Bloggers</b></a> conducted their latest online '08 straw poll over the weekend. Compared to their July numbers, the biggest winners were ex-Speaker <b>Newt Gingrich</b>, ex-NY mayor <b>Rudy Giuliani</b>, and MA Gov. <b>Mitt Romney</b>. Sen. <b>George Allen</b>'s (VA) '08 hopes were "devastated" by the macaca incident. The straw poll asks readers which '08ers are "acceptable" or "not acceptable" and allows readers to select their top choice. Only Allen, Gingrich, Giuliani, and Romney have net positives (Sen. <b>John McCain</b> (AZ) has the 3rd highest neg net rating at 33%).</p>

<p><b>Machiavel</b> at <a href="http://www.redstate.com/blogs/machiavel/2006/aug/27/the_first_post_macaca_straw_poll"><b>RedState</b></a> observes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Macaca incident has clearly devastated Allen's numbers in the blogosphere, his stronghold. ... Once undefined, he has now been defined in a hugely negative way, dropping to fourth with 11.5% support.</li>
<li>Who's the new conservative "it" candidate? Newt! The conservative mantle has shifted to Newt over the last few months. He got a huge boost last month for being all over the Israel-Hezbollah war.</li>
<li>Giuliani and Romney show positive movement. There's a consistent pattern of Romney and Giuliani momentum among a few of the bigger blogs participating in the poll. Among RedState readers, Romney moved up a net 10.9% and Giuliani a net 10.8% in acceptability. On RealClearPolitics, Romney moved up 18.9% to Giuliani's 12.5%. On Blogs for Bush, Giuliani moved up 22.8% and Romney was up 14.8%.</li>
<li>McCain supporters love Giuliani and Giuliani supporters are pretty fond of Romney. A handy reference should either of the two offline frontrunners falter.</li>
</ul>

<p>The final first choice results looked like this:</p>

<p>Giuliani    24.6%<br />
Gingrich    21.1<br />
Romney      12.8<br />
Allen	    11.5<br />
Tancredo     6.7<br />
McCain	     6.4<br />
Hagel        2.8<br />
Brownback    2.5<br />
Huckabee     1.5<br />
Frist	     1.1<br />
Pataki	     0.3</p>

<p>Lefty bloggers took note of their blogger brethren preferences. Under a header "GOP bloggers lining up behind Gingrich as insurgent" <b>Jerome Armstrong</b> at <a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2006/8/27/141628/829"><b>MyDD</b></a> writes: "They don't have the first-choice numbers from a month ago, but in August, the net movers (compared to the phone polling done) shows the candidacy of Gingrich is alive on the net; that Romney is gaining traction; Giuliani is having the strongest online/offline crossover; and McCain is trailing Tancredo in online support."</p>

But here's the deal: McCain has a credible chance of convincing large numbers of uninformed liberals that he is compatible with a progressive agenda. ... Therefore: when folks jump up to help McCain achieve this, there's got to be a price -- even when they're friends of ours. That doesn't mean we stop being friends with them, or that we do anything mean. It just means don't let them have it both ways when it comes to politics and business.

If he decides to run for the Senate, I expect some conservative will challenge him. ... And after 2-4 years of hearing Sen.

<blockquote>

<p>While the rise of the blogosphere, netroots and Internet politics are very exciting, money still makes politics go. And more to the point here, money let's politicians go. To wit: The ground war (grass-roots organizing) and the air war (TV) in the first round of caucuses and primaries will cost more this year since it will take place virtually simultaneously in two states in distinct parts of the country. And bopping the candidate around those four states? The price of jet fuel isn't dropping, in case you haven't noticed.<br />
Broadening the primary, making it more national -- this only benefits the candidate with deep bank accounts. And while Mrs. <b>Clinton </b>has a host of potential problems, being cash-strapped won't be one of them.</blockquote><br />

Hanft offers five supporting arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>1.It brings up the worst of the old lefty imprint. I'm not the first to say this, and I hope I won't be the last. Bashing America's largest company is redolent of a messianic extremism that will not bring back the Reagan Democrats.</li>
<li>2.It's hypocritical. There are a lot of companies who are worse corporate citizens than Wal-Mart, whether it comes to health insurance coverage or being the agent of child labor around the world, or energy policy.</li>
<li>3.It's a distraction from the real work the Democrats need to do in creating a coherent narrative.</li>
<li>4.It's not even the best way to address the widening income gap.</li>
<li>5.It's too late. Wal-Mart has seen the green light, even Al Gore has praised their environmental commitment and embrace of sustainability. Geez, they've even joined the National Gay and Lesbian Chamber of Commerce.</li>

<p><a href="http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/08/cluelessness-in-print.html"><b>The News Blog</b></a> hits back with the case against the low-price leader:</p>
<ul>
<li>It supports Republicans. The vast majority of their political support goes to the GOP.</li>
<li>It is virulent anti-union. It spends millions to prevent the unionization of their stores. It is clear that in North America, stores that unionize will be closed. Which is why Wal Mart hasn't opened in New York.</li>
<li>It's expansion plans have drawn repeated grass roots opposition in blue areas like Chicago and New York. Chicago just passed a forced hike in the minimum wage for Wal Mart.</li>
<li>The cost of health care by the miserable insurance Wal Mart has provided has created legislative action.</li>
<li>Wal Mart is a miserable corporate citizen, who's gained such a bad reputation that they have to now make minor concessions to public outrage.</li>

<p><b>Joejoejoe</b> at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/25/54356/1288"><b>DailyKos</b></a> has a more in depth look at Lieberman's role in FEMA's transition into DHS, including: "Lieberman ignored the advice of many Democratic experts and pushed ahead with his own vision for DHS. People of good will can disagree but shouldn't the Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee and later Ranking Member do some kind of operational oversight to ensure his vision was actually being fulfilled?

<p>At <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bob-geiger/reporting-accurately-on-r_b_28058.html"><b>The Huffington Post</b></a>, <b>Bob Geiger</b> looks at blogger pressure on Senate Dem Leader <b>Harry Reid</b> (D-NV) to strip Lieberman of his committee assignments and counsels for cooler heads: "Joe needs to go -- and quickly. And, while many of the calls for harsh action from Reid may be righteous, bloggers castigating him for not stripping Lieberman of his committee assignments ... are simply wrong and not reporting accurately on what is or is not within Reid's authority. ... Based on that procedural construct, Harry Reid can't just unilaterally, or even by a closed vote of the Democratic caucus, strip Lieberman of his committee assignments."</p>

It's probably one of his last Democratic-based sources of money. ... Now I don't pretend to know the ins-and-outs of the gazillionaire scene in NYC, I can't imagine anything more boring than that, but Hillary controls a lot of money in that town. And even if she can't pull Rattner out of Lieberman's pocket, she can put pressure on his circle as well. Hillary is the queen bee of NY politics these days.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Ned Lamont supports the plan advocated by senators John Kerry and Russ Feingold, which calls for a phased withdrawal over the next year. But Lamont has also  indicated that in the interests of party unity, he'd also be supportive of an open-ended phased withdrawal, if his party deemed that the better way to go. That's actually a flexible position -- it's a preference for withdrawal within a year, but tempered by a willingness to draw out the withdrawal over a longer period if that's what his party's consensus dictates. It's not solely a rigid commitment to a single arbitrary date.</blockquote><br />
