<span>I can't believe I sat through this shit.</span><br /><br />As some of you may know, I used to work as a celebrity interviewer for an entertainment website (I think my <a href="http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0407201">last interview</a> is still my favorite.)  Anyway, this required that I actually attend the movies I was supposed to talk about, apparently under the assumption that seeing Starsky and Hutch would make me <span>less </span>likely to want to punch Ben Stiller in the mouth. Frankly, I don't understand the rationale either. At any rate, here are the 5 worst movies I saw this year. (Keep in mind I didn't see nearly every film out there.)<br /><br /><span>No. 5: The Girl Next Door</span><br /><br />How many times must I explain this to you? If it is an integral part of your story that people get naked, you MUST give audiences the money shot. Boogie Nights? Money shot. The Full Monty? Money shot. The Girl Next Door? Not one scene with a naked <a href="http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0404051">Elisha Cuthbert</a>. Sweet Jumping Jesus on a pogo stick, it's not that hard. Several things worth mentioning: At the roundtable interviews we actually took bets as to what drug the guy was on (You know, the guy. The dude from the movie. What's his name.)  I literally gave $5 to the reporter from IGN because crystal meth sounded the most plausible. Another thing: I peed next to the director of this movie at the screening. The next day he went on and on about how The Girl Next Door was Risky Business for a new generation. Sir, I have peed next to Tom Cruise. Tom Cruise was a friend of mine. You sir, are no Tom Cruise.<br /><br /><span>No. 4: Garden State</span><br /><br />"That movie was wicked retahded and anyone who likes it is retahded and if you liked it you are retahded." - My friend Brad from Boston.<br /><br /><span>No. 3: Agent Cody Banks: Destination London</span><br /><br />I know, I know. It's a kid's movie. But fuck that, I had to sit through the motherfucker. For starters, the girl they got to play "<a href="http://imdb.com/gallery/ss/0358349/Ss/0358349/M349CBD1047.jpg?path=pgallery&path_key=Spearritt,%20Hannah">not Hillary Duff</a>" in this one is actually <span>older </span>than me, and yet somehow manages to both look around 14 AND get seduced by <a href="http://www.cinecon.com/news.php?id=0403092">Frankie Muniz</a>.  The only good thing to come out of this movie was that I got invited to a celebrity basketball game as a result and managed to <a href="http://shawnla.blogspot.com/2004/03/final-boxcore-from-frankie-muniz.html">block a shot</a> by Jonathan Lipniki, the little kid from Jerry Maguire. "The human head weighs 8 lbs, bitch!"<br /><br /> <span>No. 2: Godsend</span><br /><br />"Hello this is Robert DeNiro. I was curious if I was still relevant?"<br />"No."<br />"Oh, well, it's just that I was, you know, in it for the money and-"<br />"Wait. Are you phoning in an apology? For a performance you phoned in!"<br />"Oh, umm, - click-"<br /><br /><span>No. 1 Tie:</span> <span>Troy and The Chronicles of Riddick.<br /></span><br />Here's all you need to know about The Chronicles of Riddick. I was invited to the premiere. I walked down the red carpet in front of Vin Diesel himself. For God's sake I sat mere rows in front of the man, and yet I left the movie halfway through! I couldn't even watch the whole thing. That, friends, is a piece of shit.<br /><br />Honorable mention: White Chicks, Starsky and Hutch, Anchorman, King Arthur, The Punisher.<br /><span></span>
