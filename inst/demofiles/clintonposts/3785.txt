<div>You know, you really have to have a great sense of humor to make fun of the misery of others.<br />
<br />There have been so many instances where I see the PWCTC (people who call themselves conservatives) laugh and make merry about pain and suffering. Whether it's torturing a cat, a dinosaur (seen it), or some slob in a foreign prison, nothing brings glee to these people like pain and suffering.<br />
<br />So check out this post at The Jawa Report. Hilarious, isn't it?<br />

<br />(Ok, the sugartits one is pretty funny. uh, and the Jew Terminators.)<br />
<br />Check out the photoshopped Vietnam pictures, especially, though.<br />
<br />I mean, look at this one! They put that bust of Hillary in with an injured Lebanese man.<br />
