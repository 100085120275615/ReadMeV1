<div>Kathleen Paynter of the Seattle Times appears to be going on a safari to Botswana.  <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/paynter/273273_paynt09.html" target="_blank">
<strong>She has self-righteously left a list of to-dos for Seattle</strong>. </a> Not many people read Paynterâs emotionally baiting and loose-with-the-facts columns these days.  But, this one is worth it, if only as a concise summary of the key social re-constructionist themes coming out of Seattle chattering class.  These are all things worth working on, almost a rallying cry, except when Paynter says âgo leftâ on these issues, most of us are better served by turning hard to the right.<span class="fullpost"> <br />
<br />Here is a sampling.<br />
<br />Paynter wants us to stop supporting Tim Eyman.  His efforts to cut taxes get in the way of the insatiable appetite of politicians.  One of Eymanâs best initiatives limited property tax increases to 1% per year.  This one got shot down this week by an activist King County judge under false pretenses.  Theyâll do anything to knock down obstacles to grabbing more of your hard earned money, it seems.  <br />
<br />With a mayor like Greg Nickels, who states that he likes every tax and spend proposal on this yearâs ballot, we can expect massive property tax increases pushed through as quickly as possible.  Eyman is the energizer bunny of initiatives, however, so heâll be back with a new one protecting middle-class families from further property tax rape.  Task number one is to support him.<br />
<br />Regarding the Viaduct, Paynter wants us to pretend that Seattle politicians have the credibility, even the sanity, to make sound decisions.  And, then let them act on those decisions.  On the Viaduct, however, I say âdo nothingâ is the best option.  Credibility and sanity are in short supply in Seattle politics these days.  Letâs leave the problem for another generation.  Hopefully, they will vote more sensible and responsible people into government.  In the meantime, if you are afraid the Viaduct will fall during an earthquake, donât drive on or below it. It's that simple. <br />
<br />If you live outside Seattle, you should love the do nothing option.  Really, thereâs not much reason to go into Seattle these days anyway.  You are only extremely unlucky if your job is in Seattle, since most businesses realize that offices in Seattle are more trouble and expense and inconvenience than they are worth.  Nickels per-employee tax on employers aint gonna help.  Meanwhile, the atmosphere is turning toward the geriatric, with the only housing going up in the form of condos designed and over-priced for retired baby boomers.<br />
<br />Paynter doesnât want you to support changing the Constitution while she risks her broad backside becoming crocodile bait.  She prefers changing the Constitution â such as eliminating equal protection and due process â without actually telling anyone or bringing it to a vote.  This is what has happened with all of the punitive anti-male and anti-father laws <a href="http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/roberts/060530" target="_blank">
<strong>spearheaded by Hillary Rodham </strong>
</a>while she was bitch-slapping Bill around the Whitehouse, and supported by gender feminists such as Sen. Patty Murray.<br />
<br />I agree, letâs not open the Constitution to the whims of todayâs pitiful political class.  Instead, letâs enforce what we already have.  The writers of the Constitution were a miracle and a better Constitution will never be had.  VAWA III would go, as would rape shield laws, and Sims' CAO would be tossed, along with government sponsored bigotry, like SPS's Office of Racism and Equity.<br />
<br />Finally, letâs NOT emulate Canadaâs absurd attempts to pretend that itâs somehow surprising that all of the members of a recently uncovered terrorist plot were Muslim.  Let's go after these fascists, blow them up at every opportunity, and be open about their hateful, violent, and radical interpretation Islam. Doing otherwise is just fooling ourselves.<br />
<br />Oh, and lastly, letâs remember not to read Paynterâs silly column upon her return.  She will pretend to have gained earth moving insight from Botswana.  Sheâll miss the important stuff about dysfunctional and perpetually aid dependent Africa.</span>
