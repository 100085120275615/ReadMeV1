<div>Dear Friend,<br />
<br />A few minutes ago, George W. Bush used his presidential veto for the very first time when he overturned a bill passed by Congress that would expand desperately needed federal funding for stem cell research.<br />
<br />Think about that for a moment. For five and a half years, Bush never saw fit to veto a single bill. But now, when Congress votes to support research that could save millions of lives, Bush breaks out his veto stamp for the first time.<br />
<br />Stem cell research has shown promise in treating Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, diabetes, cancer, spinal cord damage, and countless other conditions and injuries. It could change the lives of every family affected by them -- spouses, parents, children. But with one small action, Bush has robbed millions of Americans and their families of hope for effective treatments.<br />
<br />It is indefensible that President Bush's first veto could cost of millions of lives. We need to stop him.<br />
<br />It's up to Congress to overturn the veto and restore the hope Bush has taken away. But that won't happen without a huge outpouring of public support to garner the votes we need in the House and Senate. Sign on today to stand with Hillary in favor of overturning Bush's stem cell veto.<br />

<br />President Bush had a choice. He could use his authority to put America on the side of life-saving science and research, or he could issue his first-ever veto to stop research, denying hope to millions of Americans. It's clear he chose wrong.<br />
<br />I doubt there's a single one of us whose life hasn't been touched by a disease or an injury that stem-cell research could one day help alleviate or even cure. With virtually limitless promise, this research is far too important for arbitrary restrictions.<br />
<br />Join Hillary in support of stem cell research and tell Congress to overturn Bush's unconscionable veto.<br />
