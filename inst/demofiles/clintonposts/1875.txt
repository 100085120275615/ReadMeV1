</a> Ned Lamont supporters have frequently utilized  Joe Lieberman's public displays of <a href="http://flapsblog.com/?p=3016">affection</a> with President Bush as a sign of him being out of touch with the Democratic Party.   Similarly, John McCain has received scorn for the semi-regularity with which he <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1188858/posts">humps the President's leg.</a>  Consider these events along with the recent man-boy love between Vladimir Putin and a young, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/07/06/russia.putin.reut/index.html">kittenish</a> lad, and of course, President Clinton's blowjob problems (no picture link for this one), which may have begun privately, but ended quite publicly.  One conclusion presents itself: public politics should be one of those "no-touching" sots of activities, just <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/5237/3205/1600/001.jpg">

</a>like Catholic school dances, women's lacrosse, and the dreaded Portuguese Man-O-War.<br />
<br />Other, less well-known PDA have had major ramifications in politics.  A few of the examples are below:<br />
<br />
<br />An early 1960s spin-the-bottle game in which Kruschev claimed that John F. Kennedy's bottle spin pointed at him, but JFK locked lips with British Prime Minister Harold <a href="http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/40172000/jpg/_40172178_jkhm203.jpg">Macmillan</a> instead, began the buildup of tension, note-passing, and rumormongering that led to the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br />
<br />Kennedy also played a minor role in the Bentsen-Quayle debate, during which Lloyd Bentsen said to Dan Quayle, "Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy." While Bentsen was largely referring to Quayle's political character, his friends also claim he held a grudge against Quayle after a "Seven minutes in heaven" session during which Bentsen claimed Quayle played "Way too much grabass." Bentsen freuquently cited Kennedy as the kind of gentleman you could trust, even during closet makeout sessions.<br />
<br />Tension between the Democratic-Republicans and the Federalists created the historical setting for the The Burr-Hamilton duel of 1804, but the duel's immediate cause was a handshake between President Jefferson and Hamilton that Burr described as "overly affectionate". On his deathbed, Hamilton later described the physical contact as "totally worth it," saying Jefferson's was "the kind of firm grip that makes you all wet and quivery inside."<br />
<br />While not literal hugs or kisses, former Senator Strom Thurmond was given a bag of Hershey's Hugs &amp; Kisses, which are chocolate "Hershey's Kisses hugged by white chocolate." Believing that the bag was a political statement from Hershey's, and that integration had come so far as to be represented in candy form, Thurmond died.</div>
