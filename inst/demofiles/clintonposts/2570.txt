Predictably, many parents don't seem to mind, like this idiot mother of a FOUR-year-old girl -- <a href="http://atlmalcontent.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/tweens.jpg"><img src="http://atlmalcontent.typepad.com/atlmalcontent/images/tweens.jpg" title="Tweens" height="126" width="150" alt="Tweens" border="0" /></a> </p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Hillary Offenberg, on the other hand, imposes few rules and is more amused than concerned about her daughterâs precociousness. Four-year-old Carly Gulotta âhas a mind of her own,â said Ms. Offenberg, a wholesale florist in New York. </p>

<p>Not without a touch of pride, she added: âMy daughter loves everything that is in fashion right now, like wearing dresses as little smock tops over pants, or mixing polka dots and plaids. </p>

<p>âShe got dressed by herself this morning in fuchsia tights. She said, âMommy, even if you say no, Iâm still wearing it.â â</p>

<p>âYou pick your battles,â Ms. Offenberg said, heaving an indulgent sigh. âCarly is a pushy broad.â </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">God forbid you tell your kid "no". </p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">Less than a decade ago the industry began courting middle-school girls, or tweens, offering clothing and accessories that seemed to have been conceived for a much older market. Today designers and retailers are training their sights on even younger consumers, girls roughly 4 to 9, diminutive in stature but with great big eyes for style. Indeed, to judge by the wares â miniaturized drainpipe jeans, footless hose, cashmere tunics and press-on nails â fashion and cosmetics makers are intent on capturing the hearts of pint-size fashionistas, and the purse strings of their parents. ...</p>

<p dir="ltr">Juliet B. Schor, the author of âBorn to Buy: The Commercialized Child and the New Consumer Cultureâ (Scribner), ascribes childrenâs heightened acquisitiveness partly to increasingly aggressive marketing. âThe very insidious thing about this,â she said, âis that kids get the message that they need this product â whether itâs a sugared cereal or the latest fashion trend â to be O.K., to be cool. That is potentially interfering with their intrinsic sense of self.<em> Kids from the very beginning are learning that your self-worth depends on what you have and how the market evaluates you.â</em></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">And their parents are facilitating it. Good thing I don't plan on having any kids. They'd be the ones wearing Toughskins. Fight fashion, and save your soul! </p>
