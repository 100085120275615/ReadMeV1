Quick Summary of the Friday Evening Follies on PBS:<br /><br />Ramesh Ponnuru proves utterly stagestruck when asked by Margaret Warner about Sen. Allen's alleged ethnic slur about a UVa Indian student being called "macaca."  Ponnuru makes David Brooks look positively testoserone-crazed in his deferential responses to Mark Shields' attacks on Republican Allen.  When Ponnuru kind of allowed that Democrats like Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton [Gandhi owning a gas station?] might have made their own ethnic jibes at Indian-Americans, Shields buffaloed him into a contrite ball of simpering surrender.<br /><br />On the always tendentious [toward the ultra left] Washington Week, the panel was unanimously female---except for Martha Raddatz of ABC who evidently felt she should be moderator, waving her arms a la Puffington Host females and painting specious Detroit Judge as a brave constitutionalist for her silly posturing against Bush's NSA policies.  After Raddatz stopped hyperventilating, the rest of the panel sagely decided that a District Judge's ruling had little or no effect, except for Raddatz's windmill arm moves reminiscent of a crazed referee.<br /><br />Andrea Mitchell flubbed some facts on the Middle East, but got the major points right.  Surprise good job from a newcomer named Linda Robinson from US News & World Report, who had an interesting take on how the Iraqi govt is trying to rein in Moqtader Sadr's imitation of Hezbollah---state within a state militia antics. Her thoughts that Sistani would play a pivotal role not new, but well expressed. <br /><br />Cummings from WSJ had her customary calming effect, a control rod in the nuclear brew lefties like Ifill, Raddatz, and even Mitchell tonight affect for the cameras.<br /><br />Finally, McLaughlin Group concurred that some sort of profiling will have to be done in order to make travel in the USA a less torturous experience.
