<span>Speeches you didn't get to hear. </span>
<br />
<br />Though I'm not at liberty to reveal my sources, I have obtained copies of several "alternate" speeches from tonight's Oscar Ceremony. I am happy to share them with my readers.<br />
<br />
<span>Morgan Freeman (Best Supp. Actor) </span>
<br />
<br />Wow. I'm so happy to be up here. Of course, I want to thank the Academy. You honor me. I would be remiss, however, if I didn't also mention my fellow nominees. Why, there's the guy who played the retarded mechanic on Wings, and the dude best known as the mischievous doctor from M.A.S.H. (Looking at Alan Alda) What are you, like 90 now? Seriously, my MOM had a crush on you. Let's not forget that dude who starred in all those BMW commercals. I don't even think HE knows who he is. And, of course, the man behind the genius that was Booty Call, the film that single handedly set back the civil rights movement three decades. Honestly, I'm the greatest living actor and this is the best you could come up with? Next time you fools best bring Kryptonite. (walks away in disgust)<br />
<br />
<span>Cate Blanchett (Best Supp. Actress) </span>
<br />
<br />Will winning an Oscar change my life? You bet asshole!*<br />
<br />
<span>Brad Bird (Best Animated Feature) </span>
<br />
<br />One day Pixar will make a bad movie. You won't hear about it though, unless of course Death gets advanced screenings. If you're lucky you might just be old and feeble, your deteriating mental faculties allowing brief but heartbreaking moments of lucidity. Just before you have your last conscious thought - a cry for a long lost girlfriend from your youth - a kind nurse will whisper in your ear that Pixar's newest "life-simulation" was a klunker. But I wouldn't bank on it. You can suck it Michael Eisner. You can suck it long and hard. I also want to thank the Academy and my lovely wife.<br />
<br />
<span>Charlie Kauffman (Best Original Screenplay) </span>
<br />
<br />If you can understand my scripts and appreciate my movies, then I want to congratulate you on being smarter than 90% of everyone else. Do you know how brillant Being John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Eternal Sunshine are? I mean, do you have any idea? You must know, right? I'll tell you what I'm doing next. It' a horror movie. Seriously, I'm not kidding you. I did it just for shits and giggles. Damn thing only took me an hour. Let me just say one thing in closing: Rhubarb.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span>Clint Eastwood (Best Director) </span>
<br />
<br />You just made my day! Haha. I crack myself up. No, but seriously, I've made a brilliant film and I truly appreciate this honor, but the fact that Martin Scorsese doesn't have, like, a half dozen of these things is a sin against nature. How many kids have Taxi Driver posters on their walls? That was thirty years ago people! Let's face it, The Aviator wasn't his best work. I'm sure he'd tell you that himself. But you should all be ashamed. May your lives be short else shame be too long. And, of course, I want to thank my lovely mother. Cheers ma!<br />
<br />
<span>Hillary Swank (Best Actress) </span>
<br />
<br />So I walked into a bar and the bartender says, "Hey, why the long face?"<br />
<br />And, finally, a man who wasn't even nominated:<br />
<br />
<span>Jesus Christ (Best Son of God) </span>
<br />

<br />*Cate Blanchett actually said this to a reporter backstage, making her, in one fell swoop, my favorite actress ever.</div>
