<p>Hah. Lamont won. Take that, you fake-Democrat Lieberman. And Gingrich <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/08/06/newt-ct/">calling Lamont voters &#8220;insurgents&#8221;</a>? A pox be on you. If I&#8217;m an insurgent when I vote for the anti-Clinton candidate come primaries, I&#8217;ll gladly dip my finger in purple paint and wave it in your face. <img src="http://www.moonbatty.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> </p>
<p>It&#8217;s called voting for what we believe in. And the Democratic voters have long since stopped believing that Lieberman is anything but a Republican.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m voting for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tasinifornewyorkorg">Tasini </a>come primaries. Yes, Tasini is the &#8220;anti war&#8221; candidate of New York. But that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;m voting for him. I&#8217;m voting for him because he&#8217;s a Democrat. Hillary quite simply is not a Democrat in many senses of the word. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tasinifornewyork.org/files/TasiniVSClinton-OnTheIssues-flier.pdf">Tasini is</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Basically, I&#8217;m sick of voting for the &#8220;lesser evil&#8221; or voting for the moderates. It&#8217;s just letting this country slide further right. So I&#8217;ll vote for someone who is left of where I am, and maybe send those moderate Democratlicans scrabbling a bit back toward the left.
