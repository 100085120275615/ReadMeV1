<div>"Die in Britain, survive in the US"
<br />
<br />Great article here by The Spectator UK. To read it all you have to register but its worth your time. Then think about which system you prefer.
<br />
<br />Which is better ï¿½ American or British medical care? If a defender of the National Health Service wants to win the argument against a free market alternative, he declares, ï¿½You wouldnï¿½t want healthcare like they have in America, would you?ï¿½ 
<br />That is the knock-out blow. Everyone knows the American system is horrible. You arrive in hospital, desperately ill, and they ask to see your credit card. If you havenï¿½t got one, they boot you out. It is, surely, a heartless, callous, unthinkable system. American healthcare is unbridled capitalism, red in the blood of the untreated poor. 
<br />For goodnessï¿½ sake, the American system is so bad that even Americans ï¿½ plenty of them anyway, if not all ï¿½ want to give it up. They want something more like the Canadian system or our own National Health Service. That is what Hillary Clinton wanted and there are still plenty of people like her around. Tony Judt, in a recent edition of the New York Review of Books, was damning about American medical care and glowing about European healthcare. Think of all the money that is wasted in America invoicing patients and administering lots of separate, independent hospitals. 
<br />At the same time, we canï¿½t help being aware that back here in Britain the NHS is not exactly perfect. The waiting lists have come down, according to the government. They have probably come down somewhat in reality, too. But they still exist and, come to that, there is the worryingly high incidence of hospital infections. So is British healthcare better than American? Or the other way round? And how do you judge? "</div>
