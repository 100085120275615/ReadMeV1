<p>Looks like <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20050222/ap_on_re_us/woman_president_poll">this poll</a> has been getting a lot of press! I first saw it as a news item on Yahoo last night (linked). Pat Kiernan also reported the results of the poll this morning on NY1.<br /><br />Later this morning on the train I also caught a glimpse of a fellow's passenger's <a href="http://www.metro.us/">METRO</a> and saw Hillary's picture. However, the piece in METRO was published in the "Local" section, which makes me wonder if this is a national story or not.?!<br /></p><p></p><p></p><p>In any case, there are some very interesting results:<br /><br /></p><span><blockquote><em><span><blockquote><span><blockquote><em><span>81 percent of people surveyed would vote for<br />a woman for<br />president and 53 percent think New York Sen. Hillary Rodham<br />Clinton should try<br />for the job.</span><br /><span></span><br /></em><em><span>The pollsters found about<br />60 percent of voters said they<br />expect a woman to be the Democrats' nominee<br />for president in 2008. In contrast,<br />they found 18 percent expected the<br />Republican ticket to be headed by a woman. </span><br /><span></span><br /></em><span><em>About 67 percent of those<br />polled said a female president would<br />be better than a male on domestic<br />issues, but only 24 percent said a woman<br />president would do better on<br />foreign policy issues. <blockquote></blockquote></em></span></span></blockquote></blockquote></span></em></span><span><span></span><p><br /><span>Frankly, I find it heartening that a large percentage believe "a woman" would be better (than a man) with domestic affairs. (I'm not at all surprised about the opinion on foreign affairs) </span></p><p><span>Also of note: NY1 reported that 53 percent of those polled said they would actually VOTE FOR HILLARY, not just that they "thought she should run," as this yahoo piece says. Of course, I'm not sure which is correct, but evidently you can download a pdf of the poll results (the file crashed my computer when I tried to do so. Caveat emptor and all....)</span></p></blockquote></span>
