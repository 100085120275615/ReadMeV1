<p>Symbiosis defined: âThe living together in more or less intimate association or close union of two dissimilar organisms.â<br />
Political symbiosis defined: Liberal Democrat Hillary Clinton and Conservative Republican Peter King attending the same events, supporting the same causes, laughing at the same jokes â and defending Clinton from Republican attacks.<br />
Yes, the last one really happened. On Tuesday, reporters were told by Clintonâs camp that she would be available the next day to respond to an attack ad by one of her would-be Republican foes, John Spencer, who suggested she helped Osama Bin Laden by opposing federal wiretaps that were not court-authorized.<br />

King and Clinton had a brief and apparently intense conversation as they walked out of the event to face the cameras.<br />
Clinton said the Spencer ad was âa terrible injustice.â The press could not resist asking the Republican, King, for his response. He did not criticize Spencer, but said of Clinton: âI would never question her integrity or her absolute commitment to winning the war on terrorism.â<br />
Was King suckered into the political flap?<br />
No way, he said in an interview the following day.<br />
That intense conversation before facing the press was Hillary warning him, âIt could get a little tough out there,â and giving him an out, he said.<br />
âShe was tipping me off,â King said. âI wouldnât sand-bag her and she wouldnât sand-bag me.â<br />
