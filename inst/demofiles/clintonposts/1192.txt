But thatâs not what Summer Redstone said.<br /><br />No, according to Redstone, the CEO of Viacom, that great respectable multinational media empire who controls the mindless propaganda of MTV and Nickelodeon, (but who couldnât control Dan Rather)â¦ Tom was fired because of his off-screen antics.<br /><br />Yes, <span>VIACOM</span> is a real respectable organization; God forbid Tom Cruise hurt its impeccable image.<br /><br />Let me see... Viacom puts out MTV, where kids can learn about pimps, how woman are whores, how to hate copsâ¦and how it pays to be a rapper and promote that culture of do nothing but rap all day about how you want yoursâ¦NOW. A fine example for the future kids of America. No, donât be a scientist, or excel in school, instead, quit school you moron and rap! Then you will get on âMTV Cribsâ and buy lots of gold chains.<br /><br />That show alone is enough to cause a class revolution. You watch and you thinkâ¦<em>some</em> of these people are morons, with no talent, no brains, and they are making millions, while I have to work two jobs, and <strong>he</strong> has five cars, some with hot tubs in the backseat.<br /><br />Nothing like pushing the class envy button, which is precisely the thing we are always hearingâ¦40% of the money is owned by one per cent of the people. (Notice itâs always the rich that tell you this.)<br /><br />The message here is; Hate the system, make a record talking about how unfair it is, then make millions, while doing drugs the rest of your days while riding in limousines, which pull up to beach front property and dancing orgyâs in Miami.â<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Redstone for promoting that message. And thatâs the older kids. Summer, (or is it Sump-pump?)who voted for John Kerry, wants the younger ones brainwashed too, and not just here.<br /><br />Nickelodeon now is the number one kid show in China.<br /><br />So, maybe, <em>just maybe</em> there was another reason for Tom Cruise being publicly fired. Tom cares about kids, he is against the schools drugging the kids with Ritalin. Heâs even gone to Congress to testify.<br /><br />The liberals kill me. They are all bellying about how âoffendedâ everyone was, including Oprah, when Tom jumped up on her couch and said â<strong>Iâm in love and very happy!â</strong><br /><br />For this episode, he is being vilified? For being in love? Love is a crime now?<br /><br />Now, I bet, <em>I just bet</em>, if Tom Cruise had jumped up on that couch and said â<strong>Iâm gay</strong>!â he would be on Time Magazine instead of Hillary, and everyone would be so proud and saying the most wonderful things about him.<br /><br />But since so many are upsetâ¦letâs take the argument about money, logically speaking.<br /><br />If big CEOâs were so concerned about money, then why hasnât Harrison Ford been âfired.â?  He had five flops in a row. FIVE. This was right after he said some real vile thing about President Bush. It was so vile and dirty, I wanted to forget it. I swore Iâd never see another movie of his again. I havenât and I wonât.<br /><br />But because I purposely forgot, now I canât find it anywhere. (okay, stupid)<br /><br />I looked for that quotation on the internet for over two hours. Itâs been erased. When you have Al Gore on Googleâs board, itâs no wonder.  Itâs been replaced, because he is coming out with a new movie about Fallujah, <em>No True Glory,</em> in which he plays a general, Jim Mattis. <br /><br />Something tells me this is NOT going to be a positive film about our boys. Harrison has said; â<em>I am very disturbed about the direction American foreign policy is going.â<br /><br /></em>So his RECENT quote is â<em>I donât talk about politics</em>.â Right. He learned his lesson after his five movie bombs. He wants you to see this film. He hoping you have forgotten that nasty comment.<br /><br />But Tom hasnât made any political statements that I can remember, but he is against drugs. Scientologists donât believe in drugs. .<br /><br />You would think that the liberals, who are against religion, would LOVE scientology, because it isnât Christianity, and it has that word they love, âscienceâ in it. Go figure.<br /><br />Also, some of the media are still mad about the Brooke Shields statement. I didnât take it that he was trying to put Brooke Shields down, in his mind; he was trying to help her. He was just saying that many depression drugs do not solve the problem, they just mask it. And heâs right.<br /><br />Where he is wrong, is that there is such a thing as chemical imbalances, but there are other ways to deal with them than the usual Prozac, and not just scientology. But hey, he was NOT trying to harm Brooke Shield with that statement.<br /><br />The usual drugs like Prozac just numb your brain, but, in post partum depression, sometimes you may <em>need</em> to numb your brain, if the choice is suicide.<br /><br />In fact, Andrea Yates should have been knocked out, and put on double dozes of Prozac, the kids would have done a better job taking care of her.<br /><br />And even if Scientology is considered odd by many (including me) , it <em>has</em> helped Tom Cruise, Kristie Alley, and John Travolta, so why is that so bad? What--- we can tolerate Islam, a religion that enslaves all women and believes all infidels should die, but <em>not</em> scientology?<br /><br />No, scientology is a threat to the pharmectiutcal business because they donât believe in drugs, and there is big money in the pharmaceuticals, and big companies seem to have bought many of our politicians from both parities.<br /><br />Tom Cruse said. â<em><strong>Itâs how you degrade a society, by drugging the piss out of it.â<br /></strong></em><br />Itâs no wonder Nicole and Tom got a divorce. His x-wife is now a member of the New World United Nations, and Tom wants to think for himself.  He has stepped off the global âdo as we say and you will be rewardedâ merry go round. Good for him.<br /><br />Think about how silly this isâ¦Tom Cruise jumped up on a couch and said he was in love. For that he gets fired? What does that mean to the rest of us?<br /><br />Never say youâre in love in public? Saying your wife is going to give up her career and take care of kids is something we must <em>never</em> mention to our boss? This is NOT on the liberal family agenda. Nickelenon is promoting love with multiple partners and gay families, and vists soon from Larry Flint coming with candy.<br /><br />When <span>Harrison Ford</span> once said "<em>Iâm in love, I guess Iâm happy</em>,â he was not attacked. They kept it pretty quiet. Love is not being promoted. We found that out with Bill and Hillary.<br /><br />He also said â<strong>Any kind of rubbish goes on the internet and it can have a @%*&king; life of its own.â<br /></strong><br />Wowâ¦I believe Harrison Ford is talking about me. I think Iâm in love.<br /><br />The lesson here is that sheer idiotic news can be presented in such a serious fashion, and repeated as gospel by all of the media, and then it becomes truth.<br /><br />They have gotten propaganda down to a fine art.Tom Cruise has been destroyed by both parties for being in love, and talking against drugs. When Redstone joins hands with Rupert Murdoch, then I suppose we will have a nation of pimps and drug uses, and unwanted children...uh ohâ¦..we already do.<br /><br />Bill Cosby has a lot of work to do. <br /><br />So daily I cruise by MTV, and take a pass on Harrison Ford.<br /><br />But, I will go and see Tom Cruise again, especially if he does another love movie.<br /><br /><br /><span><strong>Nobodyâs Perfect</strong></span>; Harrison Ford, like Bill Clinton, was a draft dodger. He supports gay marriage. He once ran his car into a post and told everyone he was putting his seatbelt on. He does not wear a wedding ring, but during his menopause stage, he put on an earring. (This made him look really stupid, but donât tell him.)<br /><br /><span><strong>Nobody Knows</strong></span>; Harrison Ford once said, â<em>I think something should be done to help alleviate the conditions which have created disenfranchised and angry factions in the Middle East.â<br /><br /></em>I suggest Harrison get together with Celine Dion and send those poor people some money.<br /><br /><span><strong>Nobody Cares</strong></span>; Tom Cruise once said âThere are people that just want to hate, period.â Rememberâ¦liberalsâ¦â<strong>All you need is loveâ¦ (Dum... da, da a da.)  Love is all you need, love is all you needâ¦love is all you need, and love is all you needâ¦â</strong>
