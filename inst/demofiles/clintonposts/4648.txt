<p>Last week, the FDA <a href="http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2006/NEW01436.html">announced</a> that it the emergency contraceptive medication, Plan B would be available over the counter for women 18 years or older, but that women under 18 years old would still need a prescription. Immediately after, Democrats including Hilary Clinton and former Virginia Governor and presumed Presidential candidate Mark Warner hailed it as a victory for women. Wha-wha-WHAT! WRONG! (For a full history on Plan B, check out <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/08/plan_b_the_behindthecounter_ov.php">my article</a> in Seed including the <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/08/the_plan_b_saga.php">timeline</a>.)</p>
<p>This is a horrible decision for women, but for a different reason then anti-abortionist conservative whackos give (that it will increase promiscuity among young women). It sets a precedent where by any drug that religious conservatives think is bad; the FDA can limit its availability. The reason they cite for not allowing women under 17 to get this drug over the counter is that its safety was not specifically studied in this age group. The only problem with that seemingly legitimate logic is that such criteria have never been used before in evaluating a drugs over the counter application.</p>
<p>In essence, the FDA caved in to anti-abortionists who still donât realize that Plan B does not cause abortions or prevent implantation of embryos. The FDA has used faulty scientific reasoning to question the safety of a drug that has been used as regular birth control in women of all ages for over 30 years and is widely available around the world as an emergency contraceptive with no adverse symptoms being reported. The drug is widely recognized as being extremely safe.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the only wacky thing about the decision; the FDA forced the manufacturer of Plan B, Barr Pharmaceuticals, to <em>&#8220;Monitor the effectiveness of the age restriction and the safe distribution of OTC Plan B to consumers 18 and above and prescription Plan B to women under 18.&#8221;</em> In other words, they are forcing the manufacturer to monitor and police pharmacies and pharmacists! That has ever been done before.</p>
<p>This is not a victory, but a total failure to keep politics out of FDA decisions and sets an ugly precedent for future FDA decisions. Now the acting director of the FDA, Andrew von Eschenbach, whose confirmation was being <a href="http://www.seedmagazine.com/news/2006/08/plan_b_the_behindthecounter_ov.php">held-up</a> by Senators Clinton and Murray, will sail through. This is despite the fact that he has failed as a leader. None f the news agencies picked up on the truth behind this story. They suck. I&#8217;m going to go eat a burrito now. Want some?
