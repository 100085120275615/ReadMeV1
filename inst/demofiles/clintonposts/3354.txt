<div>Just got done watching "Meet the Press" with Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, Congressmen Peter Hoekstra of MI and Jane Harmon of CA, and fomer (thankfully!) Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota discussing The Story that Won't Die, NSA intercepts. <br />
<br />Without giving a running diary of the entire proceedings (my dog doesn't allow that anymore, since the question "need to go potty?" was answered in the affirmative), my impression of the whole discussion was that all four of the participants think the NSA wiretaps are needed and should continue, but that Congress and not the President, should have control over them.  Not surprisinly, it was the members of the House who showed the most intelligence on the matter.  Hoekstra and Harmon both agreed that the program was good, that it was needed, and that it should continue.  It was surprising to see a Democrat taking the stance that the United States should do whatever is possible to protect itself. <br />
<br />Daschle came off as someone who badly wanted to be back in power, both as a Democrat and as a Senator.  He also re-interrated the Democrats position that we should go back to a pre-9/11 state of mind, that terrorism can be fought with warrants, courts, indictments, and convictions.  He also discussed how he was "very concerned" (it's the Tom Daschle Drinking Game!  Every time Tom is "very concerned" about something, down a shot!) about the legal ramifications of the NSA program and it's lack of warrants from the FISA courts.  Of course, when Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, or any other president circumvented the law and used their presidential authority, Tom wasn't "very concerned." <br />
<br />Rep. Harmon basically blew the Democrats whole argument out of the water when she said that she believed that the program "does fit in the law."  Yep, that's a Democrat in Congress admitting that this horrible, illegal program is completely legal.  Time to pack up the tent and go home, fellas. <br />
<br />The last thing I wanted to cover deals with the resolutions asked for by the president, and the one adopted by Congress after the 9/11 attacks.  Tim Russert read the resolution that the White House asked for on September 12, 2001 essentially asking for the authority to go after terrorists, period.  Congress then came back on September 14, 2001 with a resolution saying that the president would have the authority to go after only those responsible for the terrorist attacks of 9/11.  Notice the difference?  The White House saw the threat for what it was, and asked for the power to combat that threat.  Congress only said that the US could seek revenge.  Forget about preventing new attacks, forget about getting rid of the root of the problem itself. <br />
<br />My dad has a great saying that perfectly describes today's "Meet the Press":  The greatest threat to freedom isn't terrorism, or war, or tyrany.  The greatest threat to continued freedom of the United States is Congress.</div>
