<div>During the annual March for Life on the anniversary of legalized child sacrifice in America, George W. Bush sends in a car where he makes some useless cutesy little speech.  When Bush was campaigning for reelection against Kerry, an avowed pro-abort who claimed to be "Catholic," Bush presented himself as being "pro-life."  <br />
<br />Recently, Hillary Clinton and other extremist liberals announced plans to filibuster Bush's pick to head the FDA.  The reason?  Hillary and other extremist liberals wanted abortifacient Plan B to be over the counter and the soon-to-be head of the FDA was initially opposed.  Plan B makes sexual promiscuity even easier than before.  If a woman takes this high dose of synthetic hormones, it could prevent a conceived, living human being from implantation.  Thus, it could cause an abortion.  <br />
<br />Caving in to Hillary and other liberals, Bush's pick for the FDA suddenly changed his mind.  Obviously, a six figure salary and a powerful government post is worth more than the lives of potentially millions of innocent babies.  Bush supports this move.  Bush campaigned as a "prolife" candidate.  I voted for him on that basis.  Bush vetoed embryonic stem cell research because it destroys innocent human life.  Then he turns around and allows something that will destroy innocent human babies.  Why would Bush bow to the likes of Hillary Clinton and other extremist liberals?</div>
