<br />17 Reasons to run to the hills before Michael Moore
<br />tries to chew through Your Wrists...
<br />
<br />Fiends, Democrats, Radical Boobs, 
<br />
<br />Yes, it sucks. Really sucks. But while you go and call
<br />the suicide hotline, consider the wisdom of Monty
<br />Python, "Brave Sir Kerry ran away, bravely ran away
<br />away. When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely
<br />turned his tail and fled. Yes, brave Sir Kerry turned
<br />about, and valiantly, he chickened out. Bravely taking
<br />to his feet, he beat a very brave retreat. A brave
<br />retreat by brave Sir Kerry!"
<br />Remember, there it _NO_ good news from Tuesday's
<br />election! 
<br />
<br />Here are 17 reasons to Ignore Moore: 
<br />
<br />1. It is not against the law for Jeb Bush to run for
<br />president in 2008; and W. can run in 2012.
<br />
<br />
<i>(edit: W. can run in 2012 in the event of
<br />a constitutional amendment stating the legality of such
<br />action; most LLL/MSM freaks will have no problem believing
<br />such an amendment is possible to enact; even though the 
<br />possibility is slim)</i>
<br />
<br />2. Bush becomes the first President re-elected while
<br />gaining seats in the House and the Senate since 1936,
<br />and the first Republican President to be re-elected
<br />with House and Senate majorities since 1924.
<br />
<br />3. The only age group in which the majority voted for
<br />Kerry was young adults; young adults that will grown
<br />up inspired by Republican ideals for FOUR MORE YEARS!
<br />
<br />4. In spite of Michael Moore's wind, the majority of
<br />Americans still think the country is headed in the
<br />right direction (59,459,765), think that Moore wasn't
<br />worth listening to (59,459,765), and donât approve of
<br />the job George Soros did in attempting to force his
<br />greedy fingers into American politics (59,459,765).
<br />(Note to foreigners: Don't try to figure this one out.
<br />It's an American thing, like "moral values".) 
<br />
<br />5. The Republicans do not need a filibuster-proof
<br />60-seat majority in the Senate. If the Democrats do
<br />their job, aquiescing to Bush's mandate; in order that
<br />they have any chance at victory in 2008, they won't be
<br />able to stop the Supreme Court from the right-wing
<br />mandate. Did I say "if the Democrats do their job?",
<br />if they want to keep their party from being torn apart
<br />from within, they had better show that they can at
<br />least participate in civil bi-partisan politics.
<br />
<br />6. Michigan only voted for Kerry by 165,674 votes; almost
<br />a smaller plurality than Bush won Ohio! Kerry only won
<br />by 11,813 votes in Wisconsin. If we look at the
<br />population density map of the counties of America, we
<br />see that all the blue population centers are
<br />sandwiched between the red population centers and the
<br />ocean; if degenerate liberal-Democrats beg for a civil
<br />war, they will be crushed from mountain to shining
<br />sea!
<br />
<br />7. Once again we are reminded that the liberal
<br />Democrat is a nut. They have their polls take the
<br />pulse of America with the grace and care of a drunken
<br />proctologist with a bottle of gin (thanks Teressa) and
<br />a bull-whip.
<br />
<br />8. 99.9% of Michael Moore's support came from Pizza
<br />Hut and Krispy Kreme. In 4 years, Michael Moore's
<br />cholesterol level will be visible from outer space.
<br />Hey, 4 years isn't such a long time! If you're 15
<br />years old and reading this, your first voting years
<br />can be spent wearing a "Remeber what loser the losers
<br />voted for in 2004?" with Michael Moore's open-casket
<br />rictus grin photo (from his Doritos sponsored funeral)
<br />in _living_ color!
<br />
<br />9. Gays, thanks to Michael Moore's inept inability to
<br />influency anyone more intelligent than himself, can
<br />still do whatever they want to themselves during their
<br />honeymoons in 39 states! Thank Michael Moore. Just
<br />think of all that wedding chocolate that is left for
<br />him to eat by himself!
<br />
<br />10. Five more African Americans were elected as
<br />members of Congress, which, apparently, totally creeps
<br />Michael Moore out; almost as bad as ending a sentence
<br />with a preposition.
<br />
<br />11. The CEO of Coors will be back to rule Colorado in
<br />a few more years; too bad Michael Moore will be in a
<br />hear-attack induced coma where even the power of
<br />All-American beer can not reach him!
<br />
<br />12. Admit it: the Bush twins would never date a
<br />Democrat, especially those losers of 2004. 
<br />
<br />13. At the state legislative level, even the
<br />Democratic rats of California will be escorted back to
<br />the docks by the Governator's own mandate. 
<br />
<br />14. Moore is now a lame duck pundit. He will have no
<br />greater moment than the one he's had a month ago. It's
<br />all downhill for him from here on out -- and, more
<br />significantly, he's just not going to want to do all
<br />the hard work that will be expected of him. It'll be
<br />like everyone's last month in 12th grade -- you've
<br />already made it, so it's party time! Perhaps he'll
<br />treat the next four years like a permanent Friday,
<br />spending even more time at the drive-through or in
<br />Kentucky Fried Chicken. And why shouldn't he? He's
<br />already proved his point, avenged his appetite for
<br />self-destruction, and doubly embarassed all your
<br />asses. 
<br />
<br />15. Should Bush decide to extend sympathy to the rats
<br />of the left wing; who still attack him and compare him
<br />to Hitler; and the rats fail to escape from their
<br />downward spiral of Democrat depravity, still insisting
<br />that Bush is still trying take this country down a
<br />very dark road, only two things are possible: a) The
<br />complete and utter destruction of the Democratic Party
<br />from within, or b) the complete and utter destruction
<br />of the Democratic Party from the President's new
<br />mandate; backed up by the 59,459,765 citizens who
<br />control the moral high ground, the military, and the
<br />_will_ to fight.
<br />
<br />16. There are nearly 300 million Americans -- but the
<br />largest popular vote landslide was won by a 60% margin
<br />by Johnson in 1964, so any winning popular vote margin
<br />that's above 50% is about as close to decisive victory
<br />as it gets! BTW, Michael Moore making a sports analogy
<br />is like a fat kid trying to run from a hungry pit bull
<br />at lunch time.
<br />
<br />17. Finally and most importantly, over 59 million
<br />Americans voted for the candidate dubbed "The Winner."
<br />That's more than the total number of voters who voted
<br />for anyone in any Democracy anywhere in the recorded
<br />history of mankind! If the media are looking for a
<br />trend it should be this -- that so many Americans
<br />were, for the first time since the birth of the
<br />republic, willing to show the Geriatric Cheese Makers
<br />of Europe that no amount of anti-American sentiment
<br />from themselves and their surrogates; Michael
<br />"Cholesterol" Moore, George "Soft Money" Soros,
<br />Hillary "Hildebeast" Clinton, Albert "Al-Gorezeera"
<br />Gore, John "The Johnchurian Candidate" Kerry, and Ted
<br />"Lady Killer" Kennedy, can do anything to a real
<br />American's oppinion other than make him choose a
<br />different brand of shotgun shells with which to better
<br />deliver double-aught buck shot in response to the self
<br />destructive tendencies of the Democratic Party and
<br />their loser friends.
<br />
<br />Dear Michael Moore,
<br />
<br />Eat up!
<br />
<br />Cheers,
<br />
<br />.</div>
