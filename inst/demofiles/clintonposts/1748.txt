<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20051127/ap_on_el_se/clinton_party_challenge" target="_blank">Sweet.</a> Now Hillary, in order to ward off <a href="http://www.greenfieldforsenate.org" target="_blank">this challenge from the far-left</a>, will have to tack off her current "moderate/centrist" course to consolidate her liberal base. That should allow Jeanine Pirro to make inroads into the center, especially if this Greenfield guy can make clear the differences of Hillary's position and his position on Iraq.<blockquote>"She's in favor of the war and in favor of continuing the occupation," Steven Greenfield, a professional saxophone player, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from his New Paltz home.</blockquote>This is good; it should play well to the DUmmies, especially as the front page of his campaign website shows him being arrested at the Republican National Convention in New York City (something many Kos Kids can probably sympathize with) and refers to him as the "Peace Candidate for United States Senate." If the reports of dislike for Hillary amongst the Kossacks are true, Hillary's Senate re-election may just be a Pyrrhic victory.</div>
