<br />WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democrats' disagreements over Iraq were on clear display Tuesday as potential presidential candidates Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Kerry gave their versions to an emotional audience of party liberals.<br />
<br />Anti-war activists in the 'Take Back America' crowd booed Clinton for opposing a withdrawal date for U.S. troops, an approach pushed by Kerry and cheered by the crowd.<br />
<br />'Sometimes this is a difficult conversation, in part because this administration has made our world more dangerous than it should be,' she said.<br />
<br />Kerry, who was widely criticized as the party's standard-bearer in 2004 for being too cautious in his criticism of the war, said Tuesday that politicians 'cannot have it both ways.'<br />
<br />In remarks that could have been aimed at Clinton, Kerry said: 'It's not enough to argue with the logistics or to argue about the details. ... It is essential to acknowledge that the war itself was a mistake. ... It was wrong, and I was wrong to vote for that Iraqi war resolution.'<br />
<br />Kerry's speech featured some of his strongest comments to date, including a call to 'end a war in Iraq that weakens the nation each and every day it goes on.'<br />
<br />The Massachusetts senator is offering an amendment to withdraw troops from Iraq by the end of this year.<br />
<br />While Clinton received loud cheers for her swipes at the Bush administration, many in the crowd jeered her stance on the Iraq war. She voted for the war but has since harshly criticized the Bush administration's handling of the conflict.<br />
<br />'I do not think it is a smart strategy, either, for the president to continue with his open-ended commitment, which I think does not put enough pressure on the new Iraqi government,' said Clinton, before turning to the anti-war liberals' core beef with her.<br />
<br />'Nor do I think it is smart strategy to set a date certain. I do not agree that that is in the best interests,' said Clinton, prompting loud booing from some at the gathering.<br />[...]</blockquote>Now she's gone and pissed of the libtards too.<br />Not a good strategy there Hillary.</div>
