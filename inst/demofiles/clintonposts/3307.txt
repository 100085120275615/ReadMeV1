<div>It is almost as though the universe itself has decided that <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060821/ap_on_re_us/senate_race_mcfarland">Hillary Clinton must be re-elected</a> to the U.S. Senate.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>One of Sen. Hillary Clinton's Republican rivals suspended her campaign "until further notice" Monday following her teenage daughter's arrest on a shoplifting charge.<br />
<br />Kathleen Troia "KT" McFarland, who has been in a bitter primary fight against former Yonkers mayor John Spencer, has canceled her upcoming events with barely three weeks left before the Sept. 12 election, her spokesman William O'Reilly said.<br />
<br />"This past Saturday, my 16-year-old daughter, Camilla, was caught shoplifting from two stores in Suffolk County," McFarland said in a statement. Her daughter will not contest the charges, two counts each of petty theft and possession of stolen goods, McFarland said.<br />
<br />Further details on the arrest were not immediately available.<br />
<br />"My husband Alan and I are deeply alarmed by this incident and will be spending every waking hour in the coming days dealing head-on with the repercussions of her actions," she said. "I will resume active campaigning only when I am certain that my daughter is OK and getting the help she needs."</blockquote>They are dropping like aphids in a cloud of DDT.  <br />
<br />I don't know if this means Hillary is benefitting from black magic or divine intervention, but it sure seems like somebody is clearing the path for her.</div>
