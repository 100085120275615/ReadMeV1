<span>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton on Wednesday accused Republicans of "playing the fear card" of terrorism to win elections and said Democrats cannot keep quiet if they want to win in November. "I take a back seat to nobody when it comes to fighting terrorism and standing up for national homeland security," she said.

She added, "Since when has it been part of American patriotism to keep our mouths shut?" GIRLFRIEND! WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?</span>
