<span><strong>MLW Returns</strong></span><br /><span><span><strong>MLW </strong>suffered from a little political overload the last few weeks. Between not having personal experiences to share and feeling overwhelmed by the absolute crap theatre that is our political process, I was stymied in my writing attempts. But I read an interview with Barack Obama last night and I thought that regardless of the results of this election, I am optimistic. Because we are engaged. People have not talked politics like this in a long time. When voters are actually engaged, throw out the polls cause who knows how it's all gonna turn out. Let's dig in...</span></span><br /><span><strong></strong></span><br /><span><span><strong>The Debates</strong></span><br /><span><span>Yes,Yes, Yes, Kerry won but he could have done better. Bush just kept repeating the same empty and meaningless slogans. I thought maybe he was having a flashback to his Yale cheerleading days. <em>"Gimme an H! Gimme an A! Gimme an R! Gimme a D! What's it spell? </em></span><span><em>Hard!'</em>- No shit George, lots of jobs require hard work, you've just never had one before. </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>I thought some of the questions were stupid, too. Bob Schieffer's shallow pandering to women with the "We've surrounded ourselves by strong women..." Why are we measuring candidates by their spouses? Frankly, I'd like to hear more substantive talk about a REAL ISSUE than an camera-ready phony display of their "humanness." Also annoying, Gwen Ifills inane question that instructed, "..without saying the candidate's name..." Are we in 5th grade? </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span>Random thoughts -it's interesting that it's okay for a Republican - in this case, Alan Keyes - (running futilely or is that <strong><em>facile-ly</em></strong> in juntaspeak for an Illinois Senate seat-against Barack Obama) to call Mary Cheney a "selfish hedonist" but not okay for Kerry to refer to her as, ohmygod, <em>a lesbian</em>. It's only a bad thing if you think being a lesbian is bad. Yea, Lynn Cheney, I'm talking to you, girlfriend. </span><br /><span></span></span><br /><span>and<br /></span><br /><span><span>I want to know why Edwards didn't respond when Dick-I-had-other-priorities-Cheney said they had not met. I wanted to jump up at slap his smug, arrogant white corporate mercenary ass on my 13" TV.</span> </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>and</span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span>Since when are trial lawyers to blame for health care costs in America? I can't wait to see Michael Moore rip on the pharma companies.<br /></span><span></span><br /><span><strong>More White Corporate Asses</strong></span><br /><span><span><strong>MLW</strong></span> attended an"Election Outlook" presentation at her day job last week. What I assumed would be an interesting discussion quickly transformed into a thinly-veiled junta commercial. I have to give kudos to our lobbyist who facilitated the session. As a former Newt Gingrich staff member, you can imagine the non-partisan nature of his comments. There was a junta power spill all over his power point deck. He began his comments with the completely objective opinion that "In 2005, the focus will return to domestic issues." Hmmm..Last I knew the junta's occupation of Iraq had racked 120 billion from the police state's treasury. So it's just going to end in January 2005? Amazing how these silly little wars just disappear!</span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>I have to hand it to his white corporate ass (WCA), he was very subtle in his propagation of the junta agenda. Let me give you another example. He brought up taxes and assured us that Senator Kerry would not only be raising individual taxes but he would start taxing our very company for all the outsourcing it sponsors. Bad, bad liberal! Making corporations pay for sending their work overseas for cheaper wages, cheaper benefits, and tax loopholes! He also mentioned the privatization of Social Security and how that would benefit the financial advisors group in our firm. My question - what happened to being good businessmen and good citizens? He also mentioned 527 groups but only the ones that support Kerry. No Swift Boat Veterans (who weren't actually there) for Truth (Lies) going on in this "discussion."</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>And yes I know I'm a white corporate ass, too. But this ass is also liberal. </span><br /><span></span><br /><span><span><strong>And You Thought Your Family Was Dsyfunctional</strong></span><br /><span>Check out this website I just found through ABC News Online, <em>The Note</em> </span></span><a href="http://www.bushrelativesforkerry.com"><span>www.bushrelativesforkerry.com</span></a><span><span>.

My Christian faith is not looking for a new Messiah named George Bush. I am, however, looking for a leader.

Sinclair is the largest television station firm in the U.S., whose executives have given thousands of dollars to the junta campaign.</span></span><br /><span><span></span></span><br /><span><span>Today's New York Times reports, "<em>The company, already suffering from a sluggish advertising climate, has had its stock price fall by almost 17 percent and its market capitalization drop by $140 million in the last week and a half. The protest grew yesterday. The <strong>Burger King</strong> Company announced that it would pull all its commercials from Sinclair stations all day on the date the program is broadcast. "Burger King wants to maintain neutrality during this election," said Eric Anderson, a spokesman.</em></span></span><br /><span><span></span></span><br /><span><span>Doesn't some British congolmerate own Burger King? Can you imagine if someone forced stations to air "Fahreheit 9/11" - there'd be a massive government takeover of television. </span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Direct from the Sinclair website, read this from the CEO, David-white- corporate-ass-whiner-Smith.</span></span><br /><span><span> </span></span><br /><span><span> <span><em>"The experience of preparing to air this  news special has been trying for many of those involved.  The  company  and  many of  its executives have endured personal attacks of  the  vilest  nature,  as well as calls on our advertisers and our viewers to boycott our stations and  shareholders to sell their stock.  (<strong><span>MLW: the First Amendment in badass ction</span></strong>.) In  addition, and more shockingly, we have  received  threats  of  retribution  from a member of Senator John Kerry's campaign and have seen attempts by leading  members  of Congress to influence  (<strong><span>MLW:</span><span> as is their duty as Congress</span></strong>) the  Federal  Communications  Commission to  stop Sinclair from broadcasting this news special.  Moreover,  these  coordinated attacks have occurred without regard to the facts since  they  predated the broadcast of our news special. We cannot in a  free  America  yield to the misguided attempts by a small but vocal minority to influence  behavior and trample on the First Amendment rights of those  with whom they might not agree... We also took  comfort  in the positions of other media organizations  which  supported our right  topresent this story notwithstanding any disagreement they may have  with  thec ontent, (<strong><span>MLW</span></strong><strong><span>: this can only be Fox News</span></strong>) as well as in the words of Michael Powell, Chairman of the FCC</em>  <em><strong><span>(MLW: nominated by Clinton for a Republican seat on the FCC, designated by Bush as chairman. One job on his resume, former policy advisor to Dick-I-have-other-priorities-Cheney)</span></strong> who refused to block  the  program,  noting that to do so would  be 'unconstitutional' and 'an absolute disservice to the First Amendment.'"</em></span></span></span><br /><p><span>If it was such a small minority why did they change their policy?  If they really think they are right, why are they backing down? I'm not sure how forcing your TV stations to interrupt regular broadcasting for a anti-Kerry documentary constitutes employing your First Amendment rights while  choosing to boycott your advertisers <strong>does not</strong>. No wonder their stock price has gone down- they aren't very smart guys! I think that just ought to show "Going Upriver" and then they'll prove how non-partisan they are and everybody is happy!</span></p><p><span><strong><span>Shout Out to a Stranger</span></strong><br /><span><strong>Bush Slam Poetry Winner - Rated PG</strong></span><br /><span>If an f-bomb or two offends you (and it's the only kind of bomb I like), skip this section.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>I am acknowledging a complete stranger here- Vanessa German who was awarded First Place in in the Bush Slam.
