<p>As I point out in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595550518/sr=8-1/qid=1156591034/ref=sr_1_1/103-9518918-8689448?ie=UTF8"><strong>In Defense of the Religious Right</strong></a>, on the eve of the 2004 election, an election dominated by âmoral valuesâ voters (despite what some have <a href="http://www.johntabin.com/archives/000926.html"><strong>written</strong></a>), fully 42% of Americans saw the Democrat Party as âfriendly toward religion.â</p>
<p>Of course, the Dems got walloped in 2004, largely because they were so remarkably out-of-step with the values of those âvalues votersâ.  The Dems then embarked on a remarkable propaganda campaign designed to <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w050418&#038;s=sullivan042005"><strong>âtake back the faithâ</strong></a> from religious conservatives.  This effort was led by people like Howard Dean, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, and â¦ well, you get the picture.  </p>
<p>The campaign was a flop.  One year later, after all this posturing, the percentage of Americans who viewed the Dems as âreligion friendlyâ plummeted to 29%.</p>
<p>Another campaign seemed to pick up; this one more serious.  Genuine liberal Christians like Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo took the reigns of the religious left movement from out of the hands of the blowhard politicians.  As Steve Waldman <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2139365/"><strong>has written</strong></a> in <em>Slate</em>, âA week doesn&#8217;t seem to pass without some group convening a conference on religion and liberalism.â</p>
<p>â¦ And the percentage of Americans who viewed the Dems as a âreligion friendlyâ party fell again!  <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/015111.php"><strong>This time to 26%</strong></a>.  According to the Pew Forum on Religion &#038; Public Life, even a majority of <em>Democrats</em> view themselves as unfriendly toward religion.  More moderate/conservative Democrats believe liberals have âgone too farâ keeping religion out of government (70%) than believe conservatives have âgone too far imposing their religious values (51%).â  </p>
<p>Yet another propaganda campaign <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14484312/"><strong>seems to be heating up</strong></a>.  Expect the percentage of Americans who view the Democrats as &#8220;religion friendly&#8221; to tumble again next year.</p>
<p>So that we are clear: the Democrats cannot win back the House or Senate this year with these numbers.  I mean, I know âmoral values votersâ are a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A44082-2004Nov11.html"><strong>myth</strong></a> and everything, but still â¦</p>
<p>You can read the Pew survey <a href="http://pewforum.org/docs/index.php?DocID=153#2"><strong>here</strong></a>.  I will have much, much more on the subject in future posts.
