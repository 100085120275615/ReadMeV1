<div>We hear it all of the time, "The Republicans are trying to Shred the Constitution.  They are trying to undermine the democratic process.  They want to disenfranchise voters.  They are making desperate power grads."  This is the new mantra of the Left.  Gray Davis, Cruz Bustamnate, Bill Clinton, Tom Daschle, Texas Democrats, and The Despicable Dozen (the ten Democratic Presidential Candidates, Hillary and Gore) are all regurgitating the same talking points.  I even heard it on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  It is a classic example of projection.  The Left accuses the Right of trying to destroy democracy all the while they are ripping at its seams.
<br />
<br />	The Left claims that the Republicans were grasping for power during the Clinton Impeachment.  I got news folks; Gore would have become President if Clinton were removed from office.  It suffices to say that Gore is hardly a Republican!  When Nixon was nearly impeached, the Democrats just wanted to "know the facts."  When Clinton was impeached, for lying under oath to congress and various courts not for having sexual relations with an intern, the Democrats portrayed the Republicans as desperate power grabbers.  The Republicans were following the Constitution.  The Democrats in the Senate are complicit in the perjury (a high crime) and obstruction of justice (a misdemeanor) of Bill Clinton.  But, it is the Republicans destroying the Constitution?
<br />
<br />	Democrats constantly bring up the 2000 election.  They say, "Bush was selected, not elected."  It was another Republican power grab!  Gore was the one who brought it to court.  He asked for recounts only in four select heavily Democrat counties.  He tried to have thousands of Military Absentee Ballots tossed out.  He asked the Florida Supreme Court to rewrite election laws and tell different counties to count their ballots differently.  All the while Bush was just asking that the overwhelmingly Democratic County Election Officials certify the election, according to the existing election laws.  But, it is the Republicans destroying the Constitution?
<br />
<br />	Lets look at another story that got overshadowed by the by the Florida Fiasco.  Shortly before the election the plane of Missouri's Governor, Mel Carnahan, crashed, killing the Senate candidate.  John Ashcroft, who was ahead in the polls at the time, suspended his campaign.  He was not going to capitalize on the death of his opponent.  Carnahan's widow and successor certainly had no problem exploiting his death.  Roger Wilson, Missouri's new Governor announced that if Mel Carnahan won the election that he would appoint Jean Carnahan, Mel's widow, to the Senate.  Jean continued top campaign, bringing up the memory of her dead husband for her own personal gain.  When exit polls showed Ashcroft with a lead labor leaders, presumably Democratic operatives, asked a Federal Judge to hold open polls in only the most Democratic St. Louis precincts hours past closing time.  Democrats got on the phone, drove voters to the polls did what they had to do to get out the vote.  Jean, or should I say Mel, eventually won.  John Ashcroft could have contested the election in court.  Missouri's election laws state that you must be an inhabitant of the state at the time of the election in order to appear on the ballot.  Unless you count being buried in a cemetery as being an inhabitant, Mel Carnahan's vote should not have been counted.  John Ashcroft would have been the winner.  Did he make a desperate grab for power?  But, it is the Republicans destroying the Constitution?
<br />
<br />	Despite all the Democrats, efforts to gain control of the Senate through elections the failed.  But, they did gain control of the Senate by upsetting the will of the people and disenfranchising thousands of voters.  The Republican voters of Vermont elected Jim Jeffords.  When he switched parties months into a six-year term, he disenfranchised all of his supporters.  Tom Daschle, one of the most vocal accusers of the Republicans, made a power grab for the Majority Leadership.  But, it is the Republicans destroying the Constitution?
<br />
<br />	Less than two year later, in an effort to keep control of the Senate, the Democrats made yet another power grab.  New Jersey Senator Robert Torrecelli, in the middle of a bribery scandal and desperately behind in the polls, dropped out of the Senate race.  That is fine, but it was thirty-four days before the election.  New Jersey law states that there can be no ballot changes fifty-one days before an election.  The Democrats did not care; they went to the New Jersey Supreme Court and asked that Frank Lautenberg's name be placed on the ballot.  Again, they disenfranchised millions of voters by removing the primary election winner and replacing him with a man for which no one voted.  They disregarded the laws and placed a name on the ballot after the legislated deadline.  But, it is the Republicans destroying the Constitution?
<br />
<br />	Last May, Governor Rick Perry of Texas called a special election to consider constitutionally mandated redistricting.  Texas is overwhelmingly Republican, but for some reason their congressional delegation is not.  The Republicans redrew the Congressional Districts in a way that will more accurately represent the people of Texas.  The Democrats could not tolerate that!  In May, nearly fifty Texas State House Representatives violated the law and fled to Oklahoma in an effort to prevent that House from establishing a quorum.  Eventually, Governor Perry gave up and suspended the special session.  Again, in September Governor Perry called another special session.  This time it was Ten State Senators who violated the law and fled to Albuquerque, New Mexico.  But, it is the Republicans destroying the Constitution?
<br />
<br />	Caught up in all of the California Recall excitement the Democrats formed a group calling for the recall of President Bush.  The group led by Joe Lockhart, President Clinton's former Press Secretary, and Mike Lux, a Democratic Political Consultant, believes that President Bush should be recalled even though the Constitution does not provide for recalling elected officials.  Democrats call the Davis recall an attempt to destroy the democratic process, even though it is provided for in the California Constitution.  They call it obscure, and that the Republicans are power grabbing, but it has been tried more that thirty times.  The Democrats have tried four times to recall Reagan and five times to recall Wilson.  But, it is the Republicans destroying the Constitution?
<br />
<br />	The Democrats are always shouting, like Chicken Little, that the sky is falling.  They accuse the Republicans of destroying the democratic process.  They accuse the Republicans of disenfranchising voter.  They accuse the Republicans of shredding the Constitution.  While yelling as loud as they can the Democrats are themselves destroying the democratic process, disenfranchising voters, and shredding the Constitution.  But, it is the Republicans destroying the Constitution?
