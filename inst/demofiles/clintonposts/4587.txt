<p>I've been reading Newsweek's Conventional Wisdom for a decade. Yes -- because I like being tortured. And I'm always amazed how each weekly edition could've been written by the DNC's top political strategists. I mean -- it's just spot on the Democrat's message. Of course, so is the weekly's cover image.</p>

<p>That would be bad enough, but for the first time ever, I noticed that CW comes with a disclaimer: Conventional Wisdom <b>"is not NEWSWEEK's opinion, but an informal distillation of the ever-changing thinking of Beltway pundits and the chattering classes."</b> And they say incest only happens in the Appalachian Mountains.</p>
        <p><b>Not Really Beach Reading Edition</b><br />
<i>Israelis are entitled to defend themselves against Hizbullah terrorists, but anyone can see this plan just ain't working.</i></p>

<p>See if you can guess <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14207035/site/newsweek/">who's up and who's down</a>:</p>

<p><b>Bush:</b> Mideast policy's a flop, his generals say we're losing and now he's in Crawford. Come home and fix things.</p>

<p><b>Rumsfeld:</b> Even calibrating Hillary now says he should take a hike. Why the dickens is he still on this job?<br />
Cong. </p>

<p><b>GOPs:</b> Typical election-year scam: Crumbs for the workers, but only if super-rich get billions. Not this time, fellas.</p>

<p><b>Lieberman:</b> Joe-mentum is rolling--in the wrong direction. And he won't win as an indie, either. Graceful exit, please.</p>

<p><b>M. Gibson:</b> Will police video be "Mad Max" meets "Protocols of Elders of Zion"? Another cross for Mel to bear.</p>

<p><b>W. Ferrell:</b> "Talladega Nights" is boffo hit and ultimate ad vehicle. This arrow brought to you by Wonder Bread.</p>
