<br />You know, I've been getting around to writing a nice big, long, juicy, well thought out, well written serious piece on Canada-US relations and "anti-Americanism" that is free of spelling errors. Since it seems that that is not going to happen in the near future, we'll just have to settle for this, as I settle down next to the computer with my beer and popcorn (All right, the election has been over for months, I'll cut out the Scott Reid jokes)...<br />
<br />Canada-US relations are a pretty big issue. And, at least since Bush took power (note how I didn't say elected), it is an issue that has been hijacked by the neocon conseravtives and their lapdog media allies (Yes, I know Harper hates the media, but seeing as how they were complicit in Harper's big lie, I count them on his side). Instead of "how can we preserve Canadian sovereignty when we are so close," it has become an issue of "how can we best become Dubya's b!tch."<br />
<br />Now, there are a plethora (damn, I hope I used that word right) of cross border issues that affect us as Canadians. Passports at the border, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/mercerreport/video_player.html?softwood">softwood lumber</a>, missile defence, NAFTA, which wars we go to, regional issues such as Devil's Lake...these all come to mind. Now, as Canadians, we tend to want to make up our minds ourselves. Our decisions should be made in Ottawa, not Washington. And we want what we are entitled to, such as the softwood lumber issue, where "binding" hearings have ruled in our favour countless times, yet we keep going back.<br />
<br />Now, these issues are compunded by the conservatives, and that dreadful label, "anti-American." No one wants to be called anti-American, and politicians routinely suffer for it. Take a look at the last election, in which the Liberals were called anti-American. What did they do to deserve the label? Okay, they've got Carolyn Parrish, but she got the boot for <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/22minutes/22_single_player.html?archive/carolyn_parrish">performing voodoo on a George W. Bush doll</a> (hey, it was fun, and he deserves it). Besides, Tucker Carlson and Pat Robertson more than cancel her out. But apart from that, there wasn't much. I mean, they said "we want what we are entitled to" on softwood lumber, they made the decision to not participate in the illegal invasion of Iraq (I wasn't aware that making a decision on whether to go to war or not was anti-American), chose not to participate in the missile defence scheme, and were just too different from Bush. But Harper and his media allies brought out the knives, and suddenly you aren't allowed to say that.  How dare they disagree with Washington.  Incidentally, Harper was also called anti-American after he was elected.  Why?  He wanted to build a naval base in the Arctic Ocean to defend our soverignty, disagreeing with Washington.  Damn, first they want us to build a stronger military, then when Harper says he wants to build a new base, they get pissed.  You just can't please these people...<br />
<br />The anti-American label is a plague on Canadian politics. Instead of promoting debate, it stifles it by putting limits on what can be expressed. And the inability to express opinions that differ from Washington's can only lead to a 51st (okay, maybe 51st through 63rd) state. Incidentally, I don't see American politicians (usually right-wing idiots like Carlson and Robertson, but occasionally Hillary) being dubbed "anti-Canadian" (okay, maybe the ambassador is called a dick, but perhaps you should nominate one that doesn't lecture us whenever we disagree with you) when they disagree with Ottawa, and suffering for it at the polls.  I can't think of one American politican who has been harmed by an anti-Canadian label.<br />
<br />This tactic of labelling people as "anti-American" to score cheap political points is doing much more harm to Canada than calling the chimp a chimp ever will. It is ensuring that we will become a 51st state, for whenever an opinion that isn't Washington's becomes outside the bounds of the expressible, we are no longer an independent country, we are an American colony.<br />
<br />However, you can't convince the right of this. Perhaps they just want to remake Canada in George Bush's image, or perhaps they are just pissed over being wrong about the Iraq war. Or, perhaps the right, which loves to bash Canada and Canadians to the left of chimpie for being "insecure" whenever we do something that chimpie disagrees with, are insecure themselves. They wish they lived south of the 49th, because Canadians reject everything they stand for:  the gutting of social programs, participating in American acts of aggression, and reversing the multicultural policies that have given Canada a reputation as a tolerant society.  The right doesn't want the true north strong and free, they want Dubya's b!tch.  They are perfectly content to have Canada as an American colony, to have policy set by Washington, because they prefer the "natural governing party" of the United States to the "natural governing party" of Canada.<br />
<br />So, am I anti-American?  Well, it depends what you mean.  Do I hate all Americans?  Of course not.  But, I know what I believe, and I know the truth about American imperialist adventures, the subversion of democracy, and horrible human rights abuses in Chile, Venezuela, Guatemala, Haiti...etc.  I'm anti-imperialist, anti-oppression, anti-capitalist and anti-racism, which makes me opposed to pretty much everything the current administration stands for.  If you want to call me anti-American, go ahead, I won't lose any sleep over it.</div>
