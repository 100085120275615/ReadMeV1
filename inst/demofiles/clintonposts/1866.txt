<span>China has been engaged in a huge military build-up. </span>
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/05/24/pentagon.china.ap/index.html?section=cnn_latest">Now they're mad at the US</a>
<span> for calling it an "offensive" move:</span>
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>
<span>BEIJING, China (AP) -- China has angrily rejected a U.S. Defense Department report that says Beijing is a potential military threat, insisting that its multibillion-dollar buildup is defensive.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>Beijing is "strongly resentful of and firmly opposed to" the comments in an annual Pentagon report on Chinese military power, state media quoted Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Jianchao as saying.</span>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course. It's <span>defensive</span>. Because China has been under lots of military threats lately from...whom?</p>
<span>Remember the 80s? When the Soviet Union called their military buildup "defensive"?</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>This has nothing to do with "defense" and everything to do with tiny, democratic Taiwan.</span>
<br />

<span>Meanwhile, Al Gore is back on the scene! (Speaking of failed politicians who fell off the media radar, what happened to Tom Daschle? But I digress.) He's put out that new movie on global warming that everyone's talking about. Except that he gets off topic a lot in the middle of it and talks about himself:</span>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span>On NBC's "Today" show this week, Gore refused to say "never" to seeking office again, and this movie looks like a vehicle for another presidential run. It shows snippets from the 2000 election, as if keeping Gore out of the White House was a catastrophe for our electoral system. </span>
</p> <p>
<span>Gore also pulls out all the emotional stops in this global warming movie. He recounts his son's auto accident, his sister's death from lung cancer and his family's hand-wringing over its tobacco farm.</span>
</p>

<p>
<span>Ah yes, because these things have so much to do with global warming, the professed topic of the movie. This film is one big piece of campaign propaganda - he's floating his persona in the public eye now to see how Americans respond to the idea of him reentering national politics.</span>
</p>
<p>
<span>I say: go for it, Al! Remind Americans about how you invented the internet. Any competition to Hillary for the nomination is good, and there is a <span>lot </span>of feeling that "anyone but Hillary" is a good nominee. The field of Democratic candidates for the nomination is going to get thick by the time '08 rolls around and it's going to be <span>very </span>interesting to watch.</span>
