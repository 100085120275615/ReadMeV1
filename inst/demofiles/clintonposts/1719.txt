<br />Nope, .I really don't see a pattern here to
<br />justify profiling, do you?
<br />
<br />So, to ensure we Americans never offend anyone,
<br />particularly fanatics intent on killing us, airport
<br />security screeners will no longer be allowed
<br />to profile certain people. They must conduct random
<br />searches of 80-year-old women, little kids,
<br />airline pilots with proper identification, secret
<br />agents who are members of the President's security
<br />detail, 85-year old Congressmen with metal hips,
<br />and Medal of Honor winning and former Governor Joe Foss,
<br />but leave Muslim Males between the ages 17 and
<br />40 alone because of profiling.
<br />
<br />Let's send this to as many people as we can so that
<br />the Gloria Aldreds and other dunder-headed attorneys
<br />along with FederalJustices that want
<br />to thwart common sense, feel doubly ashamed of
<br />themselves - if they have any such sense.
<br />
<br />As the writer of the award winning story "Forrest
<br />Gump" so aptly put it, "Stupid is as stupid does."
