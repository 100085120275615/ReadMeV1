<div>People's political affiliations are interesting to me. It can say alot about one's true values--usually on an unconscious level. In fact, what someone <em>does not </em>stand for is often more revealing than what they do stand for.
<br />
<br />One thing, however, that has never made sense to me in the present American political scene is the noble claim of being one of the "undecided." It is among these chosen few who get to pose questions to President Bush and Senator Kerry in the proposed town-hall debate forum. However, given the issues that face American society and their pressing importance for the civil life of our nation, I am not sure which is more astonishing--the fact that individuals can actually claim to be undecided, or the level of insight (and deference) that politicians and the media lavish upon them.
<br />
<br />Ignorance, lack of a coherent political philosophy, and sheer apathy are a far cry from civil virtue and responsibility. Come on undecides--show a little spine and common sense!
<br />
<br />Speaking of the undecided, it appears that Senator Kerry, with the aid of the Clinton "A-team," has finally found his voice. I was truly beginning to wonder what direction he was going to take to self-destruction as the clock ticks down in this election. The primaries were surely tough for him, with the Dean-inflicted need to morph his Senate record of support for military action in Iraq into something that would make Michael Moore and the fever swamp crowd pleased. But he got through it and seemed well on his way to trying to become--well, whatever it is he had to become to convince an electoral majority of Americans to vote for him.
<br />
<br />I distinctly remember the first signs of transformation months ago while reading <em>Rolling Stones </em>magazine in an auto tire service center waiting room. In the middle of an interview (yes, <em>Rolling Stones</em>), Kerry ratcheted up his rhetoric with the words "Yes, I voted for Bush to use military action in Iraq, but how was I supposed to know that he would f-ck it up so badly!" Ahhhh, the young vote . . . .
<br />
<br />Anyway, this new voice of Kerry's seems to go something like this: "Bush is bad, bad, bad . . . and I am good. The present difficulties in Iraq are proof." Hmmm.
<br />
<br />Former Clinton-handler-turned-moderate <a href="http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/19597.htm">Dick Morris</a> believes that this final flip may be one flop too many for Kerry, as this move merely serves to inspire those who selected him over Howard Dean. Morris writes, "Liberals will cheer Kerry's new-found decisiveness, but it opens the way for Bush to deal him a counterstroke that can all but end this election and finish off Kerry for good."
<br />
<br />One can surely hope.
