<p>Here&#8217;s a topic that I am sure will create some debate on this Sunday morning.  The Washington Post Magazine has a long article on whether John McCain is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/23/AR2006082301586.html">&#8220;Heir Apparent&#8221;</a> of President Bush.<br />
<blockquote>DON&#8217;T LOOK NOW, but 26 months before November 2008 the race for president has already started. McCain and his potential rivals are out on the campaign trail virtually every week. They are raising money and support for federal and state candidates in the 2006 election. But they are also collecting chits, building name recognition and garnering backers for the presidential campaign to come.</p>
<p>&#8220;Teddy White must be turning over in his grave,&#8221; says John Weaver, McCain&#8217;s chief campaign strategist, referring to the late author of The Making of the President books. &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe we&#8217;re doing this so early.&#8221;</p>
<p>But doing it they are. And no one more assiduously, nor with more apparent success, than McCain, who has vaulted to the front of the GOP field. Early polls indicate he gets twice as much support as any other likely Republican candidate except Rudy Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City, who runs close behind. Even in liberal, blue-state strongholds such as Massachusetts, McCain runs even with or better than the two most recognizable Democratic names, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore. As a former Navy pilot who was shot down over Hanoi and spent more than five years as a prisoner of war, he&#8217;s got impeccable military credentials and stature, and a reputation for bipartisanship and fierce independence that appeals to a broad spectrum of voters. He&#8217;s also got star power: Turn on your television most days, and you&#8217;ll find McCain on one of the morning talkfests or on &#8220;Larry King Live,&#8221; &#8220;Imus&#8221; or &#8220;Hannity and Colmes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many of the Republican professionals who once wrote off McCain as the loosest of political cannons say they are surprised and impressed at the careful, disciplined way he and his staff have gone about establishing his as yet undeclared candidacy. <strong>He is laboring hard to become the presumptive candidate for a party that almost always nominates the presumptive candidate.</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s very much where George W. Bush was in 1998 and &#8216;99 &#8212; getting his team established, <strong>trying to create that same air of inevitability that Karl Rove tried to create around Bush</strong>,&#8221; says Saul Anuzis, chairman of Michigan&#8217;s Republican Party, referring to Bush&#8217;s political Rasputin.</p></blockquote>
<p>I recommend reading the entire article <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/23/AR2006082301586.html">here</a>.  It is hard to argue with the premise about Republicans picking the presumptive candidate on a regular basis, which the article points out that McCain is trying to do.  The last time they came close to nominating someone other than the presumptive nominee was Ronald Reagan in 1976.  Since then, every Republican nominee for President eventually chosen in the primaries was probably the favorite before the primary season, even if they had some hiccups along the way&#8230;Reagan, Reagan, Bush 41, Dole, Bush 43, Bush 43.  It is the Democrats that normally have the free-for-alls for the Presidential nomination in recent years.
