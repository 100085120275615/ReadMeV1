<div>Has anyone noticed just how much the situation faced by Joe Lieberman today in Connecticut resembles that endured by Arlen Specter in Pennsylvania just two years ago?<br />
<br />In both cases Senators who stood apart from their party's self-designated "base" on major issues faced important challenges from ideological zealots [Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania, Ned Lamont in Connecticut] that threatened to unseat them in the party primaries.<br />
<br />The point here is that both major parties are afflicted by ideological constituencies that try to force them into a narrowly defined set of principles and programs, who seek to squelch internal debate and moderate sentiment, and who are powerfully energized, have effective means to communicate their messages, and who are very well funded.<br />
<br />One of the great glories of the American political system has been the fact that neither of the two major parties was particularly ideological in nature. Both were what used to be called "umbrella parties" comprehending many diverse elements and interests. Sure there were ideological parties, but they were always located on the fringes and, while potentially important at the local level, were unlikely to have much effect on the outcome of state and national elections. The effect was to stabilize the winner-take-all national political system by ensuring that ideologically committed groups would have to compromise with other interests within the existing party institutions if they hoped to avoid complete marginalization.<br />
<br />Now, however, that system seems to be breaking down as highly committed ideologues are on the verge of having a serious impact on the major parties. For a moderate like me nothing could be more chilling than to hear Hillary Clinton call for Don Rumsfeld's resignation because that signalled that one of the most canny political figures at the national level, one whose husband famously took on extremist elements of the party in his Sister Souljah moment, had been force to bow to the tide of extremism flowing from the left.<br />
<br />Pundits are now wondering whether or not the Democratic Party can be saved. The bigger question is whether or not the two party system can survive the well funded, technologically sophisticated assaults from both the left and the right.<br />
<br />These are trying and troublesome days. The worst of both parties are filled with passionate intensity. Because, unlike the parliamentary systems of Europe, winners in American politics take all, the threat that ideological elements might take control in either major party, or  perhaps both,  is a matter of great concern.<br />
<br />In Pennsylvania the Party elites, including Sen. Santorum and the White House, united with Sen. Specter to successfully turn back the tide of radicalism. Recent weeks have seen a parade of prominent Democrats, including former President Bill Clinton, rally to Sen. Lieberman's defense. Let us hope that the Democrat efforts to stem the tide of radicalism will be as effective as those of the Republicans two years ago.<br />
<br />Lord save us from the politics of principle.<br />
<br />I think it is appropriate to note that al-Qaeda is Arabic for "the base."<br />
<br />UPDATE:<br />
<br />Well, it's over and Lamont won, barely. Lieberman conceded, denounced the politics of hate, and promised to continue the fight as an independent. Now a lot depends on the Democrat establishment -- how strongly will they support Lamont? I expect a closing of ranks around Lamont, some really, really nasty escalating attacks on Joe, and a determined effort to drive him out of the race. <br />
<br />Stay tuned....</div>
