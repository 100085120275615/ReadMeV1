<p><em>I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t resist posting this little twist on a traditional story that I got in one of those emails that came from so-and-so who got it from somebody else, and on and on down a long convoluted email chain.  So, apologies to the originator for not being able to give you the credit.  Anyway, I&#8217;d like to know if I&#8217;m the only one who doesn&#8217;t think this is very far from the truth&#8230;</em></p>
<p><strong>Traditional Version:</strong><br />
 The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he&#8217;s a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.<br />
Moral of the Story: Be responsible for yourself !</p>
<p><strong>Modern Version:</strong><br />
The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.  The grasshopper thinks he&#8217;s a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.</p>
<p>Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.  CBS, NBC, and ABC &#038; Cable show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food.  America is stunned by the sharp contrast. How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?</p>
<p>Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when they sing, &#8220;It&#8217;s Not Easy Being Green.&#8221;  Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant&#8217;s house where the news stations film the group singing, &#8220;We shall overcome.&#8221; Jesse then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper&#8217;s sake. Tom Daschle and John Kerry exclaim in an interview with Peter Jennings that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his &#8220;fair share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Finally, the EEOC drafts the &#8220;Economic Equity and Anti-Grasshopper Act,&#8221; retroactive to the beginning of summer. The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.</p>
<p>Hillary gets her old law firm to represent the grasshopper in a defamation suit against the ant, and the case is tried before a panel of federal judges that Bill appointed from a list of single-parent welfare recipients. The ant loses the case.</p>
<p>The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant&#8217;s food while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the ant&#8217;s old house, crumbles around him because he doesn&#8217;t maintain it.</p>
<p>The ant has disappeared in the snow.</p>
<p>The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood.</p>
