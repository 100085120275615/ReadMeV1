</a> MSNBC's  newest entry in the weekend political news / talk landscape, "Meet Depress", premiered today with Democratic Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid at the helm. "He's a perfect host", a network executive told us. "The man hasn't smiled in years. If there is a negative side to a story, you can bet Harry Reid will find it." Reid opened the show complaining about the 5am time slot citing most people are not awake at that hour  and  then opened the phone lines to the public for reaction. After several uneasy minutes, Reid fielded a call from what he thought was a viewer. The caller turned out to be Ted Kennedy jr., who was supposed to be Reid's first guest. Kennedy claimed he was running behind due to a "late" vote in the house and was being detained by Capitol Police for accidentally running a police car off the road in his rush to get to the studio. Reid was quick to criticize the officers, reminding viewers that this was the second high profile incident in a  month that Capitol police unfairly targeted democrats, the first being the Cynthia McKinney hairdo incident. Future guests on "Meet Depress" include, Nancy Pelosi, Howard Dean, James Carville, Ted Sr., Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Hillary, and Mrs. Clinton. "We're following the CNN model", network executives said. "Up untill now, they've been the most depressing  show on TV, you can't argue with success."</div>
