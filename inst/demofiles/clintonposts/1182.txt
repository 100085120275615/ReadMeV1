Dems and their media mouthpieces blasted Green for relying on Bush's ability to bring in big bucks while they simultaneously claimed that it was a negative for Green to associate himself with the President, referring to them as "soul mates."<br /><br />Now, Governor Jim Doyle is getting a little help from his friends.<br /><br />Bill Clinton will be coming to Milwaukee to give Doyle a boost.</span><br /><br /><a href="http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Article=69772">Doyle's Press release</a></strong><br /><br /><blockquote>MADISON â Today, Governor Jim Doyleâs re-election campaign announced that former President Bill Clinton will campaign with the Governor in Wisconsin on October 24.<br /><br />Details of the visit were not immediately released. The President is expected to appear at a fundraiser with the Governor in Milwaukee.<br /><br />âPresident Clinton is an extraordinary leader, a great American, and a champion for middle class and working families,â said Governor Doyle. âI am honored to have his support, and delighted that he is coming to our great state. His visit will be an exciting day for Wisconsin and for my campaign.â</blockquote><br /><strong><span>Clinton's late October stump for Doyle could be the kiss of death.<br /><br />He doesn't have a good track record. For instance, he campaigned for Joe Lieberman in his primary race with Ned Lamont. That didn't help Lieberman.<br /><br />In Al Gore's FAILED 2000 presidential bid, he wanted nothing to do with ol' Bill. In the final days of Gore's campaign, Clinton did make a few appearances, but that didn't deliver the election to Gore.<br /><br />It seems that Clinton's visit is timed to give Doyle's campaign that final shot in the arm right before election day. Certainly, there are Wisconsin Dems that will be receptive to Clinton and swayed by his star power.<br /><br />It doesn't appear that fundraising is the main motive here, though Doyle could be counting on using the money he pulls in for a last minute media blitz.<br /><br />Even though Clinton is a former U.S. president, I don't think he has the clout to push undecideds into Doyle's camp.<br /><br />Clinton is an odd figure. Dems and independents have sort of a love-hate relationship with him, kind of like Hillary.<br /><br />On Wednesday, a popular, high profile Republican will be in Milwaukee to campaign for Green.</span> </strong><br /><br /><blockquote><a href="http://www.jsonline.com/watch/?watch=22&date=8/22/2006&amp;id=10291">Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani</a> will stump for Green tomorrow during a stop in Milwaukee's Sherman Park.</blockquote><br /><span><strong>Green is not surrendering the city of Milwaukee to Doyle. That's good. Every vote counts. </strong></span><br /><span><strong></strong></span><br /><span><strong>That reminds me of Donovan Riley. He likes to be counted twice. I sincerely hope that Republicans will be <em>closely</em> monitoring the polls. </strong></span><br /><span><strong></strong></span><br /><span><strong>That reminds me of Jimmy Carter, trotting off to supervise elections around the world. If a Hamas candidate was running in Wisconsin, he'd be here on election day. </strong></span><br /><span><strong></strong></span><br /><span><strong>Bill Clinton, Donovan Riley, Jimmy Carter -- Just mentioning those names is enough to make me anxious to get to the polls on November 7.</strong></span><br /><br /><br /><p><span><strong></strong></span></p><p><span><strong></strong></p></span>
