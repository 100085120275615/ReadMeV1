My mother and step father were here over
   the weekend and I come to find during their visit that not only are they <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dumbasses">republicans</a> but
   they support and LOVE that oaf of a president.Â  You know, the war mongering,
   oil profitering, conservative spender (oxy moron alert), National Guard joining-to-get-out-of-serving-in-Vietnam
   AWOL (pronounced A-HOLE) who lacks an education higher than the fifth grade!Â 
   And on top of that, my step father actually said that he's afraid if <a href="http://www.votehillary.org/">Hillary
   Clinton becomes the next president</a>.Â  Not wanting to argue, I didn't push
   the subject but WOW!Â  I don't know what to think of now.Â  
   <br /><br />
   I guess I shouldn't be too surprised, I basically knew it but I was in denial until
   I actually heard my mom say it.Â  And when I made a joke about Bush she actually
   got offended and DEFENDED the man!Â  OMG!<br /><br />
   Heh, at least they got to see the bumber sticker on my <a href="http://blog.me-nikk.com">wife's</a> car
   that reads "The only Bush I trust is my own".Â  :D<br /><br />
   $update(I forgot to add that they both currently live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida">Florida</a>.Â 
   Makes me wonder if <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeb_Bush">Jeb Bush</a> has
   put somehthing in the water... a pile of shit ought to do it.<br /><br />
   I still love you mom.)<br /><img src="http://www.xerratus.com/aggbug.ashx?id=0d296fab-7412-4bbe-b45f-2cd78a2e1217" height="0" width="0" />
