<div>As we approach the 5th year after 9/11/2001, let's hope that the media coverage will finally get around to asking some hard questions--such as why Bush was out chopping wood in the weeks before the attack. Or the questions posed here by this Raw Story piece:<br />

<br />
<br />
<span>A scientist at the Environmental Protection Agency has written a letter to Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and other members of the New York congressional delegation blasting the EPA for hiding dangerous toxins from Ground Zero workers in the aftermath of 9/11, RAW STORY has learned.<br />
<br />The letter, written by Dr. Cate Jenkins and obtained by RAW STORY, claims that EPA-funded research on the toxicity of breathable alkaline dust at the site âfalsified pH resultsâ to make the substance appear benign, when it was, in reality, corrosive enough to cause first responders and other workers in lower Manhattan to later lose pulmonary functions and, in some cases, to die.<br />
<br />Jenkins writes:<br />
<br />    "These falsifications directly contributed not only to emergency personnel and citizens not taking adequate precautions to prevent exposures, but also prevented the subsequent correct diagnosis of the causative agents responsible for the pulmonary symptoms. Thus, appropriate treatment was prevented or misdirected, and loss of life and permanent disability undoubtedly resulted."<br />
<br />Jenkins has loudly criticized the office in the past forâamong other malfeasancesâimproperly handling evidence that the World Trade Center disaster site was a major health hazard.<br />
<br />The letter, as acquired by RAW STORY, is <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/EPA_Scientest_Alleges_WTC_Fraud_0825.html">here</a>.</span>
