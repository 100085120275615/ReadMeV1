<div>The 2008 presidential election is three years away, of course, and none of these people might actually run (John Kerry=too lame; Hillary Clinton=too liberal; John McCain=too old; Rudy Giuliani=too moderate). But that doesn't stop the polling!<br />
<br />If the election were last week: <br />
<br />
<b>McCain:</b> 50%<br />
<b>Clinton:</b> 45% <br />
<br />
<b>McCain:</b> 54%<br />
<b>Kerry:</b> 41%<br />
<br />--<br />
<br />
<b>Giuliani:</b> 50%<br />
<b>Clinton:</b> 45%<br />
<br />
<b>Giuliani:</b> 54%<br />
<b>Kerry:</b> 41%<br />
<br />--<br />
<br />
<b>Get this:</b> When asked the favorable/unfavorable question, 16 percent of respondents said they'd never heard of McCain. <i>Where the eff have these people <a href="http://idolonfox.com/">been hiding</a>?</i> Nine percent said the same about Giuliani. Three percent hadn't heard of Kerry. Everyone knows Hillary, though. <br />
