<p>Dear God,</p>
	<p>I have a tongue larger than Gene Simmons&#8217;s. I&#8217;m not sure why you designed me this way. Anyways, guess who I saw on Thursday? Suzanne McCarthy. Me, Jessica, and Linda went to a show and she was there, and we were all like &#8220;eeew what a slut, let&#8217;s GLARE AT HER.&#8221; She&#8217;s such an evil flat-chested wench.</p>
	<p>There&#8217;s a God parade going down the street. It&#8217;s people in white robes and the knights of Columbus walking around town with a bell. It&#8217;s so freaking weird. They&#8217;re chanting &#8220;hail Mary.&#8221; </p>
	<p>There is now a bird trying to attack me. I&#8217;m sitting on my front lawn with a margherita, trying to write a diary entry summarizing my recent visit to Paris. While in the airport, there was a mysterious black suitcase at the gate before mine. Indians were guarding it. I didn&#8217;t spend any time being suspicious. Instead, I started singing and dancing along to Berlinda Carlisle&#8217;s &#8220;heaven is a place on earth.&#8221; It&#8217;s my happy movie ending song. I&#8217;m going to be so tan soon that I won&#8217;t stand out during Bollywood week.</p>
	<p>How long before I die? Soon, I hope. I want to haunt people. Not anything creepy. I just want to like, go to a blind man&#8217;s house and shift everything slightly to the right. </p>
	<p>I&#8217;ve been watching the cooking channel a lot so I can learn how to cook, and the history channel so I can pretend to be intellectual. Did you know that the original urban American society was actually the Irish? And they say TV is rotting our brains. </p>
	<p>I wish I could find an isolated beach somewhere. If I was in love, I imagine that to be the only place I&#8217;d want to spend it with someone. What a depressing thought. On a more cheerful note, I can roller blade backwards&#8230; but not on skates. I&#8217;m learning though. </p>
	<p>Well now I can&#8217;t really change my train of thought. I&#8217;m thinking about love and my failed marriage. I try to comfort myself by being reminded of the fact that he&#8217;s at least not abusive, you know? Lucky for me, no one in my life is abusive. I was only slapped once in my life by my mom when i was 10 because I mispronounced the country &#8216;Niger&#8217; while I was doing my geography homework.</p>
	<p>My mom told me when I was 8 that I couldn&#8217;t have a 2 piece swimsuit like the girl across the street because I was fat.</p>
	<p>Dancing keeps me slim. I know a step by step dance to Snow&#8217;s &#8220;Informer.&#8221; I taught Bill and Chelsea some moves, but they&#8217;re hardly as impressive as I am. I belong in a video clip. </p>
	<p>Keeping a good diet also helps. We had lobster for dinner tonight. I told our chef, &#8220;do you think I should apply nail varnish to the lobster&#8217;s toenails?&#8221; Aren&#8217;t I hilarious? They don&#8217;t call me Hillary for nothing.</p>
	<p>I should get going now. I&#8217;m going to get a six pack to reward myself for cleaning tonight, even though I haven&#8217;t done it yet.</p>
	<p>Yours,<br />
Hillary
