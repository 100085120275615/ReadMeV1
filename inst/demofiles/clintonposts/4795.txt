<p>The liberal group, <a href="http://home.ourfuture.org/tba06/">Take Back America</a> made a deal with another liberal group, <a href="http://www.codepink4peace.org/">Code Pink</a>. <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0613-33.htm">Code Pink got shafted</a> when Take Back America decided they didn&#8217;t want to uphold their end of a deal. Needless to say, Code Pink is a little upset.  </p>
<p>The question is&#8230; Did Hillary know? What did she know? And when did she know about it?
