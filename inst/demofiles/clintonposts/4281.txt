<p>So I am revising my <a href="http://www.jasoncoleman.info/blog/2006/04/top_ten_dropkick_list.html">Top Ten Dropkick </a>list just because some people drop off and get added after a while.  </p>

<p>#10 - Mike Wallce - He makes the top 10 list for the awful awful 60 minutes interview that he did with Mahmoud Ahmadinejad on CBS.  No hard questions,  no journalistic couth,  he basically got down on his knees and made the President look like Mother Teressa.  He gets a big dropkick for coming out of retirement to do this awful piece of work!!!</p>

<p>#9  - Cindy Sheehan - She gets number 9 for getting heat exahustion and passing out while camping out in Texas in the 100 degree weather while protesting the war.  STUPID!!   I would feel better if she went and sat in the desert of Iraq and protested.  I mean,  is there a shortage of bottled water and shade in texas??  She gets a big dropkick in the head for not practicing proper hydration.</p>

<p>#8  - Paris Hilton  - She was #5 on the first list,  she has moved up a little bit,  only because radio has pushed her songs into my head like Nazi propoganda,  so I have to give her props for her marketing skills.....but....she gets a big dropkick for still being a big old slag.   </p>

<p>#7  - Gweneth Paltrow - She has also moved up the list only because she has been on hiatus but has now come out of her 2 year acting ban,  acting like we give a rats foot,  so thats a big dropkick to her waif looking self for coming out of retirement when nobody asked her to do so.</p>

<p>#6  -  The Pakistanian Bombers - This one should be lower on the list,  but I am afriad they will somehow read this and find me in Worcester,  but I am sure my neighborhood is probably more dangerous than the border of Kashmere.  My 7 hour flight to london was turned into 36 hours due to these guys,  so they deserve a big dropkick into their sports bottles for making my trip what I have termed the "Heathrow Hell" </p>

<p>#5  -  Nehad Ahmed  -  The Lebonese Ambassadors BBC interview on Hardtalk was probably what changed my idea form Isreal is in the wrong to Isreal is in the right for attacking Hezbollah.   Every question that was asked was never answered and slighted by saying Isreal was in the wrong,  everytime.  When asked why after 6 years Lebanon never disarmed Hezbollah after 2 UN resolutions and allowed Iran and Syria to arm them,  he would always defer the question to Isreal always being the bain of existance in the mideast and NEVER answering the questions.  Then,  the final straw,  when asked "Does Lebonon want to get disarm Hezbollah?"  he wouldnt answer the question!!!!!  WHAT!!!!! Ok, Ok,  I am not going to get into politics on the top ten list,  but this interview changed a lot of opinions I had.  </p>

<p>#4  - (tie)  Lindsey Lohan - She's on the list just because I AM SO F#$@#%$ SICK of seeing her in the news, you spoiled no good whiney brat!!  Drop kick to those fake boobs of yours.</p>

<p>      - (tie)  Kaite Couric -  She says that she is trying to find a way to sign off after she is done with the news and has thought about "Peace and goodnight."  Please,  if she does this,  I will literally hitchhike to NYC and dropkick her in the street coming out of the CBS building.  The only way she is going to change news is by dying on the air,  and that would be enough cause for me to tune into CBS Evening news.  </p>

<p>#3  - Apple and Sony  -  They tie for #3 because my new Sony Camera broke and my Ipod refuses to work!</p>

<p>#2  - Oprah - Why is she not #1 you may ask.  It's only because she has not mentioned that damn school of hers in Africa for the last month or so,  so I have to take that into consideration.  But...I am still mad at her for not inviting Whoopie Goldberg to her Black Womens Influential thing and she invited BRANDY!!!!  Did she ever see the "Color Purple" ....wait.....SHE WAS IN IT!!!!  She is just stupid,  just STUPID!!</p>

<p>#1  - George Bush  - After running on an Education Platform in 2000.</p>

<p>Promise:   George W. Bush will "fully fund the Pell grant program for first-year students by increasing the maximum grant amount by more than 50 percent, to $5,100."  <i>Source:  Taken from the Bush/Cheney for Education website</i></p>

<p>Reality:     President Bush has frozen the maximum Pell Grant at $4,050 in his FY 2005 education budget. This is the third year in a row that Bush has frozen or cut the maximum Pell Grant. <i>Source: House Committee on Education and the Work Force</i></p>

<p><b>Honerable Mention :  Elizabeth Hasselback, Barbara Walters....actually you know what,  let just say all of "The View" cast,  from cameramen to assistants,  Britney Spears, Scott Storch, Dina Lohan, Kate Hudson, Hillary and Haley Duff and just for kicks....Jessica Simpson.</b></p>
