<p>Now only did Ned Lamont win in Connecticut, but my least favorite congressperson (and boy is it a competitive field) Cynthia McKinney got destroyed in her primary for a <em>second</em> <em>time</em> as an incumbent. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a first or what; she&#8217;s kind of like an anti-Grover Cleveland, but either way it is an impressive feat to squander the advantages of holding elected office twice in a country with a 99% incumbency rate. You really have to want it here -Â  it&#8217;s not enough to be corrupt or out of touch, you need to repeatedly accuse the President of engineering 9/11 and then go Sean Penn on some poor Capitol police officer doing his patriotic duty, who by the way is a racist. Kudos to Rep. McKinney for breaking historic new ground in the field of political suicide.</p>
<p>As for Lamont, my guess is he wins the Senate. Most polls have shown Lieberman ahead in a general race but those don&#8217;t factor in that he is about to lose every endorsement he has from Bill Clinton down, not mention their fundraising and campaign speeches. It will take a special kind of stubborness for Senator Lieberman to ignore the inevitable pleas from all of his closest allies to step down as well as likely threats to all his committee positions in the Senate if he persists in his run. Whether this means anything for the greater elections in general, I really don&#8217;t know. People are clearly angry about the war, and judging by the three primary defeats yesterday alone, angry at incumbents in general. But there&#8217;s still three months to go and that&#8217;s a long time for things to change. The President could announce an exit strategy for Iraq to undercut the Dems&#8217; position (and some Republicans&#8217; as well) or some new wedge issue could pop up and distract us from the war and the deficit (gay adoption, gay flag burning, gay immigration.) Nevertheless, this primary has the potential to go down as a turning point in electoral politics here. Can&#8217;t wait to see how things play out.
