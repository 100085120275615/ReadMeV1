<p><span class="dropcap"></span>A couple of days ago, both MSNBC and NewsMax.com wrote articles about the &#8220;Draft Condi&#8221; movement. It was great to get more exposure! I only wish our Executive Director Jessie Jane Duff had been quoted. There was one glaring point made in both articles that I really think needs to be clarified: her position on abortion. </p>
</p>
<p>On March 11, 2005, in an interview with &#8220;The Washington Times&#8221;, Condi said she was &#8220;mildly pro-choice&#8221;. This has been used by journalists and pundits all over the country to prove, &#8220;Condi&#8217;s Pro-Choice!!! See?!!! &#8221; It was even mentioned in Dick Morris&#8217; book &#8220;Condi vs. Hillary&#8221;. What exactly did she mean by that statement? When I think of &#8220;Pro-Choice&#8221; as a position, I understands that to mean unrestricted, abortion on demand, for any reason, regardless of trimester. The &#8220;Pro-Choice&#8221; label may mean something different in other people&#8217;s minds. The &#8220;Pro-Life&#8221; label also carries the same caveat. Some may think that means a complete ban on abortion, even in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I think there are a lot more people in between these two extremes of the spectrum. The &#8220;Pro-Choice&#8221; and &#8220;Pro-Life&#8221; labels aren&#8217;t necessarily enough to articulate one&#8217;s position.</p>
</p>
<p>Luckily for us, Condi did get the opportunity to <strong>fully </strong>articulate her position on abortion on March 13, 2005 on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221;. Tim Russert, <strike>one of a few</strike>, the only main stream media personality I can tolerate , asked her to explain her &#8220;mildly pro-choice&#8221; position. She said, &#8220;I favor parental notification. I favor a ban on late term abortion. But I myself am not a fan of having the government intervene in the laws.&#8221; Tim asked her if she would outlaw abortion, and she said , &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Tim then asked her about the Federal Government&#8217;s end to federal funds going to non-governmental agencies that provide counseling and family planning because it doesn&#8217;t want abortion suggested as an option. With regard to that, Condi said , &#8221; It&#8217;s the President&#8217;s policies. I happen to agree. I also am not someone who believes that federal funding ought to be used for something about which there is so much difference in America.&#8221;</p>
</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not sure if that position is &#8220;Pro-Choice&#8221; position or a &#8220;Pro-Life&#8221; position. I don&#8217;t think NOW is going to knock on her door any time soon asking her to speak at a fundraising dinner, though.</p>
