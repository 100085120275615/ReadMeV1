<div>Bothered reading Ann Coulter for one and it turns out to be an article on abortion.  In it she stated:
<br />
<br />
<i>I've never heard of anyone who thinks abortion should not be "available" to save the life of the mother. There was never a law in any state that prohibited abortion to save the life of the mother. If Hillary "respects" even this (nonexistent) lunatic fringe of the pro-life movement, she must adore the rest of us!</i>
<br />
<br />Honestly, I've never thought much on that point beyond parroting the line that "of course that would be allowed" as the only means of showing my sanity to be of a satisfactory level to condtinue debate.  Though as it stands now, and Coulter makes a point of, Abortion debate is an item that's been removed from the table so discussion tends to revolve around the "how" more than the "why".  So should abortion be available to save the life of the mother?  Is that acceptable?
<br />
<br />Let us take first the stance that a fetus is a human life and that elective abortion is murder.  Is having an abortion to save the life of a mother elective or not is pretty simple.  Let's say you're a parent of a proud little boy -- we'll call him Hansel.  Your spouse is found to have a terminal condition that may only be cured by killing Hansel -- say... to harvest his spleen for transplant -- so you pick up your .357, cock the hammer and...  
<br />
<br />I guess we'll chalk that one under the murder column.
<br />
<br />What about a case of rape or incest?  Many hardened pro-lifers would insist that noone could be so cruel as to force a woman -- who being the victim of a crime -- to carry to term such an unwanted little bundle of criminal cells.  The standard pro-life line is that elective abortion in this case is not murder.
<br />
<br />Taking only a brief nod at the hypocrisy involved in any such argument that uses the word "unwanted" we'll move straight to the case of the fetus being partly that of a criminal seed.  Let's say you're at a family style wilderness outing whereupon there are many parent/child pairs.  At some point for an unknown reason Jim walks up and busts your chops.  After the police have hauled Jim off, you are given the dubious honour of taking care of his child for the remaining duration of the outing.  Being well within your Rights as the victim you are, you pick up your .357, point it at Jim's daughter, Gretel, cock the hammer and...
<br />
<br />Maybe only 3rd degree murder?
<br />
<br />For a third example let's look at the health exception that occasionally come up should the child be destined to be seriously deformed or mentally handicapped.  Just covering the bases mind you.  So you walk up to this year's Special Olympics, throw the bolt on your AK and...
<br />
<br />Yeh, yeh, no difference yet.
<br />
<br />I think it's safe to say that the rape, incest, health exceptions commonly touted still leave such abortions as an elective choice.  One that considers abortion to be murder cannot likewise say these exceptions are not just as arbitrary as the "viability" line that has been drawn by the pro-abortionists.
<br />
<br />All of this is so patently simple to see if you accept that abortion is murder that it took more time to smoke a cigarette than think these issues to their ends.  So my question is:  Why is it so infrequently heard from the "abortion is murder" crowd?  Do they, like me, just toss this out as a point of measuring the distance between their knuckles and the floor while discussing other, unrelated, points of abortion so that the debate will stay on course?  Or have they never thought about it, like me, beyond the ick-wisdom of "I would never do <b>that</b>!  What do you take me for?"</div>
