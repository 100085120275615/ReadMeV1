<div><p> "If you want to be President, decide it at the age of five, and then live accordingly."<br />
- Helen Thomas </p>

<p>Okay, I admit it.  I must have channelled Helen as a kindergartener.  Somewhere amid Bicentennial celebrations, repeated solo renditions of "Rhinestone Cowboy," and some truly awful double-knit polyester outfits, I took Helen's advice to heart. [Aside:  What the HECK were they thinking?  It's one thing to mix brown paisleys and blue stripes on the same shirt.  But it's simply unforgiveable to put that visual train wreck onto first-generation synthetic fibers -- in the form of a <em>turtleneck</em>, for goodness' sake -- and then force it onto a five-year old living in the sweltering humidity bazaar that is San Antonio, Texas.  I still have a rash.]  From early childood on, I analyzed my every word, every action with an eye toward future electability.</p>

<p>Should I learn the words to "Puff, the Magic Dragon?"  No, possible drug references there might be too hard to explain away in 2024.  And why didn't I join in with the other kids whose biting political satire changed the Oscar-Mayer jingle tag line to "'Cause Jimmy Carter has a way of screwing up the USA?"  I wasn't sure if I was a Democrat or Republican yet (I'm still not sure).  No sense in taking a position at 8 that you might regret at 48!</p>

<p>My only mistake may have been . . . musical theater.  From that first live performance -- a laugh-a-minute musical comedy about Noah's Ark (they seem to have left out all the drowning) -- it was hard to break the habit.  High school drama club.  College productions of <em>Jesus Christ, Superstar</em> and other shows.  Glee club.  I was on the hard stuff before I knew it.</p>

<p>But hopefully my future devotion to the holy trinity redeemed those youthful indiscretions.  If years of football, track, and beer (enjoyed in moderation, of course) can't make up for my adolescent affection for early Andrew Lloyd Webber, then my political aspirations are history.  And if they find out I played soccer after the age of ten, I'm <em>really </em> toast. . . </p>

<p>Seriously, I really have lived my life with an eye toward staying electable.  I know that could come off as a little shallow; as somehow not <em>passionate</em> enough for a Future Leader of the Free World (TM).  I disagree,  but we can talk about that later.  Instead, I'd rather waste some words now discussing how Clinton, Bush, Kerry, Gore, and Cheney apparently approached the same issue, primarily in connection with the issues of military service and Vietnam.</p>

<p>Here are the usual disclaimers:  I'm far less of an expert than I think I am.  I believe despite ample evidence to the contrary that I can in fact read minds, including the minds of prominent public figures living thousands of miles away.  I suffer other delusions of grandeur as well.  I have one dog, one cat, one son, one daughter, one wife, and two cars.  I still have my hair.  I put "products" in it.  I can watch 30 hours of football or more in one weekend.  For purposes of the preceding sentence, and with overflowing praise for The Worldwide Leader In Sports, the "weekend" begins on Thursdays most weeks (but sometimes Wednesdays or even Tuesdays), and it ends on Monday night.  At least during the "Fall," which, thanks again to ESPN, begins in late July and ends as late as February.  I'm not sold on the 3-4 defense.</p>

<p>[Warning:  from this point forward, I will be turning on the "Freudinator,"  a magical device that allows me to conclude definitively that every political candidate's internal motivation is in fact sexual obsession with his/her mother/father]</p>

<p>Actually, I've changed my mind.  Instead, I'd like to know what YOU think.  I have some tentative conclusions (none of them particularly kind to any of our most prominent Vietnam-era pols), but would love to hear from others before I offer my observations.  I'd most like to hear your thoughts about the five folks I identify above, but feel free to comment on others as well.</p>

<p>And by the way, I'm not so deludedly arrogant that I really think I'll be President someday.  I'm shooting for Senator or Maximum Leader for Life.</p>

<p>Comment away!</p></div>
