<p>Ok folks, here's the thing, I've been meaning to write this for a while. You Senators need a reality check. Stop running for President, and give it a rest.</p>

<p>Senators; Binden, Kerry, Clinton, Edwards, Bayh, Feingold, McCain, Allen, Frist etc... <br />
<strong>The American voting public no likey you, your extensive voting records, your inside the beltway mentality, and your dumbass comments <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060828/ap_on_el_pr/biden_politics_2">like these</a>... <br />
The last Senator to win the Presidency was JFK. </strong></p>

<p>Need I remind these folks the last successful Presidency bids have been Governors... NOT Congress people. Hell even on the West Wing a Senator can't win. Discuss, but I'm not planning on helping any of the above in the Primaries. I will help a credible Governor, having 2 more early primaries will help define the field too. </p>
