<p>As I come up for a gulp of air, out of the swirling black-hole project of galactic proportions, I see <a href="http://theanchoressonline.com/2006/08/21/anchoress-called-on-to-retract-support-for-rudy/" title="Anchoress on Rudy" target="_blank">the Anchoress is up and well again</a>.  Hooray!</p>
<blockquote><p>God works as God will, regardless of our sensibilities. I believe that God is not done with Rudy Giuliani, just as he is not done with you or me or <a href="http://theanchoressonline.com/2006/08/01/mel-gibson-fjbs-qana-wmds-and-grace/" title="Anchoress on Mel" target="_blank">Mel Gibson</a>.  As my Liâl Bro Thom says to me: <i>Grace builds on nature. And all those high-falutinâ social issues wonât matter diddly squat once Iran is armed and aiming its big guns at the West, demanding we convert or die.</i></p>

<p>Difficult times demand of us difficult choices. From where I sit, it doesnât appear that endorsing someone who strictly adheres to orthodox Catholicism will necessarily get the job done that needs doing, to defeat the larger and more ominous forces that are threatening our nation, Western Civilization and, yes, our faith. Can you show me the conservative Christian/Catholic candidate <i>who is electable</i> (yes, that matters) and who would take a strong enough stand in favor of America, and in opposition to appeasement? The ideal does not exist.</p>
<p>There are no accidents, and it was not an accident that Rudy Giuliani was the Mayor of NYC on 9/11. Just think, had he not been diagnosed with prostate cancer and forced to withdraw from the 2000 senate race, he might well have been in Washington during that attack - gathered in the Capitol Rotunda, (with United 93 bearing down upon him) - along with everyone else in DC (except, oddly, Hillary Clinton) for a big hoo-hah event focusing on Education.</p>
<p>Giuliani would not have been in the middle of NYC, and that city would have died under the ministrations of the ineffectual Mark Greene. There is a reason why Giuliani was there that day - perhaps we were meant to see him in action, in that role, on a global stage.</p></blockquote>

Ben says what I&#8217;ve had in the back of my mind for quite a while.
