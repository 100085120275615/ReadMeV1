<p><strong>People who insist on depicting</strong> Joe Liebermanâs loss to Ned Lamont in the Connecticut Democratic primary as simply a protest against the war in Iraq are on the wrong track. Neither is it the case that Lamontâs victory represents a turn to the left for the party as a whole. When did an honest expression of dissatisfaction with an elected official necessarily have to be framed as either right or left?  Voters didnât object to Liebermanâs honest expression of support for the war effort so much as they disapproved of his statements on the Senate floor that opposing opinions were unacceptable and served to weaken the president in a time of war.<br />
<strong>And they werenât crazy about his willingness</strong> to go along with Republicans in the Terry Schiavo case or his support of school vouchers, the energy bill, the new bankruptcy guidelines or his vote regarding employee pensions during the airline bankruptcy proceedings. And his willingness to consider private Social Security accounts was definitely not a bedrock principle of the Democratic Party. What Senator Lieberman might call bi-partisan cooperation was, to many Democrats, an indication that his party loyalty lay in the other camp. It is one thing to get along and quite another to just go along. <br />
<strong>Somewhere along the line</strong> he seemed to have forgotten where he was from and that he needed either to listen to his constituents more closely or explain himself to them more effectively. Perhaps most infuriating, beyond the issue of party loyalty, is his constant pontificating and moralizing. His rebuke of President Clinton during the impeachment brouhaha was nauseating. Nevertheless, Clinton and others of the party faithful came out to support him in the primary campaign - - a standard Lieberman chooses not to uphold as he intends to run as an Independent in November or, as he annoyingly refers to himself, an âindependent Democrat.â  No such designation will appear on any ballot, and he should be called on it every time he tries to use it.<br />
<strong>With respect to Iraq</strong>, many may regard his vote and that of others to invade that country as wrong-headed and short-sighted, but that has long since ceased to be the point. What galls voters of all descriptions is that Lieberman, and other rosy picture painters, often return from Iraq and say things are improving there when people who know better look at each other quizzically and ask what country did this guy just visit? Falling in line with those strange assurances offered up by President Bush about Iraqâs âunity governmentâ and the fact that âthe peopleâ voted or that the problems are due to  acts of terroristism simply adds to growing doubts on the part of the American people. It should be remembered that Iraqis turned out en masse to vote for Saddam Hussein in the bad old days.<br />
<strong>It seems clear in any case</strong> that we are not actually at war in Iraq anymore. We won the war rather early on, and what is going on now is an ill-defined mission that seems to lead nowhere. One sometimes hears people in this country offer up solutions like ânuke âemâ, convert them to Christianity, and so on. And so âthemâ becomes this amorphous group of âothersâ we supposedly liberated and for whom we have provided the gift of democracy. Our troops really have no idea who the enemy is, the Iraqi people have no idea in whom to put their trust and disorder is plainly not war, itâs just disorder. <br />
<strong>It isnât easy, of course</strong>, to resolve a four-year debacle, but many voters in this country seem to have concluded that âstay the courseâ is not a strategy. Something has to change, and occasionally a baby step at the polls can provide momentum upon which to build. It is rare that out of nowhere a candidate can so rally the public that a wellspring of hope and enthusiasm develops, that voters actually feel they can make a difference. Sure, Lamont had some money of his own, but supporters began to contribute in the early days of his campaign as well. For Senator Lieberman to whine about Lamontâs wealth and criticize him for what he calls partisan politics is beyond ludicrous given his own war chest and his attempt to portray himself as an honest broker, who just happens to sound a lot like one of the good old boys in a Republican-dominated government.<br />
<strong>Liebermanâs concession speech</strong> was one of the least gracious, most bitter and most condescending Iâve ever heard. Al Gore was, some said, far too gracious in conceding defeat in the 2000 presidential election, but he was statesmanlike in his remarks as he attempted to heal the rift caused by the recount rancor. No such approach was taken by the good senator; his bellicose call for support was unseemly and discordant and provided an insight into the true nature of the man.<br />
<strong>If a certain exhilaration</strong> emanated from Lamont headquarters tonight, an ugly tinge of meanness emerged in the Lieberman camp. The primary that turns out not to be defining lets the air out of the process to some degree, but the gauntlet was most certainly thrown by a man who managed to give voice to many whose thoughts and feelings have been muted for too long. In November Senator Lieberman will have to depend on Republicans for support which is after all a statement in itself.<br />
