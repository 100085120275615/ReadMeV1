<div>There's not many things I adore more than seeing a rabid animal turn on it's own pack.<br />Not that I have actually seen one, but I can imagine what would happen.<br />
<br />Take this for instance:<br />
<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jonathan-tasini/hillary-thanks-for-raisi_b_27844.html" target="_blank">Hillary, Thanks For Raising Our Taxes | The Huffington Post</a>:<br />
<br />Hereâs something Hillary Clinton and other pro-war Democrats wonât tell Democratic voters: by voting for the war, pro-war Democrats have imposed higher taxes or cuts in social programs on every American for years to come.<br />[...]<br />If troops stay in Iraq as long as 2015âa reasonable scenario given the current situationâthe cost could potentially reach as high as $2 trillion. By supporting the war and occupation, Hillary Clinton has saddled every New Yorker with higher taxes and a lower standard of living.<br />[...]<br />
</blockquote>Wait a minute.  I thought you <a href="http://curmudgeonlyskeptical.blogspot.com/2006/08/hezbocrats.html">Hezbocrats </a>were all over this Hillary running for prez shit. You know, all about how great she would be since she's done such a fine job for New York.<br />
<br />But wait!  There's more!:<br />

</div> The truth is that the incumbent is now the best friend of the very corporate interests that are bankrupting millions of Americans.<br />[...]<br />
</blockquote>Well no fucking shit, Sherlock.  Welcome to reality.<br />
<br />At least, so I thought.  Briefly.  For a minute there.<br />Then he starts talking about the benefits of socialized medicine.  He says:<br />
<blockquote>Such a plan would save our country $660 billion a year, if health care could be provided as efficiently in the United States as in Canada.</blockquote>That's it.  I just puked a little in my mouth.  This dude is nuts.  Plain and simple.<br />He has obviously been getting his information from someone other than FUCKING PATIENTS <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/20/health/main681801.shtml?cmp=EM8705" target="_blank">who have to actually utilize that system</a>.  In fact, those who can afford it are <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/06/10/opinion/main700930.shtml" target="_blank">paying cash for their treatment </a>rather than wait for the government to 'take care of them'. <br />
<br />And guess what they do if they don't have the money, and don't want to wait, or CAN'T wait  for the government to get around to treating them?:<br />
<blockquote>The United States has been a safety valve for Canadians unwilling or unable to tolerate the long waits for medical care in their country.<br />
</blockquote>Yup.  WE take care of them. <br />That's swell.  Great plan you got there dumbass.  Just what America needs.</div>
