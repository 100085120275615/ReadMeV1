Really Dears,<br />
It's all terribly the same.<br />
I mean it.  Every day the New York Times <b>ISN'T</b> running an editorial that says "Impeach Now" is another day that things will get messed up.<br />
Most of the country, it seems, has settled into a nice fetal position, waiting for the evil to pass.  Oh sure, there might be a chance that Democrats can take the House, and we've certainly got to do all that we can to make it happen, but be prepared, the Republicans might be running the show until 2008.  Hopefully at the end of this election cycle we'll get a real Presidential Contender whose theme is "Stop Destroying Our Country" instead of <a href="http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3145993">"I heard that there were digital Boobies in that Video Game."</a> Thanks, Hillary!  I was scared that in November of 2005 you might be defending the Constitution or investigating the loss of a Major American City.  Nice to know that you and Joe Liebermann were able to find a little time to Pander to the American Family Council, as if they didn't already think that you were Satana, She-Daughter of Satan!  <br />
I heard that Gas prices are up.  Funny, didn't this happen before the 2004 Election, also?  A cynic might say that Big Oil thinks the jig is up and is engaging in a little profit taking before they have to comply with the Law again.  But of course I'm not a cynic.  Otherwise I would have thought that they would try a double whammy; raise the prices enough in advance of the election that they can cut towards the end of the cycle and make everything seem better, and take a little profit in case somebody that will enforce the laws mistakenly gets elected.  But why should we think like that, right?<br />
Oh, I guess that some people are happy that Arlen Specter (I never did get a straight answer, any relation to Phil?) is <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/nationworld/nation/ny-uswire284720076apr28,0,5698331.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-print"> making noises about the Constitution and the Rule of Law,</a> but really, Auntie is not holding her breath.  Uncle Arlen and your Uncle John McCain always talk tough, but then as soon as Bill Frist scowls at them they back down.  That's how they get the reputation of independents coupled with the big bucks associated with the wingnut conservative bloc.  Oh wait!  Using my super-powers of literacy, I notice that he backed down IN THE ARTICLE!  He says "I'm not prepared to call for the withholding of funds."  Oh Uncle Arlen is such a Magician!  He gets to take a stand and back off of it IN THE SAME BREATH!  It used to be that Our Glorious Leader was the only one who could do that!<br />
Uncle Arlen and Uncle John should be careful, though, otherwise they might actually DO something this time.  But don't worry, whatever they do will <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/03/24/bush_shuns_patriot_act_requirement/">have a signing statement attached that says "If I Feel Like It."</a><br />
And <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-042706fema_lat,0,2765440.story?coll=la-home-headlines">you can say goodbye to FEMA.</a>  I guess we won't have them to kick around, anymore.  It's a shame, because I actually rather liked them.  But like several other things this White House picked up, they broke it and then said that since it's broken they might as well throw it away and make a new one.  Which they have certainly done so well with!  I mean just look at Homeland Security!  Or the cool new idea they have for <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0427/p02s01-usmi.html">Guarding the White Sands MISSLE RANGE with Private Security!</a>  After all, John Candy was so good in that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090660/">"Armed and Dangerous"</a> movie that he could guard all the Test-missiles, right?<br />
Well, I guess there is nothing left to do.  Please bring your Auntie another Martini, and let me dream of a day back when Democrats used to stand for something.  In the meantime, I'm going to think about the <a href=" http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4912040.stm"> Bosnian Pyramids</a> and play with the Web.  I'll have some funny (but not political) things up this weekend.  Next week I'll try to quit smoking so I'll be mean enough to really rant at the insanity that runs rampant in our Nation's Capitol (for our Canadian Friends, that applies to your nation's capitol as well!  How is Mr. Harper these days, anyway?).
