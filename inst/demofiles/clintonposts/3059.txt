<div>Former First Lady, Senator, and <s>likely</s> certain 2008 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (D.-NY), along with Sen. John "Who?" Kerry (D.- MA) and Sen. Barbara Boxer (D.- Pluto) <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-02-17-clinton-vote_x.htm">introduced a new voting reform bill today</a>. A couple of proposals in the bill (paper receipts and more federal aid for states to update voting procedures) are worth debate. But the deal-breaker for me is the idea, raised in all seriousness, of LETTING EX-FELONS VOTE. What in the hell? Call me paranoid, but Hillary has to be figuring that ex-felons voting = eight more years of the Clinton White House. And she may well be right. But there isn't even any decent cover story here. How do you justify this one? Did not one reporter bother to ask the Senator why convicted rapists should have as much say in determining our president as, for example, I do? Would there be a certain level at which the awfulness of the crime prohibited a person from voting? Keep in mind, I don't have the full transcript. If Hillary or any of the other characters with her answered one of these questions, please feel free to correct me. Anyway, it seems to me that this one should be the main headline of the day. Somehow, it isn't. Hmmm... I wonder why. You'd think a proposal like this would cause a hard-nosed press corps to ask a powerful senator about how, exactly, suffrage for ex-felons would strenghten American democracy. Oh, I forgot. She's a Democrat. She doesn't have to defend what she says.<br />
<br />Also catch this line from Senator Barbara Boxer (who, by the way, still hasn't apologized for using a blatant falsehood to bash Condi Rice over the head during the then-Secretary designate's confirmation hearings):<br />
<br />" [The bill] is meant to ensure the election debacle of 2000, and the serious election irregularities of 2004, never ever happen again."<br />
<br />Translation: We got our asses handed to us last year, and instead of doing hard stuff like moving our party to the center we'd rather let rapists vote.</div>
