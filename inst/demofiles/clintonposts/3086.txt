<br />I suggest you not spend too much time searching for a strong connection between the above stated two comments.

<br />I have enjoyed the last 6 days. I cannot fully appreciate what the "Beat Bush" faction have been suffering this week. All I know is that I am totally relieved and very happy with Bush re-election. I do have a vague memory of what I felt when Hillary, ahem - Bill, beat Father Bush in 1992. Oh, I am so grateful I don't have to go through that situation again.
