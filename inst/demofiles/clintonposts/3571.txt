<blockquote>"I would advise them to first get out of their quagmire in Iraq before getting into an even bigger one" - <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/04/15/060415084241.xdv0o3w3.html">link</a>

</blockquote>No, this was not John Kerry repeating Ted Kennedy's words, nor is it Hillary or even Howard Dean. Although all of them have said things like this before. The person who said this is General Safavi, a high ranking official in the Iran Terrorist Regime. Does anyone else find it odd when Iranian terrorists are saying the exact same things as the radical leftist in America. If I didn't know better I would think that the left is on the side of Iran and not on the side of America.</div>
