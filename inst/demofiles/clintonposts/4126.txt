<p>"That's because while Lamont's victory is a promising development, it marks the beginning of the end for an old favorite of Washington insiders: the tactics of triangulation. Originally employed as a survival strategy by a Democratic president in the wake of 1994's Republican revolution, the policy of seizing the political middle ground no longer makes sense in an era when any attempt at bipartisanship is understood as a sign of Democratic weakness and exploited accordingly.</p>                     <p>Had triangulation worked, we'd be in a different moment. But for six long years, it hasn't. Even Sen. Hillary Clinton has seen the writing on the wall in recent weeks, criticizing the Bush team's Iraq fiasco by publicly confronting Donald Rumsfeld, calling on him to resign and demanding that troop withdrawals from Iraq begin soon.</p><p><span>With triangulation passing, a new era of bolder, principle-driven politics can begin. Lamont's success should be the opening salvo in a 90-day campaign to establish the clear-cut differences between Democrats and Republicans. Most independent voters, like Democrats, want change, but many of them aren't sure yet whether Democratic candidates are capable of giving it to them. Now's the chance to seize that mantle."</span> - <a href="http://www.madison.com/tct/opinion/column/index.php?ntid=94676&ntpid=1">Eli Pariser</a> in <span>The Capital Times</span><br /></p>Well, if Senator Joseph Lieberman makes a comback by forging a coalition of Republicans who think their candidate has no chance, independent centrists, and a sizable portion of Lieberman Democrats who are willing to break party ranks to vote for someone they believe his votes are Democratic enough, the era of of "triangulation" and its more respectable formulation - bipartisan government - will be spared. If Lamont loses, the ideologues who voted for him would be repudiated and taught a lesson - go back to the middle.<br /><br />Senator Lieberman lost his supporters in Washington but it can be regained if they watch Connecticut voters in general put him back in office. The friends he easily lost he can easily regained, particularly when both parties will be vying for his support if control in the senate depends upon one vote.<br /> <br />
