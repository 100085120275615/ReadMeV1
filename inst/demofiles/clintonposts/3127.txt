<div>Hillary Clinton the Centrist and her comrades are launching all-out assault on Republicans, hoping to gather enough votes of the moderates in way of staying away from the far left side of their party.<br />
<br />Well, they may succeed given the political atmosphere.<br />
<br />You see, the same way the democrats worry about the conservatives in power will cater to the extreme right wing, you got to ponder what these centrists will do on behalf of the far left after they seize power.<br />
<br />The name of the political game has always been getting the votes.<br />
<br />Politicians will change their own stance on issues in order to get your votes, Republicans or Democrats alike.<br />
<br />Once the votes are counted and their fate are decided, only the next round of voting will bring them back to earth.<br />
<br />Well, not all of them are like that, otherwise democracy just won't work.<br />
<br />That is why, it is so important to vote for leaders and statesmen, instead of pure politicians.<br />
<br />Use your common sense, and be an informed voter.</div>
