Geneva Johnson is a 14 year old African American child who is a victim of the so called child protective system in New York City. Her uncle, Sheldon Johnson has been campaigning and trying to bring attention to the abuses that NYPD and ACS perpetrated on Geneva and her grandmother.<br /><br />I personally informed Commissioner Mattingly about two managers in particular who simply refused to allow caseworkers to seek out kinship resources for children taken into foster care, Child Prtotective Manager Rodney Jackson, and so called "acting Child Protective Manager" Elaine Davis. Mattingly thanked me for the information and indeed a review of kinship placement statistics at Emergency Children's Services was conducted, however neither Jackson nor Davis were punished nor retrained and kinship placement figures for ACs remain low.<br /><br /><br />Story Title:<br />Child abuse by N.Y.C.

It was determined that an emergency removal was necessary because the case worker claimed that her grandmother exhibits bizarre behavior; and the absence of furniture in her home with the exception of a dresser and a few chairs.<br />Supervising Judge Susan Knipps of family court (60 Lafayette st) signed the emergency removal order for Geneva Johnson with insufficient proof and no professional testimony, no legal representation or examination of the alleged victim who was 13 at the time. In fact on 2/3/05 the next day the Judge did not allow Geneva to speak in court, and her Law guardian (Natalie Albert) did not represent Genevaâs best interest in court concerning the innocence of her grandmother. Instead they plotted to place her into a DRC facility and have her mentally evaluated and medicated. The Judge violated Family court act 1028 by directing Ms. Lackeyâs newly appointed attorney Ms. Baronoff not to have the 72 hour hearing that she is entitled to get Geneva back home.<br />In fact no family resource was contacted nor were any services offered as required by the NYS family court act to avoid removal of Geneva or placement into foster care. Ms. Lackey and Geneva are both dedicated Christians of Jehovah witnesses and neither has any history of mental illness, abuse or criminal activity. On 2/17/05 I went to family court with the hopes to get Geneva placed into my care until this tragedy passed over. I was informed by Angelica Reyes and Natalie Albert: âthat the only way I can get Geneva placed into my custody is to go thru an ICPC which can take upwards from anywhere to 3 to 6 months and until then she will have to remain in foster care.â<br />I knew what they were telling me did not make any sense; weâre living in America, and the law cannot possibly be that screwed up, I remembered reasoning to my self. I next challenged the allegations against my mother and asked for an explanation. I was informed that my mother was believed to be mentally ill and my niece was removed for imminent risk to life and health. I immediately asked for their proof to this ridiculous allegation and they replied it was confidential and that Iâm not a party to this case (docket no: N-1301/05 NYS family court 60 Lafayette st.).<br />The Judge informed my mother that she and Geneva will have to see the court psychiatrist to determine her mental status if she wants her granddaughter back. Ms. Lackey never has been to a clinical psychiatrist, thus without professional diagnosis what is the basis for the Judge to account for an assessment? Ms. Lackey will not comply with the Judgeâs wishes because itâs obvious that the courts doctors will find an unfavorable diagnosis to support the courts claims especially since the removable was done on very deliberate and questionable grounds. The burden of proof should fall on the accuser not the accused.<br />On 3/24/05 Elvis Liburd and Robert Griffith of the dept. of social services petitioned the Supreme Court ex parte motion part (index 400985/05) for an order to gain access into Ms. Lackeyâs home. They claimed that she was mentally impaired and exhibits psychotic, paranoid, schizophrenic behavior and that she has auditory hallucinations amongst other things. On 3/30/05 Mr. Griffith and 6 NYPD officers and a psychiatrist showed up at Ms. Lackeyâs residence in a failed attempt to force my mother into psychiatric care. I immediately went down to confront Mr. Griffith about the fictitious claim he bought against my mother and threatened the dept. of Social Services with a lawsuit. They later dropped their case against my mother (foajm.2645851). I later discovered that I can apply for legal guardianship for Geneva; a right that was deliberately withheld from me by ACS, family court and Genevaâs law guardian.<br />On 6/13/05 I was denied the right to file for legal guardianship for my niece Geneva by family court clerk Thomas OâConnor who I immediately reported to the inspector general office with no satisfaction till this date in writing. During Genevaâs stay in foster care, ACS has failed to enroll her into school or provide home schooling for her. In fact Geneva has been neglected and abused in most of the foster homes they placed her in; all her cries for help fell upon deaf ears when those crimes were properly reported to ACS officials, her law guardian, and the mayorâs office. I have even written to the Governorâs office, John Mattingly (ACS), the Mayor, various politicians and all law enforcement agencies on her behalf and explained in full detail about the seriousness of the crimes and the abuse that she is suffering each day; nobody did anything.<br />Geneva grew tired of the educational neglect and the lack of help she was receiving from those who were supposed to be protecting her. It really bothered her that she has been to court more than 18 times and was not allowed to have a voice in court from the Judge even though she is now 14 years old. She was concerned as to why her fact finding hearing did not start as of yet and she grew weary of the psychological conditioning that they were subjecting on her each day. Geneva decided to leave ACS custody after a failed rape attempt at one of their facilities. She returned back to the safety of her family late in the summer of 2005 to escape the many abuses she endured during her tenure in ACS care.<br />On 12/19/05 ACS workers Sophia Nunez, Michael Navas and 6 officers from NYPD came to Ms. Lackeyâs residents and forcibly removed Geneva, painfully handcuffing her in the process while refusing to present or leave the court order they claim they had to justify their actions. Geneva knew she had to get away from this callous agency that did nothing but abuse her and try to force medication on her. She returned home to her Grandmother the next day and went to the hospital for her sore wrist and shortness of breath and filed a complaint against the police officers. A little over a week later on the 28th ACS worker Charles Emanuel along with officers from NYPD Came to Ms. Lackeys home to remove Geneva. This time Ms. Lackey refuse to open the door until they show their court order, instead they chose to break down the door and swarm into her apartment. P.O. Pitts (shield # 2457) threatened to shoot Ms. Lackey on the spot if she moved and ordered her to shut up and get off the phone. Ms. Lackey refused because she was calling for help. The officers began to push her around and then P.O. Cano (shield # 8153) pulled the phone wire out of the wall then pushed Ms. Lackey who is 64 years old out into her hallway barefoot.<br />Geneva was in the bathroom taking a bath when this entire ruckus started. She was frozen and very scared and did not want to leave her grandmother. Geneva was ordered out the bathroom by the responding officers and she informed them that she was in the bathtub. Next, under Sgt. Caruso command, a Swat team from the 19th precinct with laser guided weapons and full body armor bust down the door and pulled Geneva NAKED out of the tub in full view of the 20 or more police officerâs and the ACS worker, all who were MEN. The officers then painfully handcuffed Geneva and wrapped some sheets around her out of the linen closets and marched her away barefoot in the dead of winter crying like sheâs a savage animal or some crazed killer. Next, they took her to Metropolitan Hospital where they injected her with some type of medication while she is still handcuffed with her hands behind her back. Then they put her into a straight jacket and placed her into a psych ward at a DRC facility on 17th street & 2nd ave. The cowardly, thuggish and terrorizing actions of the police officers were reported to the civilian complaint review board (case # 200515422), Internal Affairs, the Mayors office, the Governors office, Don Mattingly (ACS), Robert Morgenthau-District Attorney, FBI, Rep. Carolyn Maloney and a host of others. Nobody did anything but just let the case die down.<br />Geneva continued to stand firm and returned home to her grandmother on the 30th of December, 2 days after her tragic ordeal. She wrote letters to the Mayor pleading for help, and got nothing, no satisfaction, not even a reply. On 5/7/06 they came back again and took her upstate and locked her up in some type of mental institution. Why is New York City government protecting ACS and Family Court for the obvious crimes they have committed? How many innocent children and parents are subjected to psychiatric evaluation; and are unnecessarily administered mood- stabilizing drugs as a condition to retain the rights of their children?<br />ACS and Family court is being run like a plantation. Itâs a profit-driven industry, a subtle continuation of institutionalized slavery which violates the 13th amendment against slavery and involuntary servitude. Family court has been used to âlegalizeâ this racketeering scheme to rubber stamp ACS state sponsored child & family abuse/neglect cases, and terrorize &amp; subdue underprivileged mothers and their children; mostly Afro-American and Latino. What do they want with Geneva so badly? She did not commit a crime so why do they treat her so? Why are they not educating her? Is this some type of behavior modification experimentation? Why are these individuals being allowed to operate like a secret cult with total impunity within our government?<br />Constituents of New York please VOICE your OUTRAGE. Today they are targeting motherâs that are considered underprivileged, tomorrow it may be your kids. Please stand up and make the guilty party accountable for their crimes. This is CHILD ABUSE of the worst kind. Please make copies of this document and help pass the word. Their strength is in their concealment. My niece is being used as a sacrificial lamb for their sadistic experiments; and she needs your help.
