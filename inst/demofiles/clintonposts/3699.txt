<div>Unusual, isn't it.  The left's stance on Pro Choice for women and their Pro Life stance for animals.  Shelters around the country euthanasia millions of animals per year and those of us interested in these creatures of God try to raise money and awareness to try to stop it.  Then, the next day they could be protested a woman's right to choose.<br />
<br />Not to say that people who are Pro Life do not feel the same about animals, but we do not see them out in front of the movement.<br />
<br />Could this be a chance to reconcile and work together, the Red and the Blue of our nation united in a cause?  For those on the right, this will show that they are not hypocritical and show a desire for ALL lives, human or animal to be saved.  For those on the left, it may bring them to understand where the hearts and minds of those on the opposite side.<br />
<br />Even Hillary Clinton has molded her message that the amount of abortions in this country must go down.  The two sides on this issue have never been able to meet. It is worse that the NHL and the Player's Union (yes, I miss hockey).<br />
<br />Let's start somewhere.  Maybe animals are the starting point.  Let's look at shelters and find a way for them to reduce their death rolls, spay and neuter pets, stop buying pre-fabbed pets from pet stores, give to these causes, get involved!<br />
<br />Pets are not commodities.  If you have a cat or dog, this ball of love needs to be cared for.  Just like a child.  It is your child.</div>
