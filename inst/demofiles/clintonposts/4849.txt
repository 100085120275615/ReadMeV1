<p>Today I&#8217;m coming to you from the suburbs of Brussels, Belgium, where I&#8217;m staying this weekend in celebration of my godson&#8217;s 12th birthday. But now onto more serious matters:</p>
<p>I tend not to talk about US senate races and republicans versus democrats and crap like that.  Mostly because there are a zillion blogs working for either party fulltime, so why bother further beating one very dead horse.  </p>
<p>Yet for all the bla bla bla about this guy named Lieberman who is a disgrace of a human being even though all the haters voted for him oh-so-often, and how he was beaten thanks to the internets, you don&#8217;t hear much about one Jonathan Tasini. Even though he puts the small d back in democrat.  </p>
<p>Honestly, I could care less if the democrats take back the senate or the house, as they are as guilty of being the architects of all the death, destruction, and decieving as their republican counterparts.  But when it comes to upsurping the comfy two faced democrats who think they&#8217;re going to cruise to victory just for having the big D next to their names, I&#8217;m all for that.  </p>
<p><img src="http://static.flickr.com/98/221509150_91d770f4f4.jpg" align="right" hspace="11" />But what I really wish is that more people took Jonathan Tasini seriously.  Who you ask?  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/0825-03.htm">Jonathan Tasini</a>.. former leader of the National Writers Union, who is running against Hillary Clinton for the democratic nomination in the state of New York.  It should be a &#8220;slam dunk&#8221; for Tasini, since he&#8217;s running against a senator who supported the war in Iraq, and has generally betrayed the principals of civil liberties, human rights, and international law, since the day she got into office.  Hillary Clinton hasn&#8217;t respected democracy or the values of a real &#8220;Democratic&#8221; party since her early days as the first lady.  She is fake as fake can be, and lets be honest, her speeches have that terrible tone like listening to someone scrape their nails against a blackboard.  </p>
<p>Yet the bloggers aren&#8217;t talking much about Tasini&#8217;s challenge.  They&#8217;re too scared to attack their most well known senator&#8230; everyone knows the name Hillary Clinton.  So much for independence and the freedom to be critical on the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Therefore I&#8217;m delving into the senate races from now on, to give much deserved attention to senators who need to be sent packing.  And I&#8217;ll be very busy, since an overwhelming majority need to be replaced.  </p>
