<div>Well, I have to say that this weekend's conference was truly amazing and invigorating. The event was attended by the authors of <a href="http://www.mentalwanderings.com/">Gulch</a> and <a href="http://www.stophernow.blogspot.com/">Hillary Now</a> amongst other; it was held at the <a href="http://www.mcmenamins.com/index.php?loc=10">Barley Mill Pub</a> under tight security. Lively conversation was enjoyed by all and included: Jeff's internal conversation on whether his second drink should be a PBR or another IPA, Will's foray into the dotcom world and the potential for massive wealth therein, and why Jami had twice as many Scrabble point entries as any other player. Because many issues (and a few tater tots) were left tabled, an annual schedule has been deemed unsatisfactory and the second annual NWBC will have to be held within a few months at the latest.</div>
