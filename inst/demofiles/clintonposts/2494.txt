<div>   If you discriminately watched any of the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State-nominee Condoleezza Rice you may have seen the back side of some two-faced senators.
<br />   Still smarting from the thumping they got in November, some Democrats on the committee took advantage of their first opportunity to strike back at the forces on the right that set the 2000 record straight -- with an exclamation point.
<br />   There is very little the liberal left can complain about these days, so they fall back on the old tried-and-true rhetoric that all war is bad, and especially wars waged by Republican administrations. It is my guess that this particular group of selfish liberals still left in Congress under the Democratic banner -- thank goodness their number is getting smaller -- would have fought to the bitter end to prevent the Revolution, the Civil War, and possibly even the Great War (WWI) and World War II. The Congressional war protestors have that distinct smell of withered flowers and stale marijuana smoke which hangs on to hippies of the 60s who never had to grow up.
<br />   So, since they did not have the President or Vice President sitting in the seat in front of them, they gleefully disparaged Dr. Rice, impugning her integrity, mocking the Secretary of Defense, and calling everybody who has had anything to do with Administration policy a bold-faced liar.
<br />   There are two main reasons Senators John Kerry, Barbara Boxer, and Joe Biden attacked Dr. Rice so vehemently. 
<br />   The first reason is their collective guilt from defending the self-proclaimed liar who preceded President Bush in the White House. These and many other defenders of Bill Clinton still feel the lash of cold hard truth which struck them dead in the face when "their man" finally had to admit not only that he was playing adolescent sex games in the Oval Office with a ditzy intern, but that he lied to his family, his friends and supporters, the American public and the people of the world about the matter.
<br />   It is hard to save face and maintain any semblance of self respect when you stand hand-in-hand with a couple as disingenous as the Clintons. (This is also the reason that Hollywood is so adamantly against Mr. Bush and anything he is involved with.)
<br />   In their morally-deficient minds, the only way they can regain their status in society and in their own consciences is to prove that all presidents are weak-willed liars and cheats. Just dealing straight-up with the Truth cannot be the answer for them, because it might undermine everything they stand for.
<br />   There is a second, much deeper, reason for the liberal left to attack Dr. Condi Rice, however. The little black girl has not kept in her place. It is okay to become educated and teach, or even to hold a mid-level position in government, but blacks --especially female blacks -- have no place rising to such heights, especially if they are right-thinking.
<br />   The Republicans put the nation at risk to free the blacks from physical slavery and then the Democratic Party worked very hard over the next century to subject them to economic and political slavery by creating a handout subculture for blacks controlled by leaders of their very own race -- who subsequently got rich by staying in their place and keeping their people in subjection.
<br />   Dr. Rice, like Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, chose not to let the bigoted left tell her where her place was -- and thus subjected herself to personal attacks by such "lofty(?)" persons as Kerry, Boxer and Biden.
<br />   I would proscribe a DOSE OF TRUTH for this triumvirate of phonies, but I am afraid it might be too much for them -- maybe it is better to just let them fade away into non-importance in the quagmire of those who would become the "new Clinton" in 2008.</div>
