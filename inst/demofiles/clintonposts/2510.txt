<div>"Senator  Hillary Rodham Clinton, returning to her red-state ties, chastised  Democrats Saturday for taking on issues that arouse conservatives and turn out Republican voters rather than finding consensus on mainstream subjects."  So begins an article in <span>The New York Times</span>.<br />http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/us/16hillary-web.html<br />
<br />That was a sensible statement that Democrats would be wise to heed.<br />
<br />But I wonder if the Senator would agree with me that among the things that  "arouse conservatives and turn out Republican voters" would be  Hillary Rodham Clinton running as the Democratic nominee for President in  08?<br />
