<span>Thoughts about todays's letter from Mike, "It's All About Who You Sleep With ... a Cautionary Note from Michael Moore".</span>
<br />
<br />Heart-wrenching, but necessary. And now soberly, manly done.<br />
<br />I'm not so conceited as to point out that great minds think alike, but I have to admit that the facts do suggest something like that going on between Mike and me... ;)<br />
<br />In his previous letter, a month ago, Mike had quickly mentioned, with ironic serenity, that perseverance in persecution from the right whose effects on the left I was sadly observing at the same time.<br />
<br />Now, from that he infers that it's housecleaning time for us. I can only nod in agreement (that's exactly the work that I did in various places, both online and in real life) - and admire his usual straightforward courage and simplicity in addressing what needs to be, and to whom it may concern, no matter the implicit heartbreak.<br />
<br />Yes, "the real Mike" owns up, and he does so because it's the right time, not because Ralph "Know It All" Nader has ordered him to. The time to bury <span>Lieberman</span>, and to root out the long time disease that has pushed him forward, by naming those who have fed it.<br />
<br />And so Mike names and disowns <span>Kerry and Edwards</span> at last, after jiving us that Kerry was "the #1 Liberal" for so long when he had to.<br />
<br />And so Mike names, disowns and warns <span>Hillary</span>, his all time "secret" impossible love, truthfully putting her at Lieberman's level and calling her "Bush's biggest Democratic supporter of the war", because it's true and because enough is enough.<br />
<br />I fully understand how hard and how painful it has been for him to admit, first to himself and then publicly, the existence and the seriousness of the flaws of those he sleeps with... so that they become warier themselves of their own way of cheating on him. I know how cruel political love stories can be. And I am, once more, delighted by Mike's honesty and refreshed by his righteousness.<br />
<br />Boy, is it more rewarding and pleasant than dealing with Gibson's latest feats.</div>
