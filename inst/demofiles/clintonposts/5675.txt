Tough week last week - <a href="http://daughterchronicles.blogspot.com/2006/08/shooting-up-with-botox.html" target="_blank">Mia got botox injections,</a> and they were both here all the time with less therapy than usual.  I have one more week with both of them before Mia goes back to school, so we'll see if I'm still marginally sane at this time next week.  All of this meant fewer postings after Top Ten Week, but I hope this giant linkdump will make up for it!  It includes some links that are a few weeks old that I never got around to putting up, so I hope you'll forgive me.
