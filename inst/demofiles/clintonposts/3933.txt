<h2>DLC: What Was Your Favorite Moment Of The DLC Era?</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/9/20051/20575"><b><i>DailyKos</i></b></a>' founder <b>Markos Moulitsas</b> sees tough times ahead for the DLC now that they've lost: "two contested primaries in a row, including the loss of their patron saint." Progressive bloggers are in agreement, the DLC is on the run:</p>

<li><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/10/05411/7783"><b><i>DailyKos</i></b></a> diarist <b>Bob Johnson</b>: "Actually, irony may not be the correct term to describe the way the worm has turned for Al From and the DLC acolytes here (who now seem to have disappeared into the Witness Protection Program). Hypocritical liars seems a better fit. Doesn't it?</li>
<li><b>Jonathan Singer</b> at <a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2006/8/10/4140/70647"><b><i>MyDD</i></b></a>: "While we like to blame the <b>Bill Clinton</b> crowd at the DLC for trying to move the Democratic Party to the right in the 1980s and the 1990s, the trend away from 1960s liberalism began -- well -- in the late 1960s and the early 1970s. ...However, with the victory of Ned Lamont this week, the momentum has begun to change. Whereas once the more progressive Senators had to worry about being outflanked to the right -- a sign of the rightward drift of American politics over the past several years -- now overly hawkish and regressive Democrats will have to worry about losing the party base. If ever there were proof of ascendency of progressivism, this is it."</li>
<li><b>Charles P. Pierce</b> at <a href="http://www.prospect.org/weblog/2006/08/post_1093.html#005740"><b><i>TAPPED</i></b></a>: "More than anything else, the DLC created a generation of gun-shy Democrats, and that was fine, as long as we could be reasonably confident that the other side would not throw the entire United States government into the monkeyhouse. Confronted with actual existential threats to the progressive tradition, the Democratic Party looked around after Bill Clinton blew town and found that all its shock troops had melted away. (Indeed, Clinton, that priapic dunderhead, owed his survival in office to the steadfast loyalty of people he'd earlier knuckled for cynical political effect.) This is a good, legitimate argument for a political party to have within itself, and perhaps the best indication of what Feingold's talking about is that at least some very big D's are going to be afraid to engage in it."</li>
