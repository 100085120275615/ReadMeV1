[â¦] This might well be deemed an appropriate date for the apocalyptic ending of Israel and if necessary of the world. It is far from certain that Mr. Ahmadinejad plans any such cataclysmic events precisely for Aug. 22. But it would be wise to bear the possibility in mind.â [Bernard Lewis op-ed, Wall Street Journal, <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110008768">8/8/06</a>]<br /><br />- âWe all hope and pray that August 22 is not the day Ahmadinejad has chosen to launch the apocalypse, but there is little doubt in the White House and at the CIA that the Iranian leader is feverishly trying to build, buy, or steal nuclear weapons, and that he will quite likely use them once he has them.â [Joel Rosenberg, National Review, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NWNmMWM5MjhhMzVjZTM0ZmI1ZmJlYzAxNzU3NDEyMWI=">8/10/06</a>]<br /><br />- âWill [Ahmadinejad] attempt to make good on these threats this year on the anniversary of the Miraj [August 22], illuminating the night sky over Jerusalem?

And Iâm curious to see what happens on Tuesday.

Security Council's five permanent members plus Germany in exchange for halting its uranium enrichment program, Iranian media reported.<br />Iranian TV reported that the response includes an offer to return immediately to serious negotiations on Iran's nuclear program in the coming days, but did not address the sticking point of whether the Islamic republic will put the brakes on its nuclear activities first.<br />The Associated Press reported that officials said Tehran offered a "new formula" to resolve the dispute.

We haven't," Mayfield told Reuters in an interview at the fortress-like hurricane center in Florida.<br /><br />"I think the day is coming. I think eventually we're going to have a very powerful hurricane in a major metropolitan area worse than what we saw in Katrina and it's going to be a mega-disaster.

But when she asked DJs to play songs from her upcoming debut album, "Paris," last spring, she wasn't so confident.<br /><br />"People go crazy," the 25-year-old socialite/reality TV star/singer says in an interview in the September issue of Blender, on newsstands Tuesday. "They love it. Everyone's like, `Who is this?' I don't tell. Because I don't want someone putting their phone up and recording it and making a ring tone off of it.<br /><br />"I think when people don't know it's me, they won't judge it. But if they know it's me, then they'll be like, `Ugh.' They won't even dance."<br /><br />"Paris" the album was set for release Tuesday. Hilton's breathy, reggae-infused single, "Stars Are Blind," has climbed to the top of Billboard's dance music chart.<br /><br /><strong>Of her album, she says, "I, like, cry, when I listen to it, it's so good."</strong></p><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/thenation/20060821/cm_thenation/15114366&amp;printer=1">Gore vs. Clinton in '08? </a><br />The Nation -- The latest Time magazine poll has Al Gore at 41%, right behind Hillary Clinton at 46 percent. (The poll also shows that Clinton remains a polarizing figure--surprise!--among Republicans and a good number of Independents.)<br /><br />Al Gore has warmed up, (see our cover story last June) and is speaking inconvenient truths to stir a nation to take meaningful action about the global climate crisis.<br /><br />And in these last years, Gore finally found an authentic voice--one that seemed to elude him for much of his political career. His early and powerful denunciations of the Bush Administration's war planning and its deceptions, its manipulation of fear, its abuse of power, civil liberties and our constitutional design seem to shift the debate and embolden others to speak out.<br /><br />But, the question remains--will Gore make a run for the presidency in '08? With each passing day, it seems less likely he will. But these latest poll numbers--and, yes, any polling this early has to be viewed skeptically--may just lead Al Gore to make the move.</p>
