<div>My brotherâs favorite phrase is:<br />
<br />Buy the premise, buy the punchline.<br />
<br />The more I think about that, the more I think that is true.<br />
<br />I was forced to blog about it when the other day while watching Newt Gingrich on Fox (yeah, I watch Fox, know your enemy).<br />
<br />He was proclaiming how he and Hillary had developed this bill that would improve record keeping therefore saving 100,000 lives a year. It ticked me off.<br />
<br />Premise number 1, medicine saves lives, as do fireman, policeman and so on. No they donât, occasionally, they extend lives. They defer one form of death until another pops up. As Jim Morrison said, no one gets out of here alive.<br />
<br />I think the conversation needs to be on quality of life, not just how long you live.<br />
<br />Premise number 2, Ethics. We should do this or that. My grandfather taught me this. Mankind cannot do<strong> should</strong> before <strong>can</strong>.<br />
<br />We try everything. No matter how bad, no matter the potential consequence. We knew nuclear weapons were bad, we dropped two anyway.<br />
<br />Ethics comes from experience, direct experience. If you havenât done it, havenât experienced it, do tell people they shouldnât, because they will.<br />
<br />Premise number 3, progress can be stopped. I am making this political but it doesnât have to be. On every issue, there are people that want fast progress, fast progression and those that want slow progression.<br />
<br />Those that want slow progression, if they add value by tempering the issue by stating the issues that arise during the progress, are ok with me. If they turn and say progression is bad or should never happen, well the road of history is littered with bodies of people who did that, even if they are remembered at all.<br />
<br />History is favored by progress. Sorry, but liberalism works. Jesse Helms now looks like a fool. Can you find anyone left who is pro-slavery or against a womanâsâ right to vote? Segregation still ok?<br />
<br />The new progressive issues of the day, abortion, gay rights and marriage, smoking, self-determination, even prisoner rights and sentencing laws will be dealt with. The only issue is how long they take.<br />
<br />The angst some of us feel now on these issues is the same angst our ancestors felt on previous issues. It took courage to adopt progressive ideas and turn them into ideals. Martin Luther King is dead from his personal courage. But it is easier that that. Those that supported progress in the past eventually saw their positions upheld. The same will be required of us. To turn away is to invoke cowardice and support denial.<br />
<br />If you want to temper progress, I will listen. If you want to deny it, stand aside, the tide of humanity will eventually wash you out to sea.<br />
<br />Last premise, evil can be stopped or contained. Life is a duality, we all have good and bad. The nature of civilization is that bad people emerge from time to time. There is no end to the war on terror. It is convenient to call it that, the war on terror but the war on terror therefore goes back, what 1000 years to the invasion of England by Rome, or to the Huns in Europe or maybe to the Vikings descent into France or to Christian invasion of the holy land during the crusades.<br />
<br />Life creates bad guys. This really isnât a war, it is using the name of war, the concept of war to attack bad guys. And not surprisingly, it isnât working. Some history and facts may help<br />
<br />War means state against state. Diplomacy sucked and away we go. Vietnam was a kind of a war. Ever since then, any military action we have taken is really to topple regimes we do not like. Kuwait was really a disaster as all we did was force Saddam to retreat. Now, that was our mandate but a war, no.<br />
<br />Going after the Serbs was to topple them, not take over the country. Panama was about doing what?<br />
<br />No, so sadly, we have allowed our moral fiber to become such that we use our limited military options to aggressively topple dictators we hate. We used to be subtle, now we do it in the open, whether we have the permission of the UN or not.<br />
<br />In WWII we were losing more soldiers in a month, sometimes in a week than we lost in this whole Iraqi overthrow. Imagine 2 million US soldiers killed for the sanctity of Iraq.<br />Bad guys exist but going and declaring it a war is laughable in the long run.<br />
<br />It may actually work but I doubt it in the next 5 years. Forcing self determination has never worked in history. They will have to be left alone to grow it themselves. They will have a civil war on more evident terms that exist today.<br />
<br />And then, we will deal with the next bad guy. We have been doing this since 6,000 BC.<br />
<br />So what premise do you not buy off on?</div>
