<br />
<span>
<span>Well, </span>
<strike> MrsSatan </strike>  <span>Hillary Clinton</span>  <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1153AP_Clinton_Iraq.html" target="_blank">tried looking tough during her questioning of Donald Rumsfeld</a>
<span>.  But Mr. Rumsfeld wouldn't have any part of her grandstanding: </span>
<br />
<br />
</span>
<span>CLINTON</span>
<span>
<span>: "Well, Mr. Secretary, I know you would and I know you feel strongly about it, but there's a track record here. This is not 2002, 2003, 2004-5, when you appeared before this committee and made many comments and presented, you know, many assurances that have frankly proven to be unfulfilled, and..." </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>A grinning <span>Rumsfeld replied</span>, "You're not the boss of me." </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The gallery of attendees chuckled nervously.   </span>
<br />
<br />
</span>   <span>CLINTON continued</span>
<span>
<span>:  "Under your leadership, there have been numerous errors in judgment that have led us to where we are in Iraq and Afghanistan."  </span>
<br />
<br />
</span> <span>RUMSFELD</span>
<span>
<span>:  (Smiling)  "You're not the boss of me." </span>
<br />
<br />
</span> <span>CLINTON</span>
<span>
<span>: "You underestimated the nature and strength of the insurgency, the sectarian violence, and the spread of Iranian influence."   </span>
<br />
<br />
</span> <span>RUMSFELD</span>
<span>
<span>: (Taking a long, dramatic pause) "You're not the boss of me." (Laughter). </span>
<br />
<br />
</span> <span>CLINTON</span>
<span>
<span>:  "We hear a lot of happy talk and rosy scenarios, but because of the administration's strategic blunders - and frankly the record of incompetence in executing - you are presiding over a failed policy.  Given your track record, Secretary Rumsfeld, why should we believe your assurances now?" </span>
<br />
<br />
</span> <span>RUMSFELD</span>
<span>
<span>: (Smirks) "You're not the boss of me!" </span>
