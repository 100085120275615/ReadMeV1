<span>Decker legal bills questioned</span>
</span>
<br />
<br />Winston-Salem attorney David Freedman wouldn't say much about his client, former state Rep. Michael Decker, after Decker declined to testify at the elections board hearing last week, citing his Fifth Amendment right to not self-incriminate.<br />
<br />But the one piece of information Freedman did provide raises questions about how Decker's legal bills are being paid.<br />
<br />Freedman said Decker has retained him for the past "seven or eight months." That's about the same time that House Speaker Jim Black's campaign reports reflect two $5,000 payments to Freedman's law firm -- one on June 16 and the other 11 days later -- for "professional services."<br />

<span>Black campaign broke law, official says</span>
</span>
<br />
<br />A top state elections official said Friday that House Speaker Jim Black or his campaign committee violated state elections laws.<br />
<br />Kim Strach, a deputy elections director who led the investigation into Black's campaign contributions, testified in front of the State Board of Elections that the violations include the campaign's acceptance of nearly $28,000 in illegal corporate contributions; accepting and giving campaign contributions beyond legal limits; and Black's transfer of three checks from optometrists to the campaign of a key ally, then-Rep. Michael Decker.<br />

<br />
<br />A failed ferryboat project along the Outer Banks that has cost state taxpayers nearly $1 million has raised questions of government waste, mismanagement and even criminal wrongdoing.
