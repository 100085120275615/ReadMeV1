<div><p>The next president of the United States will most likely be a democrat. That is unless the Democratic Party (DP) does something foolish. My guess is that after being out of power for eight years, the DP will unite around an &quot;electable&quot; candidate. By electable I mean someone that appeals to the mainstream and has significant leadership experience. </p>

<p>Electability would therefore rule out Senator Hilary Clinton (too much baggage from Bill), Al Gore, and John Kerry.</p>

<p>The DP should nominate either Governor Richardson of New Mexico, Senator Bayh of Indiana, or former Governor Mark Warner from Virginia. Richardson strength is a great deal of experience, he is a Hispanic, and he may have a solution to the &quot;border issue&quot; with Mexico. Bayh has been both a senator and a governor of Indiana and he is from a Red State. He should also have appeal is the 2004 battle ground of Ohio. </p>

<p>Warner, from a Southern Red State, was very popular when he left office and could cause problem for fellow Virginian George Allen who may seek the Republican Party presidential nomination. Also of interest, it was recently announced that his chosen&nbsp; successor, Tim Kaine, will deliver the DP response to President W's State of the Union address. </p>

<p>The DP can screw up like John Kerry did. Kerry, an absolute and complete idiot, chose John Edwards as his candidate for VP. This brain dead decision lost the election for Kerry who should have nominated someone that could carry his own homestate. This would mean a Bayh or Warner would be great VP options. </p>

<p>Realistically, the Republicans have few players to choose from. There are two options, Senator John &quot;Its all about me&quot; McCain and Senator George Allen. McCain should be the favorite but he is elderly and not popular with conservatives. His cause has been helped by Pat Robertson, a political foe. Over recent weeks Robertson has made a fool of himself over and over again. Robertson not longer has the sway with social conservatives that he used to have, thus increase McCain's chances. </p>

<p>My prediction for 2008 is McCain V. Richardson.</p>
