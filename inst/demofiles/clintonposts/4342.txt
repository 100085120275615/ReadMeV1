<p><strong>24</strong><br />
Tomorrow marks my 24th year of life. For the first time I can remember, I can truly say that I am happy. I am no longer thinking of my life as a journey to happinessâ¦no more thoughts of <em>I&#8217;ll be happy when I accomplish this or achive that</em>.Â Iâm not happy just because something good happened to me recently. I didn&#8217;tÂ find Mr. Right,Â get aÂ new job, or sign a dealÂ with G-Unitâ¦Iâm happy just&#8230; because.</p>
<p>I still kinda feel like a kid but my little sister &#038; brother always find a way to remind me that Iâm indeed getting older. We were sitting around watching the video soul channel and En Vogueâs âHold Onâ came on. Iâve had this song as a ring tone for a while so that when family members call I know not to pick up my phone hehe. Anyway, I was all excited when the video came on and my brother was like âdo we HAVE to watch this OLD video???â Then he said âheeeey&#8230;thatâsÂ the same song you have on your phone! I didnât know WHAT that was!â I was stuck. En Vogue is to him what Rick James is to me. When did this happen?</p>
<p><strong>Channel Surfing</strong><br />
I was watching TV Land last night (as usual) and an episode from the first season of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air came on. It was the episode where Ice Tray (played by Don Cheadle â itâs amazing how actors start out) came to visit Will from Philly. During Trayâs stay at the house he managed to get cozy with Hillary. Tray hustled fake Louis Vuitton bags for a living which caused Aunt Viv and Uncle Phil to damn near have strokes. They also tried to impress upon Will the importance of education so he wouldnât end up in the 10th grade for three years like Tray. Will goes on to talk about how he used to get beat up for walking home from school with books.Â One day heÂ stashed hisÂ books in a pizza box but unfortunately some dudes tried to rob him for his âpizzaâ only to be disappointed. HeÂ went on saying that Tray used to protect him because he got picked on for being interested in school.</p>
<p>I hear people say that itâs not acceptable to be intelligent and interested in school in the âhood. But do kids really get beat up for carrying books home or getting a good test scores? Nerds get teased in every community regardless of race. I felt as though this episode exaggerated the truth. I attended some of the ghettoest (new word hehe)Â  schools in this city and have never had to hide books or worry about getting beat up for doing well in school. Thatâs really over the top. Maybe it&#8217;s different for males?</p>
<p><strong>Good Man/Nice Guy</strong><br />
Those terms are thrown around too loosely. Lately when I meet a guy he slips âIâm a good manâ and âIâm a nice guyâ into the conversation every chance he can get. I asked one guy if he was trying to convince himself, me, or both? A good man doesnât have to consistently remind people that heâs greatâ¦he just is.</p>
<p>Who determined the criteria to be labeled a good guy? A co-worker told me thatÂ since heÂ goes home every night, has a job, and doesn&#8217;t beat his live-in baby-mama he&#8217;s a good man despite the fact that he cheats on her consistently.Â WTF???</p>
<p><strong>Youâre FIRED</strong><br />
Iâm so happy that St.ar got fired. I listened to his show sometimes and I thought of it as satire and didnât take it seriously. To say that youâll <a href="http://www.hiphopmusic.com/archives/001845.html" target="_blank">&#8220;do an &#8216;R.Kelly&#8217;&#8221;</a> to your rivalâs 4 year old daughter is someÂ ignorant shit. We all know that heâll pop up 6 months from now with a new morning show on another station (probably here in Philly)Â the same way that R. Kelly is now selling out stadiums (recently sold-out here actually) despite being a pedophile. As a previous listener to his show I know the context in which he speaks and am sure he didn&#8217;t mean that he&#8217;d literally molest a child but still there&#8217;s some shit that you just don&#8217;t say! EspeciallyÂ on live radio with millions of people listening across 5-6 states.</p>
<p>Iâm SICK of Nyc radio jocks. Iâd much rather listen to a morning show thatâs local and connected to the community which it serves.</p>
<p>Philly always gets stuck with Nyc radio DJ throwbacks. When Wendy Williams got fired from Hot 97 back in the day she came here. Same w/ Miss Jones. Why do we have to get Nycâs sloppy seconds? After all the hoopla dies down they run right back to Nyc anyway. Philly gets no respect!
