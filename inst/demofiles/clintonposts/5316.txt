Good news! The Senate voted yesterday 84-16 to pass the pro-gun<br />Vitter amendment.<br /><br />The language, offered by Sen. David Vitter (R-LA) as an amendment to<br />the Homeland Security appropriations bill (HR 5441), will make it<br />illegal for federal agents to confiscate firearms during an emergency<br />or major disaster. The provision must now survive a conference<br />committee -- where House and Senate negotiators will iron out<br />differences between the spending bills passed in both chambers.<br /><br />If the Vitter language makes it to the President's desk, it will<br />perfectly complement what has been happening in the states. This<br />year, one of GOA's highest priorities has been to address the<br />problems with so-called "emergency powers" across the country.<br /><br />GOA-supported bills have made it absolutely certain that no<br />government official could disarm the citizenry during an emergency,<br />and several states -- ten in all -- have already enacted their bills<br />into law.<br /><br />Sen. Vitter, who less than a month ago was presented with the<br />Legislator of the Year award by Gun Owners of America, made special<br />mention of this groundswell of support that has been rising around<br />the country. It was especially significant that his own state of<br />Louisiana recently enacted a ban on confiscating firearms -- an<br />action taken to correct the gun thefts which occurred there in the<br /><!-- D(["mb","aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />GOA spent a lot of time in Louisiana, getting gun owners in the state<br />to lobby their own legislators this spring. The results were<br />astounding.<br /><br />The sponsor of the Emergency Protection legislation in the state,<br />Rep. Steve Scalise, told GOA that, &quot;I\'ve had a number of<br />[Representatives] come up to me asking to co-author my bill because<br />they heard from members of Gun Owners of America in their districts<br />in support of my bill,&quot; Scalise said. In the end, 80% of the House<br />cosponsored his bill.<br /><br />If you have ever wondered if your activism makes a difference, then<br />wonder no more.<br /><br />One U.S. Senate office told GOA after yesterday\'s vote, &quot;They<br />obviously got your message loud and clear. It was the most lopsided<br />gun vote I have ever seen. There was some serious hand wringing on<br />the democratic side.&quot;<br /><br />Why was there &quot;serious hand wringing&quot;? Because your efforts made it<br />VERY difficult for anti-gun Democrats to vote against the Vitter<br />language.<br /><br />Again, there were only 16 Senators who voted wrong. If you look at<br />GOA\'s Senate rating -- at <a>http://www.gunowners.org<wbr>/109srat.htm</a> --<br />you\'ll see a lot more than just 16 F\'s in that chamber.<br /><br />So who were the Senators who were arrogant enough to stand by their<br />anti-gun convictions and vote against this common-sense legislation?<br />They were:<br /><br />Akaka (D-HI)<br />Boxer (D-CA)<br />Clinton (D-NY)<br />Dodd (D-CT)<br />Durbin (D-IL)<br />Feinstein (D-CA)<br />Harkin (D-IA)<br />Inouye (D-HI)<br />Kennedy (D-MA)<br />Lautenberg (D-NJ)<br />Levin (D-MI)<br />Menendez (D-NJ)<br />Mikulski (D-MD)<br />Reed (D-RI)<br />Sarbanes (D-MD)<br />Schumer (D-NY)<br /><br />Basically, these senators said that when your life is in danger, you<br />don\'t have the right to defend yourself.
