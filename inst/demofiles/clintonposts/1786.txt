</a>Ok, I had this weird idea about interrelatedness and women in politics.<br />
<br />See, there is this Dutch party I always vote for (except with local elections), and, almost four years ago, I voted for this lady who was talked about as being destined to become the new leader of the party in time. Today, precisely such a person was chosen, but IT WASN'T HER! <a href="http://www.risdonfoto.com/CR%20Web%20Photos/Events/Hillary%20Witch.jpg">

<br />She was one of the two main candidates, but she did not get the majority of the votes. Some guy won who is our current minister of state (kingdom) affairs.<br />There is another lady who is talked about as being destined to become the new leader of the party, and I fear now that she will be voted away as well (course, this is a totally irrational fear and the two situations are completely different).<br />
<br />I hope it's not prophetic. <strong>I want the witch to reign</strong>.</div>
