<p>2006 SENATE RACE RANKINGS<br />
Watch Ohio&#8230;<br />
Last updated: Aug. 2, 2006 </p>
	<p>The Democratic Senate targets can be divided into three groups: Group 1 (PA, MT, RI) is immune from the national climate as the incumbents themselves are the issue. Group 2 (OH, MO) is all about the national environment (and in Ohio&#8217;s case, the state environment). Group 3 (AZ, TN, VA) is comprised of the longshot races which need significant Republican pain to break. So what&#8217;s the bottom line? If the polls we&#8217;re seeing are accurate, Republicans will hold the Senate by a seat or two at best. </p>
	<p>Things would have to get much worse for the GOP for Senate control to be in play. But never say never; there&#8217;s every chance that once the campaign begins in full, the tilted playing field in favor of Democrats nationally could get a whole lot better. Republicans, though, would love to believe that this is as bad as it will get. </p>
	<p>As always, I&#8217;ve asked Hotline State Editor Quinn McCord for an assist on the Senate rankings. Agree or disagree? Let us know. And as always, you can rank the top 10 races yourself, alongside ours. - Chuck Todd</p>

	<p> Rank<br />
  State<br />
  Incumbent/Party<br />
 Previous  </p>
	<p> 1<br />
 PENNSYLVANIA<br />
 Rick Santorum (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 1 </p>
	<p> Santorum&#8217;s folks are tacitly acknowledging that their path to 50 percent is nearly impossible, which explains why they want a Green Party candidate on the ballot. If this is a race to 48 percent, rather than 50, then the likelihood of a GOP victory becomes a bit more realistic. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 2<br />
 MONTANA<br />
 Conrad Burns (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 2 </p>
	<p> What&#8217;s the over/under on the number of verbal gaffes by Burns between now and Election Day? The firefighter attack is just the latest clue that this campaign will never be about anybody other than the incumbent &#8212; and that&#8217;s a big problem for the Republicans. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 3<br />
 RHODE ISLAND<br />
 Lincoln Chafee (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 4 </p>
	<p> Kudos to Stu Rothenberg for doing some digging on the significance (or lack thereof) of the nearly 14,000 voters who switched from being Democrats to independents. The Chafee camp had no problem letting us think that these voter registration switches were all about helping Chafee in the GOP primary. Rothenberg made a compelling case that it was just standard process. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 4<br />
 OHIO<br />
 Mike DeWine (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 6 </p>
	<p> Ohio and Missouri are the Dem target states that are all about the national environment. When Bush and the GOP are hurting nationally, DeWine and Talent feel it the most. So why does Ohio rise on our list? Because Bush is dropping again at the polls. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 5<br />
 MISSOURI<br />
 Jim Talent (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 3 </p>
	<p> If this race were fought in a vacuum, Talent comes out ahead. He has the superior campaign operation; he has superior financial resources; and he has a few intangibles (a growing party base, a dispirited and sometimes divided Democratic Party). But Talent&#8217;s No. 1 enemy is the climate, pure and simple. He can beat McCaskill in the campaign and still lose the election. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 6<br />
 WASHINGTON<br />
 Maria Cantwell (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 7 </p>
	<p> Win or lose, McGavick has already helped the national GOP by forcing Democrats to spend money to hold a seat. The more dollars the Democrats have to send here (or to Maryland, New Jersey or even Minnesota), the fewer resources they have for Tennessee or Virginia. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 7<br />
 MINNESOTA<br />
 Open Seat (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 5 </p>
	<p> We can&#8217;t ignore two different polls coming out within days of each other showing Klobuchar with a significant, double-digit lead. Still, we don&#8217;t expect this race to be a blowout. But time&#8217;s running short and Kennedy&#8217;s got a daunting, dual-track task ahead of him: (1) Get distance from Bush, and (2) make Klobuchar unacceptable. It&#8217;s possible, but&#8230; Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 8<br />
 MARYLAND<br />
 Open Seat (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 9 </p>
	<p> Steele had himself a week. Welcome to the big leagues, lieutenant governor. Still, either Cardin or Mfume is going to be broke after the primary, which will give Steele a head start for the general. Is that enough? This is Maryland, after all. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 9<br />
 NEW JERSEY<br />
 Robert Menendez (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 8 </p>
	<p> Is it just us, or are Democrats more nervous about this race than Republicans are optimistic? We were mildly surprised to see New Jersey on the initial round of ad buys by the DSCC. Every dollar Democrats spend here is good news for Mitch McConnell&#8217;s ambitions to become the next Senate majority leader. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 10<br />
 NEBRASKA<br />
 Ben Nelson (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 12 </p>
	<p> In our minds, there is a BIG dropoff between the No. 9 slot and the No. 10 slot in these rankings. Starting with this race and continuing through Michigan (No. 14), the contests are fairly interchangeable. They are all relative long shots; Nebraska is atop this group because of Ricketts&#8217; resources. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 11<br />
 TENNESSEE<br />
 Open Seat (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 11 </p>
	<p> The DSCC is putting its money where its mouth is by placing TV ad buys here. We should get a better feel for this race after the primary. Will Corker blow out the GOP field or limp to victory? Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 12<br />
 ARIZONA<br />
 Jon Kyl (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 10 </p>
	<p> Many Republicans are starting to express relief about this race. They know Kyl is vulnerable, and they know Pederson has deep pockets. But Pederson&#8217;s TV ads are tame, and he&#8217;s probably going to need to heave a Hail Mary or two if he wants to change the dynamics of this race. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 13<br />
 VIRGINIA<br />
 George Allen (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 13 </p>
	<p> Why can&#8217;t Allen break 50 percent? Why is this race teetering still? Simple: demographics. Need hard evidence that Virginia is no longer a red state? Just look at the latest Mason-Dixon poll question on a gay-marriage ban. Not surprisingly, the ban is favored. What is surprising? It&#8217;s favored by just 18 points (56 percent to 38 percent). Those are Michigan numbers on gay marriage, not Georgia numbers. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 14<br />
 MICHIGAN<br />
 Debbie Stabenow (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 14 </p>
	<p> We get the sense the national GOP desperately wants to play here, but only if Bouchard is their nominee. After running a decent preseason campaign, it looks like these final few weeks are going to be rough on the nominal front-runner. Butler&#8217;s making it a race. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 15<br />
 WEST VIRGINIA<br />
 Robert Byrd (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 15 </p>
	<p> Since a debate probably won&#8217;t happen, Raese had better be assembling some carefully crafted TV ads to run. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 16<br />
 NEVADA<br />
 John Ensign (R)<br />
 Last Ranking: 16 </p>
	<p> Is Carter playing too nice? It&#8217;s August, and he still hasn&#8217;t engaged Ensign. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 17<br />
 FLORIDA<br />
 Bill Nelson (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 17 </p>
	<p> A year ago, Harris was thought to be invincible in a primary against a non-statewide officeholder. But today? Not really. By the way, any generic Republican not named Harris probably can get 45 percent. Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 18<br />
 VERMONT<br />
 Open Seat (I)<br />
 Last Ranking: 18 </p>
	<p> Tarrant polling at 35 percent: $3.6 million. Tarrant beating Sanders: priceless? Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 19<br />
 CONNECTICUT<br />
 Joseph Lieberman (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 19 </p>
	<p> Has any Senate primary ever gotten this much national coverage? Tip Sheet </p>
	<p> 20<br />
 HAWAII<br />
 Daniel Akaka (D)<br />
 Last Ranking: 20 </p>
	<p> Akaka seems in better shape than he did a few months ago. Do the &#8220;I&#8217;s&#8221; (Iraq/Inouye) have it for him? Case needs some serious outside help because Akaka is getting institutional support that is proving to be very helpful. Tip Sheet </p>
