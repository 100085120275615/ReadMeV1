<div>Martin Peretz, editor in chief of The New Republic, has just screwed up his life. He just <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050627&s=diarist062705">
<strong>wrote and published</strong> </a>an editorial that praises President Bush. That's right, the Lefty just praised the evil President for putting appointments where his heart/mouth are and putting real diversity in the Executive Branch (like Condi Rice). He also mentioned that it wasn't just blacks getting the appointments, it was also for women and Latinos.<br />
<br />And if that wouldn't put him in the dog house long enough with his compadre's, he also took a few swipes at the U.N. (Darfur, Darfur anyone, Bueller?), and had good things to say about John Bolton. Namely, that he didn't trust what a CIA analyst had to say (he called it a sign of "wisdom").<br />
<br />To make sure he wouldn't get invited to anything anytime soon, he took a swipe at Hillary. Yes, as in the smartest women in the world and our future president, Hillary Clinton. He called her out for sitting on the Board of Directors of Walmart, and doing nothing while Walmart structured itself so it did not pay medical benefits to its labor force.<br />
<br />Poor guy.<br />
<br />I'm sure he'll manage.</div>
