<br />ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE ANDREW CUOMO, BROOKLYN SENIORS, ELECTED LEADERS PLEDGE TO FIGHT FOR SENIORS BY CRACKING DOWN ON FRAUD AND OBSTACLES TO HEALTHCARE .<br />
<br />Brooklyn Seniors, Assemblywoman Joan Millman, State Senator Martin Connor, NYC Council Member Bill DeBlasio and Fmr. Council Member Steven DiBrienza Praise Cuomoâs Record of Fighting Fraud and Protecting Seniors.<br />
<br />Brooklyn, NY (August 24, 2006) â New York State Attorney General candidate Andrew Cuomo today stood with a coalition of Brooklyn seniors and elected leaders pledging to fight to crack down on the fraud, confusion and obstacles caused by the Bush administrationâs new prescription drug benefit program called Medicare Part D.<br />
<br />At an event at the Eileen Dugan Senior Center in Brooklyn, New York seniors and Brooklyn elected leaders including New York State Assemblywoman Joan Millman, New York State Senator Martin Connor, New York City Council Member Bill DeBlasio and former Council Member Steven DiBrienza endorsed Cuomo praising his lifelong record fighting fraud, protecting seniors from scam artists and standing up to powerful special interests. The coalition lauded Cuomoâs plans to stand up for seniors.<br />
<br />Cuomo pledged to create a Senior Citizen Protection Unit in the NYS AG's Health Care Bureau which will monitor, investigate and prosecute any entity or individual that fraudulently advertises, mismanages (i.e. overbilling), or exploits the confusion surrounding the new Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit program.<br />
<br />âAndrew Cuomo will be New York's next Attorney General because of his outstanding record of results, his integrity and his proven record of commitment to stand for all of us" said Assemblywoman Joan Millman. âBased on Andrewâs past performance and his vision, Andrew Cuomo will be seniorsâ and all New Yorkersâ best advocate. From founding HELP, the nationâs largest private provider of transitional housing for the homeless to serving in President Clintonâs cabinet where he turned around a deeply troubled agency, stood up to scam artists threatening to rob seniors of their savings and battled the gun lobby, New Yorkers need a fighter to protect our families and Attorney General Cuomo will be there for all of us.â<br />
<br />âAndrew Cuomo is far and away the best qualified to succeed Eliot Spitzer because of his lifetime of accomplishments fighting for seniors and for all New Yorkers,â said New york State Senator Martin Connor. âNo other candidate can match Andrewâs record of results taking on the big fights on behalf of seniors and working and middle class families. Serving President Clinton, Andrew took on the KKK and cracked down on predatory lenders. Andrew has been a crusader for justice his entire life. His long-standing achievements and passion to fight for us make him our choice for Attorney General.â<br />
<br />âToday is a great day for our campaign,â said Andrew Cuomo, candidate for New York State Attorney General. âI am proud to have the support of these outstanding leaders. As Attorney General, I would be honored to partner with them to stand up for seniors who are being preyed upon by scam artists and taken advantage of. I will stand up to the federal government when it fails our seniors and families, as it is doing now with Medicare Part D. I look forward to fighting to restore integrity to our government and protecting working and middle class families and taxpayers from the special interests that put profits over people. I will be New Yorkersâ toughest advocate.â<br />
<br />NYS ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE ANDREW CUOMO EARNS ENDORSEMENT OF THE CITIZENS UNION.<br />
<br />100-Year-Old New York Government Reform Watchdog Organization Praises Cuomoâs Record of Results and Vision for Reforming Albany.<br />
<br />New York, NY (August 24, 2006) â New York State Attorney General candidate Andrew Cuomo today received the endorsement of Citizens Union, a non partisan issue organization that has promoted good government and political reform in the city and state of New York for more than a century. Citizens Union has been a leading progressive force and watchdog for the public interest and advocate of the common good.<br />
<br />In its endorsement, Citizens Union highlighted Cuomoâs record successfully reforming and turning around the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development where he supervised 350 attorneys and managed more than 12,000 employees. The Citizens Union praised Cuomoâs vision and proposals for cleaning up Albany in several areas including: fighting Medicaid fraud, campaign finance reform, redistricting reform and aggressively using the Tweed Law which brings suit to recover any governmental funds that have been âwithout right obtainedâ as a means for fighting political corruption, policing unethical or fraudulent behavior, and enacting political reform.<br />
<br />âAndrew Cuomo earned our preference on the strength of his record in managing and reforming a large government agency like HUD, the way in which he articulates his vision for the office of Attorney General, including his specific ideas on how to pursue both Medicaid fraud and official malfeasance, and the commitments he made on a host of reforms like campaign finance and ethics,â said Dick Dadey, Executive Director of Citizens Union. âWe felt that of the four worthy Democratic candidates, he is best equipped to manage the stateâs Department of Law and bring innovation to the Attorney Generalâs officeâ¦in the end, we felt that Andrew Cuomo would be better able to accomplish what needs to be done in the critical issues confronting the stateâ¦We believe that Cuomo has better experience and a stronger record of accomplishment than either of them.â [See text of the rest of endorsement below.]<br />
<br />âToday is a great day for our campaign,â said Andrew Cuomo New York State attorney general candidate. âFor more than a century, Citizens Union has been a strong, progressive voice for change and good government in New York. I am proud to have this critical support for our campaign which is focused on standing up for all New Yorkers and making government work for everyone.â<br />
<br />Support for Cuomo<br />
<br />Citizens Union believes that Cuomoâs experience supervising 12,000 employees and 350 attorneys while serving as HUD Secretary under President Bill Clinton while bringing reform to a troubled and corrupt agency prepares him for the office of Attorney General. With specific ideas on reforming state government and practical proposals, Cuomo demonstrated that he has been thinking about these issues in concrete ways that attend specifically to the role and place of the Attorney General in the government structure. His record of accomplishment founding and leading the non profit Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged (HELP) and working at the Housing and Urban Development federal agency makes us hopeful that he has the managerial skills and experience to attain these goals.<br />
<br />Two key measures to combat the dysfunction in Albany, according to Cuomo, are campaign finance and redistricting reform. He argues that these two measures will make elections more competitive and in turn bring about more accountability to government and better qualified elected officials. Cuomoâs proposal to reform how campaigns are financed includes a limited public financing system, much like New York Cityâs, a ban on soft money contributions, a $10,000 limit on contributions to political parties, a $300 limit on contributions from corporations doing business with state, a moratorium on contributions from pharmaceutical companies doing business with the state, and other measures. He also supports a ban on elected officials accepting of honoraria or fees for public speaking engagements and other events, as well as a three year âcooling offâ period before an elected or appointed official of the executive or legislative branch can lobby the state government.<br />
<br />Cuomo would more aggressively enforce the Tweed Law which brings suit to recover any governmental funds (state or local) that have been âwithout right obtainedâ as the way in which to fight political corruption, police unethical or fraudulent behavior, and enact political reform. He believes that simply enforcing the law will bring dramatic results.<br />
<br />If elected, Cuomo would also push for a comprehensive healthcare reform package including a crackdown on fraud and abuse in the pharmaceutical and insurance industries and more active policing of Medicare to protect seniors. Cuomo believes that Medicaid fraud is wide and that encouraging whistleblowers to come forward under the federal false claims act will bring greater compliance. Citizens Union was also pleased to see Cuomo stress the need to partner with local district attorneys in addressing systemic enforcement issues such as Medicaid fraud and his interest in continuing Spitzerâs work with other state attorneys general in protecting the environment at a time when the federal government has adopted a more laissez-fair approach.<br />
<br />NYS ATTORNY GENERAL CANDIDATES ANDREW CUOMO AND CHARLIE KING PLAN TO PARTICIPATE IN TOWN HALL FORUM<br />
<br />New York, NY (August 24, 2006)âFollowing up on their conversation in last weekâs debate, Andrew Cuomo and Charlie King are planning to participate in a town hall community forum to discuss issues of importance to minority communities.   Cuomo sent a letter accepting Mr. Kingâs invitation.  (Text of notes from Andrew to follow.)<br />
<br />August 24, 2006<br />
<br />Mr. Charlie King<br />Charlie King for Attorney General<br />48 Wall Street, 4th Floor<br />New York, NY  10005<br />
<br />Dear Charlie,<br />
<br />I accept your proposal.  As we have discussed personally, I have spent two years speaking with New Yorkers about the challenges and problems facing them and my ideas to help address those issues as Attorney General.  The negative, political tactics wind up turning off voters and discouraging political participation.  The issues of the minority community have always been a priority for me. <br />
<br />I welcome the opportunity for a positive, substantive discussion.<br />
<br />Letâs plan on next week and find a community forum in Brooklyn, if that works for you. <br />
<br />Best personal regards,<br />
<br />Andrew M. Cuomo<br />
<br />August 22, 2006<br />
<br />Andrew Cuomo<br />1740 Broadway, 8th floor<br />New York, NY 10019<br />
<br />Dear Andrew,<br />
<br />Thank you for agreeing to join me at a Town Hall meeting to discuss the issue of race.  In order to avoid any confusion, I amplify my proposal as follows:<br />
<br />A one hour discussion between you and me during the week of August 28th in Brooklyn or Harlem on the issues surrounding race, ethnicity and immigration.<br />
<br />While there certainly will be issue differences between us, there will be no personal attacks by either of us. <br />
<br />Each of us can make an opening statement, and then we will address four predetermined questions agreed to by both you and me.<br />
<br />For the remainder of the hour, you and I will take questions from the audience.  Questions will be written out by the audience in advance of being asked and can only be asked if approved by both campaigns.<br />
<br />Both campaigns will work to line up as many sponsors of the Town Hall Meeting as possible from community of color newspapers, radio stations, institutions, clergy, etc.<br />
<br />The goal here is to have an in-depth and positive discussion and debate on these critical issues. <br />
<br />I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.<br />
<br />                        Thanks,<br />
<br />                        Charlie</div>
