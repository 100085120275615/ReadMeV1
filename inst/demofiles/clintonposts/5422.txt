In the 1980âs two key political events occurred which shaped my view of the Democrat party for life.<br /><br />One was the attack on Oliver North during the Democrat sideshow called "Iran Contra".<br /><br />North cleaned the Democratâs clock on national TV and also became an America hero in the process. His standing up to the immature attacks by liberals accusing him of crimes was hysterical, since he already had an immunity agreement, and because he showed what a U.S. Marine was, the perfect weapon against Communists and Democrats. The more North talked and defended his actions against the Latin American Communist invasions of the 1980âs the more it became clear he was defending the United States, not attacking it like the Democrats were.<br /><br />The other key event was the Robert Bork Supreme Court hearings.<br /><br />The liberal Democrats, led by Ted "letâs take a waterfront drive" Kennedy and Joe "Can I copy that paper?" Biden went full speed ahead with a personal and professional attack on Bork.<br /><br />The libs looked into Borkâs movie rental history, his tax returns, his driving record and his 1st grade report card, all in the attempt to prevent him from being on the Supreme Court. (His video rental history included <em>A Day at the Races, Ruthless</em> <em>People</em> and <em>The Man Who Knew Too Much</em>---and the very fact that I know this information, because of Democrat slime, led to the law that prevents release of rental histories).<br /><br />There was no way the left was going to let a right-wing judge who believed in original intent of the U.S. Constitution onto the Supreme Court.<br /><br />Bork told the hearings that he would not legislate from the bench. Which to libs meant he would not support the loony laws they wanted to put in place. They had to stop him any way possible.<br /><br />The liberals in the Senate succeeded in defeating the Bork nomination after a relentless attack on national TV and in the liberal media that made this great jurist seem like an extremist.<br /><br />One Democrat Senator said he could never vote for a judge, "with a beard like that".<br /><br />Ted Kennedyâs told the American people, "Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, children could not be taught about evolution."<br /><br />None of that was ever true about Bork, but the damage was done. And the term BORKING entered the lexicon. (Judge Bork was once asked how it felt to be a verb after noted feminist Florence Kennedy addressed a National Organization Of (Liberal) Woman conference on the importance of defeating the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court.<br />She said, "We're going to bork him."<br /><br />Remember the Clarence Thomas fiasco?<br />Coke cans and sex talk?<br />All because of a made up charge of sexual harassment by a woman who followed him from job to job. That Borking failed because the Senate saw it for what it was--- yet another liberal sideshow.<br /><br />Justice Thomas has been a great member of the Court and Roberts would be also,<br />except now the liberals in the Senate want to Bork Judge John Roberts.<br /><br />After President Bush picked Roberts as his nominee many in the media and politics were saying what an easy confirmation he would have.<br />He is well liked, respected and has a great resume, a shoo-in for the Court.<br /><br />But the loony liberal groups in D.C. have a different idea.<br /><br />After President Bush stupidly released 75,000 documents from Robertâs years in the Reagan and Bush I administrations the liberal groups went on the attack this week.<br /><br />First up is the cry that Roberts is anti-environment.<br /><br />Ted Kennedy is saying that the Roberts wrote a dissent in a legal case that threatens, "Social Security, Medicare and the minimum wage" , as well as the environment.<br />The case involved a real estate company that sued to stop the Interior Department from blocking a development because a supposed "endangered" frog lived on the land. <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4258/393/1600/frog.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4258/393/320/frog.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /><br />Judge Roberts contended correctly that this was not INTERstate Commerce under Federal jurisdiction, but actually INTRAstate Commerce, since the frog never leaves the State Of California.<br /><br />If a liberal lawyer had used this common sense in a court case to steal someoneâs land Ted Kennedy would be cheering, but since the case pointed out how dumb and outrageous the Endangered Species Act has become , he is upset and thinks this means the Commerce Clause and the power of Big Government is being attacked.<br /><br />Another case the loony left is attacking Roberts on is his view of Title IX.<br />The liberals want you to believe Roberts is anti-woman because of his views on this law.<br /><br />In case you donât know, Title IX is the horrible law that states:<br /><em>"No person in the U.S. shall, on the basis of sex be excluded from participation in, or denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational program or activity receiving federal aid."</em><br /><br />Why is this horrible?<br />Because when this law was passed in 1972 it was NOT designed to have the unintended consequences we see today. Liberal judges over the years have said this law means menâs sports teams on colleges can be closed if woman want to form an important sport, say like equestrian or volleyball.<br /><br />The menâs Gold Medal winning Olympic wrestling team at UCLA was disbanded because of this misguided law. So have countless other menâs sports teams.<br /><br />I once got in an argument with a woman in a hotel bar in Daytona Beach during NASCAR Speedweeks about Title IX and how it was destroying college sports for men.<br />Her attitude was "Who cares. Women deserve to play whatever sports they want to even if they donât make money for the schools like football does."<br />When I told her that the way the law was being read would soon mean funding for sports would be based on the <em>population</em> of women in the college regardless of how many women actually <em>played</em> sports she got upset and said I was lying about how the law was being interpreted.<br />This got about three other men involved telling her how their sons were losing sports teams at colleges due to Title IX. The woman and her husband were very angry now that we had upset their perfect liberal thinking and they left the bar.<br /><br />Low and behold, the courts have recently ruled that Title IX demands funding for womenâs sports based on student population, regardless of how many woman actually play sports.<br /><br />Which brings me back to Judge Roberts.<br /><br />The left is all upset because Roberts once stated that Title IX does NOT cover sports that receive no federal funding, that the law only covers events and programs that actually <em>receive </em>federal funds. This is heresy to the radical feminists and Ted Kennedy.<br /><br />I guess Kennedy figures if Mary Jo Kopechne had been a swimmer in college she would have survived Chappaquiddick. (Think this is out of line? Read this site to learn what really happened at Chappaquiddick -- http://www.ytedk.com/chapter1.htm)<br /><br />Title IX has been a sacred cow for the left since 1972, and they will scream and rant all day long if they think Roberts would overturn the whacko parts of it in the Supreme Court.<br /><br />I hope he does help overturn this UNFAIR and SEXIST law.<br /><br />The libs are also upset that Roberts is, ------HORRORS!!!!!------a member of<br />The Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers organization. The Federalists are hated by the left since they have changed the whole legal outlook in this country. Who ever heard of Tort Reform or Original Intent before 1982, the year the Federalist Society was founded?<br /><br />The worst attacks on Roberts though are on his religion.<br />The liberals are screaming that since he is a Catholic, attends Mass and has a wife who is a member of a pro-life group that that DISQUALIFIES him from sitting on the court.<br /><br />See how evil the Democrat party can be?<br />Letâs attack the religion and the wife of the nominee to get to him.<br />(Funny, I wasnât aware Roberts' wife was nominated for anything).<br /><br />This is a religious litmus test worse than the abortion litmus test the libs demand.<br />The left want Roberts to say how he would rule on abortion cases even though NO Supreme Court nominee has ever had to in the past.<br /><br />This is called the "Ginsburg Standard", named after Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. During her confirmation hearings in 1993 Ginsburg refused to answer any of the Republicanâs questions on issue saying that, "I will give no hints, previews or forecasts".<br /><br />But now Senator Chucky Schumer demands that Roberts answer any and all questions about all issues. No doubt it is fair now since a Republican is up for the court.<br /><br />You see in the liberal world of Borking all is fair.<br /><br />The difference now though is that the left is, thankfully, useless and powerless in this court battle.<br /><br /><strong>The</strong> <strong>Republicans control the Senate nowâ¦.not Ted Kennedy.</strong><br /><strong>President Bush runs the nomination process----not Hillary Clinton. </strong><br /><strong>Foxnews will get the viewers for the hearings in SeptemberâNot CNN, and the commentary will be fair and balanced, not AARAAT---Attack Any Republican At Any Time.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>In Matworld Judge Roberts gets a fair hearing without Borking or talk about Coke cans and he enters the court in October ready to correct the mistakes the Supreme Court has been making for 40 years.<br /></strong><br />Then President Bush gets two more judges to pick and we sensible and correct conservatives get to return the Supreme Court to what the Founding Fathers wanted it to be,<br />one of the three branches of government, not the final dictator of liberal social policy.<br /><br />MTI<br /><br /><a href="mailto:CEPAN@aol.com">CEPAN@aol.com</a><br /><br />Mat Toenniessen<br /><br /></strong>
