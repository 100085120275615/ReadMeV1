I don't normally spend much time on any of the really fringe left-wing sites because, honestly, they are a waste of time.  I outgrew comic books when I was about twelve years old and that's what sites like Daily Kos, MoveOn.org and that Huffington thing remind me of...cartoons aimed at empty adolescent minds.<br /><br />That said, I've been aware of the hatchet job that this Markos guy managed to do on Joe Lieberman because of all the national publicity that Lieberman's primary defeat received from the national media.  I even saw the television ad in which the girlishly enthusiastic little Kos himself appeared with Ned Lamont, Lieberman's primary opponent.  The thrust of all of this is that Kos and his pals wanted to run Lieberman out of the Democrat Party for good and they didn't really care how they did it.  Lieberman irritated their Democrat "sensibilities" because he dared to openly agree with George W. Bush's policies on Iraq.  The fact that Lieberman's position on Iraq is nearly identical to Hillary Clinton's position on Iraq didn't seem to be an issue.  Lieberman was seen as someone they could beat; Hillary was obviously too tough for the wimp brigade to take on and she got a free pass.<br /><br />Now comes the topper.  <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/25/181546/729">The same site that absolutely roasted Lieberman</a> for not being enough of a Democrat to be returned to the United States Senate, has decided...get this...that now he's not a good Democrat because he won't support Democrat candidates in other Connecticut political races this November.<blockquote> Not only has Joe usurped all GOP support for the nominal Republican in the race, he's throwing over all other Democratic candidates in the state as well.<br /><br /> <span>   Declaring himself a "non-combatant," U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman, in remarks at a New Haven press event Friday, raised anew the question of whether his "independent" candidacy will help Republicans hold onto three Congressional seats in Connecticut -- and control of the U.S. House of Representatives. . . .<br /><br />    "I'm a non-combatant," Lieberman declared. "I am not going to be involved in other campaigns. I think it's better if I just focus on my own race."<br /></span><br /> (The bolded portion is a quote from a<a href="http://www.newhavenindependent.org/archives/2006/08/noncombatant_jo.php"> New Haven Independent article</a>.)<br /><br />That's a "devoted Democrat" for you.</blockquote>...<blockquote>And there is Joe's present to the GOP. They want to focus on the House and governor's race, and he's clearing the way for them. Not only is he paying GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, who's working two of those races, he's refusing to support any Democrats in their races.<br /><br />Psssst, Joe.... That makes you a Republican. I guess we know now how much stock to put in Joe's protestations of devotion to the Democratic party. Actually, when you think about it, Joe's always been a non-combatant when it comes to standing up to the GOP. But that's the Lieberman Principle for you. If it's good for Joe, it's good.</blockquote><br />Even with my extremely limited reading on the Daily Kos website, I already knew that its chief characteristic was <span>hypocrisy</span>, but this sets a new standard of hypocrisy even for this bunch.  First they claim that Lieberman is not a good Democrat and they demand his job.  Next they act surprised that Lieberman does not feel a lot of loyalty to the Connecticut Democrats who went along with his lynching rather than offering him support when he needed it most.<br /><br />Psssst, Kos & company...you guys are not just strange, you are stupid.
