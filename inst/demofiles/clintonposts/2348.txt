<span>Now that we are back I don't know what to <a href="http://politicalhumor.about.com/library/jokes/blbushjoke42.htm">write about</a>? Should I write about how the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/19/AR2006081900568_pf.html">right wing of the Republican Party is</a> hammering George W. Bush on <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/posts/2006/08/15/scarborough-is-bush-an-idiot/">being a lightweight intellectually</a>? Or should I write about Hillary Clinton being such a lighting rode? <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,1229053,00.html">Time has an interesting article about how sheâs viewed as â</a>

Some people feel this is a made to order set of elections <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_edwards">for John Edwards</a>. Edwards could be expected from the early polling to sweep all these states.<br />
<br />My sense is Al Gore still is the strongest candidate for the Democrats. <a href="http://www.localnewswatch.com/skyvalley/stories/index.php?action=fullnews&id=212334">It looks like Senator McCain will be the republicansâ nominee</a>. With George Allen making a fool of himself and probably setting himself up for a defeat in November, McCain looks like the strongest republican. The Democrats will need a strong candidate with experience to counter McCainâs hold on the military/national security issue.<br />
<br />A nice Presidential team would be Al Gore and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Sestak">Joe Sestak</a>.
