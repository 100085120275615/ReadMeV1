<p>I think people perceive Hillary as more of a centrist than they used to, and not without reason. </p>
<p>It is funny how the rights view of Hillary has changed. <strong>For years, Republicans have been convinced that Hillary was unelectable in a general election, but that Democrats were so in love with her that they couldn&#8217;t resist nominating her.</strong> (The truth: It isn&#8217;t so much that we love her, as you really, really hate her.) First it was going to happen in 2004, then it was supposed to happen in 2008. <strong>NOW, with the Lamont victory, the theory is that Hillary is in trouble.</strong> Following the Republican logic, then, Democrats are saved. Hooray! ;)</p>
