<p>The new war in Lebanon just fills me with the same sense of helplessness as most of what is going on in the Middle East. I&#8217;m no fan of Israel, and even less a fan of their neocon supporters in the U.S. who have pretty successfully demonized any criticism of Israel as &#8220;anti-Semitism.&#8221; (It&#8217;s not like they really love Jews that much &#8212; they just love anyone who blows the shit out of Arabs, and then there&#8217;s their <a href="http://www.raptureready.com/">batshit crazy rapture cultist fringe</a>  that thinks Israel needs to be around so all the Jews can die in a fiery apocalypse before the Second Coming of Jeebus.)</p>

<p>It does disgust me the way every New York politician from Hillary Clinton to Mike Bloomberg has to swear an oath of fealty to Israel in order to keep his or her job.</p>

<p>That said, I&#8217;m certainly no fan of Hamas or the Hezballah, nor, for that matter, most of the Arab world, where virulent batshit-crazy anti-semitism is still the norm. Arab diplomats may talk about wanting peace and a &#8220;balanced solution&#8221; regarding Israel when Western cameras are rolling, but the reality is, most Arabs would be quite happy to see Israelis slaughtered to the last man, woman, and child.</p>

<p>In other words, there are no &#8220;good guys&#8221; there, nor any innocents.</p>

<p>Except the children.</p>

<p>Right now, Israelis are bombing the shit out of Lebanon, and lots of civilians are dying. And in the U.S. news media, Israel gets a pass because basically, well, they&#8217;re not <em>trying</em> to kill noncombatants. This is topped with generous helpings of &#8220;Hey, it sucks, but bad things happen in wars!&#8221; and from the batshit crazy rapture cultist crowd: &#8220;Those people deserve it anyway for supporting Hezballah.&#8221;</p>

<p>What kind of drove me over the edge on this issue was a lead-in for the newcast on one of NYC&#8217;s evening news stations: a reporter in Israel standing next to a spot where a rocket blew a hole in the ground. In a horrified tone: &#8220;Tonight at 11, see where a Hezballah rocket <em>almost hit an Israeli daycare center</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Oh, the horror!</strong> The evil Hezballah <i><strong>almost</strong></i> <em>hit a daycare center</em>! Those <strong>fiends</strong>!! Those murderous evil terrorist monsters! Almost killing <em>children</em>!!! Those precious, precious children! Won&#8217;t someone <strong>please</strong> think of the children?!</p>

<p>(<strong>Warning</strong>: The above link is not worksafe and very graphic.)</p>

<p>(And yes, it&#8217;s also very, very slanted. No shit. Kind of my point&#8230; how do you cover the slaughter of children in a &#8220;balanced&#8221; fashion? Certainly not with histrionics about a near miss at an Israeli daycare center while remaining silent about the bloody toll wreaked in Lebanon.)</p>
