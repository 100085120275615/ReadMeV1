Eisenhower; plan devised during a Democratic administration)</p><br /><p>ITALIAN TERROR. As confirmed by a former Italian Prime Minister, an Italian judge, and the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,462976,00.html" target="_blank">former head of Italian counterintelligence</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_of_tension" target="_blank">NATO, with the help of the Pentagon and CIA, carried out terror bombings in Italy and blamed the communists, in order to rally peopleâs support for their governments in Europe in their fight against communism. </a>As one participant in this formerly-secret program stated: <a href="http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/synopsis.htm" target="_blank">"You had to attack civilians, people, women, children, innocent people, unknown people far removed from any political game. The reason was quite simple. They were supposed to force these people, the Italian public, to turn to the state to ask for greater security."</a> (commenced during Nixon administration, then continued under both Republican and Democratic administrations)</p><p><br /></p><p>GULF WAR. Two lies were used to justify the 1991 Gulf War: <a href="http://66.111.201.132/video/cte_11_lo.mov" target="_blank">the statement that Iraqis murdered Kuwaiti babies and the statement that Iraqi troops were massed on the border with Saudi Arabia</a> (second half of video)(technically, the statement about Kuwaiti babies did not come from the U.S. government).

The anthrax attacks -- which were sent along with notes purportedly written by Islamic terrorists -- used a weaponized anthrax strain <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&amp;contentId=A49502-2001Dec15" target="_blank">from the top U.S. bioweapons facility, the Fort Detrick military base?</a> Indeed, <a href="http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=288522002" target="_blank">top bioweapons experts have stated that the anthrax attack may have been a CIA test "gone wrong"</a>; and see <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/madsenanthrax.html" target="_blank">this article by a former NSA and naval intelligence officer</a>. <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/11/21/anthrax/index_np.html" target="_blank">It is also interesting that the only congress people mailed anthrax-containing letters were key democrats, and that the attacks occurred one week before passage of the freedom-curtailing Patriot Act,</a> which seems to have scared them and the rest of congress into passing that act without even reading it. And it might be coincidence, but <a href="http://www.judicialwatch.org/2953.shtml" target="_blank">White House staff began taking the anti-anthrax medicine before the Anthrax attacks occurred</a>.

As shown by <a href="http://sf.indymedia.org/uploads/sacrificeatpearlharbor.rm" target="_blank">this BBC special</a> (which contains interviews with some of the key players), it is possible that America knew of the Japanese plan to attack Pearl Harbor â down to the exact date of the attack â and allowed it to happen to justify America's entry into World War II. See also<a href="http://www.independent.org/newsroom/article.asp?ID=103" target="_blank"> this short essay </a>by a <a href="http://www.pearlharbor41.com/praise.htm" target="_blank">highly-praised historian</a> summarizing some of the key points (the historian, a World War II veteran, actually agreed with this strategy for getting America into the war, and so does not have any axe to grind). The Pearl Harbor "conspiracy" involved hundreds of military personnel, according to top historians. Moreover, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCollum_memo" target="_blank">the White House apparently had, a year earlier, launched an 8-point plan to provoke Japan into war against the U.S. </a>(including, for example, an oil embargo) And â most stunning â the  administration <a href="http://www.thenewamerican.com/tna/2001/06-04-2001/vo17no12_facts.htm" target="_blank">took numerous affirmative steps to ensure that the Japanese attack would be successful</a> (Franklin D. Roosevelt).</p><p><br /></p><p>OPERATION NORTHWOODS. Recently declassified documents show that in the 1960's, the American Joint Chiefs of Staff signed off on a plan to blow up AMERICAN airplanes (using an elaborate plan involving the switching of airplanes), and also committing terrorist murders against U.S. citizens on American soil, and then blaming it on the Cubans in order to justify an invasion of Cuba.

Local news reports after the blast indicated that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMXMo3Z0qms&eurl">there were numerous blasts</a>, contrary to the official story.   A Brigadier General wrote a report finding that <a href="http://www.whatreallyhappened.com/RANCHO/POLITICS/OK/PARTIN/okm.htm">there were multiple, high-tech bombs used to bring down the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City</a>.
