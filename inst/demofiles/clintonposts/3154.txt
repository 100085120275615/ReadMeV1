<div>I can't resist an entry.  My fingers are swollen and my arms are gross, but yet I am still dedicated to bringing you the news that counts.  A few weeks ago when the rumors of Jeb Bush running for VP were abound I thought to myself we are becoming a Monarchy.  I was trying to rack my brain for a way to avoid this sort of thing happening.  Just think of it:  If Jeb Bush runs or Hillary runs that means that since 1984 our presidents will have either a Bush or a Clinton.  for 20+ years 2 families will have run this country or had a hand in it.....doesn't that frighten you a little?<br />
<br />My thought was to not allow a sibling run for public office or something like that.  It is a joke and it is happening all over the country. <br />
<br />Well read this lovely article and tell me there isn't something wrong with the current state of affairs.  We need to get back to talking about term limits people and fast!<br />

<em>
<strong>In 1986, at least 24 U.S. senators and representatives were closely related to governors or other members of Congress, USA TODAY research shows.<br />
<br />Twenty years later, there are more than 50 â among them four sets of siblings, four widows, dozens of offspring, the wife of a former Senate majority leader and Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, wife of a former president and governor.</strong>
