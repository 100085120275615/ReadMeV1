<div>I'm not sold on John McCain as a republican presidential candidate yet.<br />
<br />But I like the idea.<br />
<br />But, when he claims he's a conservative republican, "not a liberal republican, not a moderate republican":<br />
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201482.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201482.html</a>
<br />That's just too much bullshit to swallow.<br />
<br />There's also, by the way, nothing wrong with being a moderate republican on certain issues -the environment for example, or CAFE standards, poverty, healthcare, etc (of course market-oriented solutions tends to help).<br />
<br />In fact, I have a hard time believing that a conservative republican, like a Gingrich or Santorum, could possibly win the next election if the Democrats find an moderate with a flare for oratory or even if the dread Hillary cometh.<br />
<br />But a moderate, market-oriented, foreign policy hawk Republican runs against either, he can win. I'll qualify that with the Iraq situation as a wildcard which, depending on how it turns out, could help or hurt any kind of republican. But if a stable government forms, we pull Zarqawi out of a hole, and troops drawdown over the next three years, I doubt that it will hurt. Some big ifs in there, unfortunately.<br />
<br />Of course, if the mid-terms bring a hostile congress with a wild hair up their ass to impeach Bush ( Bill, I guess revenge is bitch), then we can expect a distracted president and executive will have (more) trouble with Iraq. Bonus to regional instability if the Dems pull the troops out before they should.<br />
<br />I hope somebody out there has one hell of a midterm strategy.</div>
