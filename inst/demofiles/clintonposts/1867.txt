<blockquote>
<span>Political reporter Dan Balz, no babe in the woods, just embarrasses himself by declaring that Hillaryâs inner circle has discovered she has âa curious intellect, the absence of rigid ideology, an instinct for problem solving and a willingness to seek consensus even across party lines.â In a telephone interview, Hillary told Balz she is in no way a rigid thinker, that she approaches each problem and tries âcombining my beliefs and ideals with a search for practical solutions.â</span>
<p class="MsoNormal">    Balz is not so much reporting a news story as reproducing a sales pitch. It really ought to have the word âadvertisementâ above it in capital letters. Itâs a misleading commercial. If you bought President Hillary, you would not be getting the âabsence of rigid ideology.â You would get rigid liberal ideology, softened only by Slick Willie political posturing, with gullible journalists gleefully hooking on their bait.</p>

<span>You know, the old adages are often right. My mother has noticed recently that when she has an apple a day, she really </span>
<span>does </span>
<span>feel better. And actions </span>
<span>do </span>
<span>speak louder than words. In democratic politics, candidates get really good at lying to us. But their voting records speak volumns, if only they were looked at. Hillary's voting record and her rhetoric have rarely matched up.</span>
