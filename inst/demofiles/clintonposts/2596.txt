I've been thinking of her as Tamago-chan. (The first sushi I ever tried--in the airplane as I was moving to Japan--was a piece of tamago. I was truly frightened by everything on the plate, but I figured 'How bad can this little omelet be?') I, um, realize that she's a little plain at this point, but really, I'm getting there. These things take time. </p>

<p>I love her. <a href="http://www.weewonderfuls.com/">Hillary</a>'s a genius, of course, and writes amazingly easy-and-fun-to-follow patterns, but still I almost accidentally killed her twice--the kitty, not Hillary! Once when I clipped a seam (between her legs, poor dear) a little too enthusiastically. She ended up with a slightly higher rise than she was supposed to have, but I don't think it's too noticeable. And then I ripped the seam a bit below her arm as I was stuffing her. I always have trouble stuffing softies. The stuffing gets so matted and lumpy and strange inside. I try to stuff extra firmly, and somehow I end up stressing--or ripping--the seams. Does this happen to other people too? Am I doing it wrong? Does wool stuffing get less matted and yucky than the poly stuff? Anyway, she's holding together OK post-fixes, and I'm not anticipating a very action-filled life for her, so I think she'll be fine. </p>

<p>Ben is crazy about her. When he first saw the sushi fabric, he practically shrieked with joy. 'I LOVE this! Where did you get this? Is there any left? Can I have some? Can I have this piece?' He was holding a tiny triangular scrap about two inches long, but so reverently, you would have thought it was the Holy Grail or something. The kid loves sushi. He's scared to death to try a turkey sandwich in his lunchbox, but he loves sushi. </p>

<p>I'm heading off to the craft room (I really don't think I'm going to be calling it a studio anytime soon--in fact, I'm thinking of getting a big box of wagon wheel macaroni and some Elmer's) to cut out the details of her dress and shoes. I think I'll take them with me to knitting tomorrow night. The Afghan Jaywalkers and I are sort of on a break.<br /></p></div>
