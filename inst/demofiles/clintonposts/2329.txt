<strong>I've often wondered what the draw was to Lindsay Lohan.</strong> So when there was a set of photos of her in various bathing suits I decided to see for myself.<br />
<br />The girl has no hips. No shape. No figure real figure of any kind. Her legs are skinny and scrawny. She looks like a boy with boobs. Seriously, I don't get it. She looks undernourished.<br />
<br />And she's an airhead.<br />
<br />Every quote I've read of hers makes her sounds stupid. STUPID.<br />
<br />
<strong>And Hillary Duff?</strong> Eat a damn Big Mac or three. Your head is way too big for your body. That goes for <strong>Nicole Ritchie</strong> as well.<br />
<br />
<strong>Ritchie</strong> use to have this cute little figure until she went on a hunger strike.<br />
<br />Now she's a walking stick (that's an insect that looks like a stick...saw one the other day...the country is cool like that).<br />
<br />The only thing I can conclude is that these girls aren't as well off as we all think. They must not be able to afford food. I'm thinking about starting a fund to feed undernourished starlets...because DAMN! they look like they could pose as starving children for one of those feed the world organizations.<br />
<br />Seriously.</span>
