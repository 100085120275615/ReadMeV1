<div>Mrs. Values Voter has mentioned that <a href="http://valuesvoter.blogspot.com/2005/02/i-agree-with-howard-dean.html">my reference to the Hayes v. Taylor race in 1998</a> was a little obscure (OK - she said nobody would understand what I was talking about). On reflection, she was right.<br />
<br />So hereâs the background. In 1996, the 8th district in North Carolina narrowly voted for Dole over Clinton, 46.2% to 46%. The people of the district are, by and large, very religious, and, while the district was politically pretty evenly split in 1998, the influence of the eastern part of the district provided a solid Democratic base.<br />
<br />Mike Taylor was the Democratic candidate who was pro-life. Robin Hayes was the Republican candidate, who was also pro-life. While it was an open seat vacated by a Democrat, Hayes had the advantage in name recognition and money. The national party did not provide fiscal support to Taylor until the final weeks of the race. Early on in the race, the reason given for this was that the money wasnât there for a long-shot candidacy. Only as it became clear that the race would hinge on a few votes did the national money appear for Taylor. The final result: Hayes - 50.7%, Taylor - 48.2%, a difference of just over 3,000 votes. Had the national party supported this pro-life candidate earlier, he would likely have won. Instead, the money flowed to several candidates with less of a chance, with wider margins in their polling.<br />
<br />Thereâs a chance of a similarly tight race in Pennsylvania in 2006. Senator Rick Santorum is up for re-election, and <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/10791709.htm?1c">there have been suggestions that Democrat Bob Casey, Jr. is interested in running against him</a>.<br />
<br />Voters interested in social issues have had a bone to pick with Santorum despite his solid voting record because he backed Senator Arlen Specter in the primary last year against Pat Twomey. A pro-lifer like Casey, with his principled stands and name recognition as the son of a very popular former Pennsylvania governor, would, to my mind, be able to unseat Santorum. If the Democrats are interested in picking up that seat, they should offer early money to Casey to run, and throw every ounce of energy into getting him elected.<br />
<br />So far they seem to be making an effort. <a href="http://politicspa.com/FEATURES/05What%20would%20a%20Santorum-%20Casey%20Senate%20race%20look%20like.htm">It will be interesting to see how it plays out</a>. This would be a race with national implications, not just for the party balance of power in the Senate, but to see how open the party can be to pro-lifers.</div>
