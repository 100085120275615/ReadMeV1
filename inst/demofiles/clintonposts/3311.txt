<div>It is very tough to be a Republican in 2006, because somehow, you have to believe concurrently that:<br />1. Jesus loves you, but shares your deep hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.<br />
<br />2. The United States should get out of the United Nations, but our highest national priority is enforcing UN resolutions against Iraq.<br />
<br />3. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.<br />
<br />4.The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches, while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay<br />
<br />5. Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins, unless you someday run for governor of California as a Republican.<br />
<br />6. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.<br />
<br />7. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, but then demand their cooperation and money.8. HMOs and insurance companies have the interests of the public at heart.<br />
<br />8. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy - - Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.<br />
<br />9. Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.<br />
<br />10. It is OK that the Bush family's Carlisle Group has done millions of business with the Bin Laden family.<br />
<br />11. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him and Rumsfeld reassured him he was our buddy, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, but then a bad guy again when Bush junior needed a prop for his re-election campaign as the war President.<br />
<br />12. A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying about WMD existence to enlist support for an unprovoked, undeclared war and occupation, in which thousands of soldiers and civilians die, is, somehow, solid defense policy in a War against Terrorism.<br />
<br />13. Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which should include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.<br />
<br />14. The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades but George Bush's Harken Oil stock trade should be sealed in his Daddy's library, and is none of our business.<br />
<br />15. What Bill Clinton or John Kerry did in the 1960âs is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the 80's is irrelevant.17. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.<br />
<br />16. You are a conservative, but it is OK to spend like there is no tomorrow and run up deficits that your grandchildren will have to pay, while at the same time refunding as much tax money as possible to rich people who do not need it.<br />

<em>Contemplating these illogical paradoxes can take a toll on a healthy mind. So if a friend of yours has been acting a bit dazed and confused lately, be nice: he or she may be a Republican.</em>
