<span>"No one on the current political scene better embodies this Republican advantage than the current secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice. The archetype that Ms. Rice represents is "overcoming" rather than grievance."  </span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>"...because Ms. Rice is grounded in this tradition, she is of absolutely no value to modern liberalism or the Democratic Party despite her many talents and achievements. Quite the reverse, she is their worst nightmare. If blacks were to take her example and embrace overcoming rather than grievance, the wound to liberalism would be mortal. <strong>It is impossible to imagine Hillary Clinton's "plantation" pandering in a room full of Condi Rices.</strong> "</span>

<strong>"Idealisms quickly descend into evil because they are so easily seized as a means to ordinary power.</strong> The politics of black uplift was once an idealism, but today it has become the work of hacks, tired apparatchiks and <strong>petty demagogues</strong> <strong>looking for power</strong>. And there, on TV last week, as if to illustrate this truth, was the specter of Mrs. Clinton and Al Sharpton embracing at the podium, mere captives of power making the tired charge--via an encrusted plantation metaphor--that Republicans are racists. What exhaustion! <strong>And what evil, to labor so hard at keeping blacks mired in grievance."</strong> (emphasis mine)</span>
