<br />
<br />
<span>Dear friends...
<br />We sit here now with one weekend to go until Election Day.
<br />Possibly the most important election of our lifetimes.
<br />Now, more than ever it is necessary that each and every one of us do like our Founding Fathers and put patriotism above partisanship.
<br />We've been hearing about this election for over a year. The discussions have gotten louder and have increased in intensity as Election Day draws near. Sadly, they have also become more dishonest. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Viscious lies have been told about one candidate while truths about the other have been decried as "negative" campaigning.
<br />Even if you think you've made up your mind, I implore you to consider these facts and questions before casting your ballot on November 2, 2004. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>JOHN KERRY==============
<br />Why won't John Kerry release ALL his service records as Bush has? Since he is running on his four-months of in-country service in Vietnam, this is a valid concern. What is he hiding?
<br />After 20 years in the U.S. Senate, what bills has Kerry written that improved this country? He keeps talking about "he has a plan", but his track record in the Senate shows none.
<br />Why did Kerry oppose the 1991 Gulf War? He has said he would want US Policy to pass a global test of our allies. Yet in 1991 we had a coalition which included France and Germany and had full UN Approval: Kerry STILL voted against it. How big a test does he need? </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Kerry claims that he will bring France and Germany on board in Iraq. Those countries have already indicated they would still not take part in Iraq even if Kerry was elected. So the only way to bring them on will be to compromise the US Position and Strategy to something they could agree to. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Kerry also insults our strongest allies by claiming America has "gone at it alone" in Iraq. He has insulted even the new Iraqi Prime Minister (who is also an ally). What coalition is strengthened by alienating Britain, Poland, Australia and the other 30+ countries working with us in Iraq?
<br />You may have heard "Bush Lied" -- but no one ever has demonstrated where Bush lied. There was faulty WMD intelligence that didn't come from Bush, but Britain and everyone including Kerry believed it. However, Kerry has been caught in many, many lies and distortions. Do we need a president who is truth-impaired? </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>GEORGE W. BUSH==============
<br />Bush lowered taxes for all taxpayers, not just the wealthy as Kerry claims. Several million lower income Americans who previously paid taxes had them lowered so much that they no longer pay them. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Yes, the wealthy got a tax break too, but they still pay the lion's share of taxes. The "wealthy" aren't all people like the Kerrys who have hoards of accumulated wealth. Most own businesses or run companies and create jobs for millions of Americans.
<br />Remember 9/11? Of course you do. George W. Bush led us through this attack and the recovery masterfully. Even democrats could find no fault with his handling of this crisis. Who do you want in charge if something were to happen again? </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Speaking of it happening again... it hasn't. Is that for lack of Al Qaeda interest? Or have the homeland security measures Bush implemented actually worked?
<br />We, thanks to Bush's leadership, defeated the Taliban in short order and Afghanistan just had their first democratic election in years with millions voting including about 45% women. Women! In a Muslim country. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>We, thanks to Bush's leadership, liberated Iraq from a tyrant who enslaved that nation for over 30 years. Saddam is in jail awaiting trial. His evil sons are dead. Iraq is free and the people there are grateful. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Terrorists have joined the remants of Saddam loyalists and attack us sporadically. One of the rules of war is to control the battlefield. We are doing that in Iraq. Soldiers have died (it is war), but they are fighting us in Iraq and not here... Where would you rather them fight?
<br />Even with the risks and dangers, the majority of our soldiers support the president. Compare that to what mainstream media are telling you. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>You may hear that Bush "lost more jobs since Hoover". True and false. If you go by the percentages, Hoover has everyone beat. Under Bush, unemployment is as low or lower than during all of Clinton's term. And more people total are working than ever before. So you're only getting a half-truth when you hear this job-loss quote. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Bush's programs began to turn around the Clinton recession (that started when the Dot-Coms started failing in March 2000). Then 9/11 occurred and as the airlines started losing money, it trickled to other industries. Jobs were lost. However, we have recovered greatly since then and the economy is stronger than ever -- and without the false stock market bubble from internet-mania. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>CONCLUSION==============
<br />Are you voting for Kerry solely because he's the Democratic candidate? To quote Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness in "The Untouchables" -- "Is this some kind of game?" Just because you've been a lifelong Democrat (and I thought I was too until 1989), doesn't mean you have to vote against the Republican. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>America's safety and security is not a game. If you (like the majority of Americans according to polls) think George W. Bush is stronger on keeping American safe -- then you must be like Senator Zell Miller (D-GA) and former NYC Mayor Ed Koch (D) and set aside your party and vote for George W. Bush for President.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>"Ask not what your country can do for you (partisanship). Ask what you can do for your country (patriotism)." What you can best do for your country is RE-ELECT GEORGE W. BUSH!</span>
