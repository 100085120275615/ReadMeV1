<div>To hell with the Abramof scandal. Here's one that is far worse than. Illinois congressman Danny Davis and an aide took a trip to Sri Lanka last year that was paid for by the Tamil Tigers. The Tamil Tigers are a group officially classified by the US Government as a terrorist organization.<br />
<br />The Tamil Tigers use suicide bombers and child soldiers. Talk about your culture of corruption! Abramof was lobbying on behalf of Native American groups, these guys are lobbying so they can continue killing innocent civilians!<br />
<br />So what of it Palosi? Still think it's the Republican party that's corrupt? Word of advice, check your own house first. You might find worse problems there.<br />
