<div>The $6 billion UAE port deal (which, I will remind you, has as much chance of occurring as threading a needle with a camel) is revealing how money sometimes creates strange bedfellows.<br />
<br />Seems Hillary doesn't know who Bill is sleeping with again.<br />
<br />You see, Bill has been paid coughbribedcough $600,000 to give speeches to in the UAE in the past several years. Having paid the entry fee, the Emirates get Bill's cell phone number in return, and no sooner than the port deal became public did the shieks cash in their chit, phoneing Bill to get advice on how to shove the deal down the throats of Americans opposed to it.<br />
<br />While Bill is in one bedroom quietly chatting with his desert paramours, Hill is in the next room, plotting with Pelosi to sink the deal. <a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/60489.htm">Asked about it</a>, she had this to say: "That's . . . I mean, as far as I know, (Bill) supports my position and has said so publicly."<br />
<br />Other strangeness: Check out the last paragraph in this story. Seems the Israeli's are in bed with the Arabs on this deal too. What with $6 billion on the line, seems like the blood fued can be placed on hold for ... well, at least 45 days.</div>
