<span>Ah, Yes. The incompetence of our government, never ceases to amaze me.</span>

<a href="http://cbs2.com/topstories/topstories_story_083135520.html">(CBS) PHOENIX Thousands of immigrant rights supporters filled a major Phoenix thoroughfare Friday morning as they marched toward the office of U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl in a rally call for a more humane reform of immigration laws.</a>
</blockquote>
<span>Humane of course means free, unobstructed invasion of our soil, without any documented accountability for anything. How many of these punks, who are not here illegally, have visited an emergency room lately? Oh. I forgot. They are all ideological liberal yoots, who want everyone with a real job, to pay both their health insurance and free state sponsored medial care for criminal alien invaders.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Many of the protesters said they were most incensed by one immigration reform proposal approved by the U.S. House of Representatives in December that would make it make it a felony to be in the country illegally.</blockquote>
<br />
<span>It is much better to wait for that felonious rape, murder and theft by the criminal invader. Then we have a genuine citizen victim to support AND a wetback criminal to feed in jail. At least we can claim a felony was committed on moral principles, other than criminal invasion.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Kyl, a Republican, is sponsoring a bill along with Republican Sen. John Cornyn of Texas that would give illegal immigrants up to five years to leave the country. They would then be able to apply from their home country to return, either as temporary workers or for permanent residency.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<span>Wow. How terribly inhumane of Sen. Cornyn. He wants to tell everyone that pushes their way in front of the line, to see the popular movie 'The American Dream', sponsored by that famous producer John Q. Taxpayer, to go back to the end of the line and wait like everyone else. Take his popcorn and soda away folks.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The protests come as President Bush has urged lawmakers to approach the contentious immigration issue in a way that avoids pitting groups against each other.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<span>Err... you mean like pitting that group of law-abiding citizens and taxpayers against that group of entitlement-sucking criminal alien invaders?</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The Senate is scheduled to take up the immigration issue next week. State and federal lawmakers have come under pressure by voters to find a way to deal with an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants already in the country.</blockquote>
<br />
<span>Insolutip:<br />
<br />Here is how to deal with them.<br />
<br />
</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Put them to work building a 30 foot above ground concrete wall, running 20 feet deep into the sand of the U.S./Mexican border.  </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Provide free delicious, iced GOP cool aide and bologna sandwiches for that hot work, under the Mexican sun.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Next, push them over the top of the wall. </span>
</li>
<li>
<span>Finally, tell them the check is in the mail.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<br />
<blockquote>Some states have taken steps to try to limit or cut state services to such immigrants.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<span>Try to limit? As Yoda says, "There is no try. There is only Do!"</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Lawmakers have also been considering bills that would impose new penalties on employers who hire illegal immigrants. Another proposal is to erect fences along one-third of the U.S.-Mexican border.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<a href="http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pagename=iic_immigrationissuecentersbcdd">How about enforcing the penalties that already exist on the books?</a>
<span> It is a felony, by the way.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The proposals have angered many in the Hispanic community.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
<span>Looks like we should commission a Berkeley study about whiny, foreign ingrates who grow up to be illegal, entitlement demanding parasites.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>On Thursday, more than 10,000 people filled the streets of Milwaukee in what was billed as "A Day Without Latinos" to protest efforts in Congress to target undocumented workers.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<span>Beautiful. We just identified 8,800 criminal invaders, who can be rounded-up right away, and 1,200 criminals who can be busted for drug possession.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Hundreds of Los Angeles students walked out Friday morning to call attention to immigration issues.</blockquote>
<br />
<span>They have my attention. This is a good thing. It is one less school day full of the liberal brain blender, set to puree, courtesy of the LA public school system.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>In Georgia, activists said tens of thousands of workers did not show up at their jobs on Friday after calls for a work stoppage to protest a bill passed by the Georgia House on Thursday. That bill, which has yet to gain Senate approval, would deny state services to adults living in the U.S. illegally and impose a 5 percent surcharge on wire transfers from illegals.<br />Teodoro Maus, one of the organizers of the Georgia protest, estimated as many as 80,000 Hispanics did not show up for work Friday.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<span>This reminds me of the anarchist youths burning France right now, committing national security suicide, in the name of job security. It is just drawing the attention of the American citizen to the real scope of the disaster, promulgated by both the President and the liberal Democrats, every time they openly fail their Constitutional sworn duty, to enforce the law.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>About 200 people converged on the steps of the Georgia Capitol, some wrapped in Mexican flags and holding signs reading: "Don't panic, we're Hispanic" and "We have a dream, too."</blockquote>
<span>Note the choice of flag those people are draped in. It is a Mexican dream; not the American dream. We should panic.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Bush said Thursday that his message is: "If you are doing a job that Americans won't do, you're welcome here for a period of time to do that job."</blockquote>
<span> Wrong, wrong, forever in error. Drive over to Houston, and give those Katrina evacuees, who seem to have all the free time in the world, a Ray Nagin bus ride to the job site. They can pull up their welfare entitlements, and earn their keep.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The president is working hand-in-hand with employers who want cheap labor to clean hotel rooms, pick crops and do other tasks that they say keep their businesses competitive. Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., says he understands those economic issues, but his focus is on the main concern voiced by the social conservatives national security.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<span>This is more economic gobbledygook bull shite. Frist should not even bow to deference on this ridiculous score. This does not keep employers competitive. It puts the few employers, who legally employ American citizens and legal aliens, out of business. If you want to eliminate the need for a minimum wage, you can use the same feedback mechanism used to eliminate inflation. They control inflation by regulating the money supply. You can regulate wages by controlling the labor supply. Build that wall. Control the rate of immigration. The wages will follow.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The public appears to be more on the side of tougher border control. Three-quarters of respondents to a Time magazine poll in January said the United States is not doing enough to keep illegal immigrants from entering the country. Roughly the same amount said they favor a guest worker program for illegal immigrants, but 46 percent said those workers should have to return first to their native countries and apply. About 50 percent favored deporting all illegal immigrants.<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
<span>And you can be sure, if those are the numbers came from a Time magazine poll, the real figure is more like 70-30 for deportation.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>"We've scheduled two weeks of debate," his spokeswoman said, underscoring the divisiveness of the issue. "We need all two weeks."</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
<span>Insolu-translation: We have scheduled two more weeks of nascent, Dr. Feel Good, unproductive D.C. gum flapping and butt slapping. This will spray a little sweet lilac water on this festering public abscess. We dearly hope that this, combined with some well placed tranquilizing, mind-numbing MSM sponsored committee Valium, will squeeze us by another election. Then someone else can saw off the putrefied, gangrenous limb. Meanwhile, we can all gather in the sauna, trade some earmarks, some lobby swag and some laughs at the expense of those poor suckers, paying the freight.</span>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., backed by labor unions, has said he will do all he can, including filibuster, to thwart Frist's legislation. So has Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y., who said legislation seeking to criminalize undocumented immigrants is not in line with Republicans' stated support for faith and values and "would literally criminalize the Good Samaritan and probably even Jesus himself."</blockquote>
<br />
<span>Now this is Hillary-ous. Vincente Fox's bogus, corrupt Mexican cartel, swimming in oil revenues, is shipping their problem over here, demanding services, demanding political power, declaring war on our nation, by virtue of a criminal alien invasion. These two dancing clown DNC marionettes tell us the Republicans are to blame, for not being compassionate Samaritans. What about the 'teach a man to fish' story, you inflated, varicose, pathetic media whores.</span>
