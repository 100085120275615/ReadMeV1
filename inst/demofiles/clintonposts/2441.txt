<span>I received this MEME from Gabriel over at <a href="http://modernfabulousity.blogspot.com/2006/08/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about.html">Modern Fabulousity</a>.  And since he tagged me.  I have no choice but to answer the following tough questions.  </span>
<br />
<br />DISCLAIMER.....  (Redux):  If you were here earlier in the day, you discoved many things about your dear QTA host of a very personal nature.  What can I say, I feel compelled to speak the truth with as much honesty as I can muster, and I have always felt bound to honor the tag of the meme.<br />
<br />With that said... I also feel compelled to censor some of these questions and answers due to the very public nature of this blog.  I am a burgeoning academic after all, and not everyone needs to know the intimate details of every part of my life.  So if you read this earlier... you got a special treat... a unique insight into my life... if not, too bad... you missed out on some racy stuff!<br />
<br />1. How old were you when you knew you were gay?</strong> I was 8 when I first discovered that I liked boys... really liked boys.  A group of us were playing one of those games boys play in the woods, and I was being held prisoner.  When the boy who was the hero of our little story triumphantly came around the corner to save me... I swooned... literally.  But even though I was madly in love at that moment, I had no idea what "gay" was.  I didn't know I was GAY until I was 12.  By then I had heard the word used to label me since I was about 8, but it wasn't until I saw the video for Bronski Beat's "Smalltown Boy" that I was able to put 2 and 2 together and get gay.<br />

<strong>3. Who was the first person you came out to?</strong> I came out to my cousin Michelle first, then my entire high school the next day, then my parents... all very one, two, three... but, in fairness, as one of those sissy boys who were labeled queer and given a whole lot of shit about it... everyday... Coming out at school was really easy.  And this was when I was 15... in 1987.  All that said, I really shouldn't have had to come out at all... I mean, how many other eight year old boys watch <span>Mommie Dearest </span>and think it is delicious, listen to Charlene's "I've never been to me" and cry because he really feels the lyrics, and has been "putting on shows" for his family since he was 3?  I mean really people... the signs were all there.<br />
<strong>4. Are you out to your family?</strong> Yes.  All of them.  Even the extended members.<br />
<strong>5. Do you want children?</strong> Yes, one day... maybe in another 5-10 years.<br />
<strong>6. Do you have more gay friends or straight friends?</strong> Right now, the answer is Gay.  But that has never been a constant.  Sometimes I have more straight friends than gay ones, but I don't really care about the sexuality of my friends.  It has never been the determining factor.<br />
<strong>7. Were you out in school?</strong> Yes.<br />
<strong>8. Is your best friend the same sex as you?</strong> Yes.<br />

<strong>10. Would you prefer to date a guy taller than you or shorter than you?</strong> I have never really had a big preference for height.<br />

<strong>13. Have you ever dressed in drag? </strong>Yes.  I first did drag at age 3, wearing my grandmothers wigs and makeup and clothes, hiding behind a curtain while my family sat opposite the curtain waiting for my "show."  When I came out, they shined a flashlight on me and applauded.  I told you the signs were all there.  I have also performed in 3 plays where I played a woman (<span>SAGA! The Whitney Bonneville Story</span> - Alexa Montenegro, <span>Vampire Lesbians of Sodom</span> - Virgin Sacrifice/ Madeline Astarte, and <span>Poor Superman </span>- Shannon Dockery), plus I played Frank-N-Furter in a live cast of the <span>Rocky Horror Picture Show</span> from age 15 to 19.   And I dressed up in drag for Halloween on more than one occasion.  That said, I haven't done drag in about 9 years.  And I am really ok with that.<br />
<strong>14. Would you date a drag queen?</strong> Yes.<br />

<strong>17. How many Cher CDs do you own?</strong> None!  That said, my man owns several, and our collections share the same shelves.<br />
<strong>18. Name of your first love?</strong> Chris.  He was my high school boyfriend.  But I never knew what true love was until I met Perry.  Meeting him made me question every other time I thought I had been in love.<br />
<strong>19. Do you still talk to him?</strong> No.  Sometimes I wonder where he is, and if he's happy.  I hope so.<br />

<strong>21. Biggest turn on?</strong> Intelligence.<br />
<strong>22. Biggest turn off?</strong> Cruelty.<br />
<strong>23. Ever been harassed due to your orientation? </strong>Yes.  Many, many, many times.  Everyday from (roughly) ages 13-18.<br />
<strong>24. Worst gay stereotype that applies to you? </strong>I love show tunes! and I live for <span>America's Next Top Model</span>!<br />
<strong>25. Ever been to a pride rally?</strong> I believe I have been every year since 1990.<br />
<strong>26. Would you marry if you could?</strong> Yes.  But I am already married in the eyes of those who matter.<br />
<strong>27. Would you rather be rich and smart or young and beautiful? </strong>Rich and smart...Lasts a lot longer than either young or beautiful.<br />
<strong>28. Do you sculpt your eyebrows?</strong> Yes. But no so much that I look like Joan Crawford on a bender.<br />

<strong>32. Have you dated your best friend's ex?</strong> No!<br />
<strong>33. Would you vote for Hillary Clinton if she ran for president?</strong> I honestly don't know.  I am sooooooo ready for a woman to be President.  And while I think Hillary could do the job... she certainly has the skills for the position, I always hate it when I can see though the persona of a politician.  I find it so disillusioning.  And I always seem to see her political wheels turning... that kind of turns me off.  I would have to see how she runs her race.  I really just don't know.  I'd vote for Madeline Albright, but she can't run.  I'd vote for the fictional Mackinzie Allen.<br />
<strong>34. Do you want monogamy in your relationships? </strong>I think that monogamy in a relationship can be full of rewards, and it is certainly worth it.  That said, I think monogamy is a heterosexual/ patriarchal social construction that doesn't work for everyone.  I have seen relationships that were monogamous, but emotionally dead, and I have seen relationships that were not monogamous, but emotionally thriving and committed.  There is not an easy answer to this question.  It all depends on the people involved, and the emotional health and commitment of the relationship... each relationship is different.  I do think that it is a mistake to blindly accept any patriarchal construction without actively questioning it.  Monogamy can be great.  But monogamy for monogamy's sake (just because society says it is the way it must be) is hollow and meaningless.<br />
<strong>35. Do you believe in true love?</strong> Absolutely!  I have experienced it.<br />
<strong>36. Do you have any tattoos?</strong> I have 9 of them.<br />
<strong>37. Do you have any piercings?</strong> Yes... 5 of them.  But I no longer wear jewelry in any of the piercings.<br />
<strong>38. Would you date a smoker?</strong> Yes.<br />

<strong>40. Do you know anyone who has died from H.I.V.?</strong> Yes.  I miss them all very much.<br />
<strong>41. Do you know what Stonewall was?</strong>  Yes!  And I will repeat Gabriel's answer:  "Shameful that this question has to be asked. It should be taught in history classes, along with Nat Turner and other socially conscious uprisings."<br />
