<div>The "Joes" in Iraq have something to look forward to: <a href="http://woodshavingsdaily.blogspot.com">Lindsay Lohan</a>. <blockquote>''I've been trying to go to Iraq with Hillary Clinton for so long. Hillary was trying to work it out, but it seemed too dangerous,'' the 20-year-old actress says in an interview in the September issue of Elle magazine, on newsstands Wednesday.<br />
<br />Lohan, whose screen credits include ''Freaky Friday,'' ''Mean Girls'' and the upcoming ''Georgia Rule,'' says she hoped to emulate Marilyn Monroe, who performed shows for about 100,000 troops stationed in Korea in 1954.<br />
<br />''It's so amazing seeing that one woman just going somewhere, this beautiful sex kitten, who's basically a pinup, which is what I've always aspired to be,'' Lohan tells the magazine, adding that she would prepare for her trip to Iraq by taking shooting lessons with her security guard.</blockquote> Just what our troops need, a hung-over "sex-kitten" that wants to shoot her gun off.</div>
