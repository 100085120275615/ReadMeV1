That was too bad, considering they replaced <i>The Abrams Report</i> with <i>Tucker</i>, an hour of Tucker Carlson, one of the few conservative pundits who at least tries to be fair and balanced. And yet <i>still</i> Carlson is quite annoying at times. Bring back the <i>Abrams Report</i> in some fashion with Susan Filan as the host.<br />
<br />
Small potatoes though, having Dan Abrams chosen as General Manager of the all news network. Nothing is changed there. Chris Matthews is still the top cheerleader for his Republican friend George Allen, who Matthews believes will get the Republican nomination for president in 2008. Could Matthews have chosen anyone more loathsome than the senator from Virginia?<br />
<br />
Well, okay, Newt Gingrich will undoubtedly make a run as will Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, but George Allen is truly the âcreamâ of that brew of sewage. Whatâs his claim to fame? His daddy was a revered coach in the National Football League.<br />
<br />
Allen calls himself a âJeffersonian Conservative,â claiming to âtrust free people and free enterprise,â yet he supports the amendment to criminalize flag burning â desecration of the flag to be specific â which then intrudes on my first amendment rights.<br />
<br />
Hereâs whatâs âfunnyâ about that term, âJeffersonian Conservative,â which no one in the news media challenges. Jefferson, above all, was a libertarian, neither more conservative nor more liberal. He, Jefferson, was the strongest advocate of limited government and was also the strongest advocate of religious pluralism. It was Jefferson who defined âthe wall of separationâ between church and state, in regards to the First Amendment.<br />
<br />
But, it was also President Jefferson who took the presidency <i>outside</i> the bounds of the constitution when he bought the Louisiana Territory from the French in 1804 (The âLouisiana Purchaseâ). The Constitution didnât address the question of acquiring new land so Jefferson was indeed charting uncharted domain.<br />
<br />
Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence, the document that sets forth our âinaliable rights,â the central philosophy of our government, which more and more appears to be under siege from within. Jefferson, a strong advocate of âstates rights,â endorsed the Constitution, but only if it contained a âBill of Rights,â the first ten amendments to the constitution, which defines those âinaliable rights.â <br />
<br />
Allen, on the other hand, wants government in our pockets, in our bedrooms in our doctorsâ offices and now listening in on our phone calls and reading our e-mails. Hardly Jeffersonian.<br />
<br />
Besides supporting the anti-freedom flag burning amendment, Allen supports the presidentâs âanti-terrorismâ policies of cataloging and listening in on our phone calls, reading our e-mails and making criminals out of the millions of immigrants who stream North from Mexico to take jobs here in the United States. Not very Jeffersonian in philosophy there.<br />
<br />
If you read the senatorâs web site, you also see heâs against the judiciary being a âcheck and balanceâ against the other two branches of government, the legislature and the executive branches:<br />
<br />
â	âJudges should be committed to the rule of law and understand the proper, restrained role of a judge in our representative democracy.  Judges ought to apply the law and the Constitution, not invent the law or amend the Bill of Rights by judicial decree.  In our Republic, it is the right of the people and their elected representatives to make laws as they deem appropriate and that this right cannot be usurped by unelected federal judges who would inject their personal views in activist rulings.â<br />
<br />
In other words, the judiciary should rubber stamp whatever laws the president and congress think to pass, without regard to their affects <i>on</i> that Bill of Rights. Remember, it was the courts that struck down the âJim Crow Lawsâ that effectively made African-Americans second-class citizens.<br />
<br />
But hereâs whatâs <i>really</i> behind Allenâs âjudicial philosophy:â to maintain his support from the fanatics on the religious right, Allen supports overturning Roe v Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in America; specifically indicating that what goes on between a woman and her doctor is justifiably a private matter, out of bounds of the governmentâs scope of authority.<br />
<br />
What Allen hopes to do is pack the court with judges who are most likely to overturn that landmark decision. Okay, that describes about 300 other Republicans serving in the administration and congress today.<br />
<br />
The <i>most</i> troubling aspect of George Allen is his belief that we shouldnât engage in debate while at war, that we should just say âyes sirâ to the presidentâs policies, even if we think â and time proves â those policies are wrong.<br />
<br />
In a speech to the American Legionâs Virginia State Convention, Allen said Democracy and open debate were ânot helpful.â Wait â¦ no where in the Bill of Rights is there a caveat limiting our right to free speech. Senator Allen wants us to believe that it is <i>wrong</i> to question our elected officials when our troops are at war and has suggested with his rhetoric that anyone who does question âstay the courseâ is disloyal.<br />
<br />
So, we should throw out one of our core freedoms â the right to speak our mind and question our government â because our president sent our troops into war? Just suggesting Democracy and debate are not helpful is a scary revelation.<br />
<br />
Well, that sort of flies in the face of Jefferson who absolutely believed in Democracy and debate.<br />
<br />
In his speech to the American Legion, Allen also said that having a debate on the war was not good for the morale of the troops â¦ but just a month earlier Allen, during a telephone press conference with reporters while he was in Kuwait, said the troops have âvery good moraleâ and the troops werenât affected by the political debate taking place back on the home front. Could that constitute a flip-flop?<br />
<br />
And to top it off, Allen is a chickenhawk who sat out Vietnam with student deferments. Whatâs worse, he actually has the temerity to suggest his Democratic opponent for his senate seat is unpatriotic. Jim Webb, former Marine who led a combat platoon in Vietnam and received the Navy Cross for his service, has always maintained the War in Iraq was wrong, even before the shooting started, back when the administration was phonying up intelligence to support their pre-planned invasion.<br />
<br />
It sure would be a nice change of pace if one of those news network talking heads would challenge Allen when he calls himself a âJeffersonian Conservative.â Thereâs nothing âJeffersonianâ about Allenâs political views. Who knows, maybe Allen has a mistress of African-American descent, as Jefferson did. <br />
<br />
Jefferson was also a Democrat. âReally!!??â Yes. The actual party name was âDemocrat-Republican,â which means both major political parties of today can lay some claim to our third president.<br />
<br />
Why am I picking on George Allen? Heâs the not-so-silent stalking horse in the Republican Party bid for 2008. With Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist getting mired in his own ethics questions, Senator John McCain looking like a flip-flopper (his overtures to the Religious Right and his unwavering support of the presidentâs policies), George Allen is looking like the guy on the ballot come November, 2008.<br />
<br />
If Allen is at the top of the Republican ticket in two years, we need to know his B.S. now and start pounding him, the way people are pounding Hillary Clinton. The American media is so deep in the pocket of the Republican Party right now, itâs hard to imagine George Allen getting a thorough examination in the same fashion the New York Senator receives on an almost daily basis. <font></font><br />

<font size="3" color="#000000"><font> As the war between Israel and Hezbollah rages on, the civil war in Iraq continues to escalate -- with our troops still in harmâs way. Yesterday (Tuesday, July 25) the president even suggested we should <i>send more</i> troops into Iraq to help quell the civil war taking place throughout Iraq, and most especially in Baghdad.<br />
<br />
Politicians and prognosticators seem to be shifting their focus on Iraqâs capital, but the reality is thereâs no area in Iraq safe from the violence that is taking place. The president and his minions like to point out all the places in Iraq that are âsafe,â but really, the only area that qualifies as âsafeâ is that vast, open desert where no one resides â the Syrian Desert â that region bordered by Syria and Saudi Arabia. <br />
<br />
Several months ago I was speaking with a young Marine who was just a few days away from returning to Iraq for the third time. That look in his eyes â fear â just haunts me. He returned without complaint and wouldnât even criticize the politicians who are responsible for sending him there, but he was undeniably agitated that he would be in the war zone yet again.<br />
<br />
Iâll see him again when he returns, and Iâm confident he will, but I canât stop thinking about the young man. Itâs time to really support our troops and bring them home. <font></font>
