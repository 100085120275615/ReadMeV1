<span>Letter to Bill Clinton</span>
</a>
<span>, I applauded his 10-year commitment and joint initiative with the American Heart Association to address the issue of Childhood Obesity.In my letter to Bill, I said:<br />
<br />"I have received some feedback that my small attempt to raise awareness and, hopefully, motivate others, is too singular and narrow in addressing a national problem. May I restate that there are issues, particularly those related to nutrition education and the delivery of nutritional foods in school cafeterias that should be the core of our focus. Who can refute that?"<br />
<br />With so much junk food in schools and lack of opportunities for physical activity -- our kids are paying the price with their health. So I'm working with the Stir It Up campaign, a national movement of parents bringing together everyone who cares about kids to work for healthier eating and a healthier lifestyle for all kids. It's a parents' movement that will put children first.<br />
<br />I'm hoping you'll join me. Taking action online is quick, easy, and I think it can really make a difference in our kids' lives -- check it out here:<br />

<br />Parents trying to raise healthy children today are struggling against our junk food, couch potato culture. Schools can play a key role in addressing this problem- many American schools sell soda, candy and other unhealthy meals and snacks to students and have few or no physical activity opportunities. This atmosphere has contributed to a childhood obesity crisis of startling proportions. Americaâs parents are doing something about it and you can too by joining the Stir It Up campaign, a national movement of parents working with educators and school administrators to get junk food out of our schools... and physical activity back in.<br />
<br />Join Stir It Up and parents across America by telling your Senators and Representatives to support Senator Tom Harkin's (D-IA), Senator Arlen Specter's (R-PA) and Representative Lynn Woolsey's (D-CA) bills to get junk food out of our schools. Our children's health depends on it. Act now to get the junk food out of schools.<br />
