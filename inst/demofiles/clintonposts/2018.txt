<blockquote>"In an interview Friday, she cited specific goals that could, and hopefully will, become the heart of bipartisan legislation that might actually fix this national crisis. <br />
<br />A fence or a wall? She's for it.<br />
<br />A two-step process, where our borders are secured before the 11 million illegal immigrants already here begin to get legalized? She's for that, too.<br />
<br />The sudden crackdown by Washington on employers who hire illegal immigrants? She welcomes it.<br />
<br />The work and school boycott advocacy groups are planning for May 1? She's against it."</blockquote>There's not much I loathe more than Democrats, and there's not many Democrats I loathe more than her. And I know she's just doing this to mess with the Republicans. She could give a damn less who eats up the sociofascism she craves. <em>But...</em>
<br />
<br />If this will make the Republicans second-guess themselves on the delusion that allowing gazillions of foreigners to invade in order to secure more GOP votes for the future is a good idea, then I'm all for her. Give 'em hell, Hill!</div>
