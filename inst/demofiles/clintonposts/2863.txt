<div>A staffer for Senate Minority Leader, Harry Reid, decided to do his own little protest on the West Front of the Capitol.  The Washington Times has the <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/national/20050126-114932-5400r.htm">story</a>:
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<span>About 20 minutes into Mr. Bush's speech, Mr. Ackerman, 36, and another man held up a sheet that said "No War." According to a Capitol Police report, Mr. Ackerman and another suspect "were blocking the view of the audience, and they were engaged in a verbal dispute with members of the audience."</span>
</blockquote>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<span>The report states that Capitol Police officers told Mr. Ackerman and the other suspect to relinquish the sign or be arrested, but that "neither complied and both were placed under arrest." The report did not name either suspect, although Mr. Ackerman's identity was confirmed with the Capitol Police. </span>

<br />I understand not agreeing with a president's policies but is it really appropriate for a staffer for a US Senator to stage a public protest during the inaugural address?  What does this say about the Senator he works for and represents?  There is this concept of "time and place".  Imagine what would have happened if a staffer of Sen. Trent Lott or another Republican had done the same thing during Clinton's inaugural address.  Somehow I don't think a little blurb in the Washington Times would be the only place you'd find the story.</div>
