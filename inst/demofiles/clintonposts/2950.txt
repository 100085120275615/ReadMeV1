<div>Blasphemy! Some might say. But I must clarify that I mean X-mas in the commercial sense of the word. That aside, it's Oscar time! The time of year when we forget what the hell the Golden Globes are (and who cares anyway) and talk about the real deal. Also, this is the time of year when we watch what should have watched when we had the chance, but were sidetracked and watched "Chicken Little" instead (amongst other things).<br />
<br />Anyways, as you know, Brokeback Mountain is up for 8 Oscars. Way to go! When I saw the preview, I was very interested in the movie, but was unsure if it would be well received. Brokeback Mountain is this year's Sideways: the little gem that started small but ended big (all thanks to good filmmaking and word of mouth).<br />
<br />
<span>So, who do I think is going to win? Who cares?!</span>
<br />Well, I do, so here it goes.<br />
<br />
<span>Best Actor:</span> Philip Seymour Hoffman for Capote<br />I'd like to see Joaquin Phoenix win and let's face it, Heath Ledger is not going to get it--not for lack of talent, but he's too young. But Hoffman really did the best job out of all of them.<br />
<br />
<span>Best Supporting Actor:</span> George Clooney for Syriana.<br />I'd like to see Paul Giamatti win (he was robbed last year), but sadly I don't think he's got a chance. He's too much of an underdog.<br />
<br />
<span>Best Actress:</span> Reese Witherspoon for Walk the Line<br />Her performance has Oscar written all over it. Charlize Theron and Judy Dench already have Oscras, but given recent trends, that doesn't stop people from voting for them (Hillary Swank, Julia Roberts), so they might pose a threat.<br />
<br />
<span>Best Supporting Actress:</span> Rachel Weiz for The Contsant Gardener<br />That's who I think's going to win, but I really wish Michelle Williams (Brokeback Mountain) would win. She's come a long way since Dawson's Creek.<br />
<br />
<span>Best Director:</span> Ang Lee for Brokeback Mountain<br />Though I wish Paul Haggis would win for Crash.<br />
<br />
<span>Best Picture:</span> This is actually a tough one. Capote was excellent, Brokeback Mountain was groundbreaking and Crash is relevant today and dared to talk about things that no one else was talking about. Given the number of nominations, it is obvious that Brokeback Mountain is going to win. Although Capote might surprise us.<br />
<br />
<span>Movies I think were robbed or forgotten:</span>
<br />The Constant Gardener should have been nominated for Cinematography. That movie was one of the most beautifully photographed films I have ever seen. It should also have been nominated for Best Picture. That was one of the best movies of 2005. Heck, it was the best movie of the summer. Ralph Fiennes should also have been nominated for best actor.<br />
<br />The Weatherman should also have been nominated for Cinematography. Man, those shots with the ice and the arrow are absolutely breathtaking. I thought the cinematography in that movie was brilliant and very interesting. But if people cared what I thought, I wouldn't be writing here now, would I?</div>
