You can tell the reviewers who had read Maureen Dowd's book <i>Are Men Necessary?</i> from those who hadn't.  The ones who hadn't say stuff like "Feminism isn't your dating service," based on the very first review that came out (they all did read that), which cattily hinted that Dowd is a spinster because she doesn't deserve to be married.  <br /><br />Kathleen at autopolitica has <a href="http://autopolitica.blogspot.com/2005/11/get-thee-to-editor-maureen-dowd.html">clearly read</a> the <i>whole book</i>.  She doesn't reduce a book that addresses a number of subjects concerning modern men and women to a Cosmo quiz.<br /><br />For example, this passage rings true:<br /><blockquote>Americans like to see women who wear the pants beaten up and humiliated. Afterward, in a gratifying redemption ritual, people like to see the battered women rewarded.<br /><br />That's how Hilary Swank won two Oscars. That's how Hillary Clinton won a Senate seat and a presidential front-runner spot. And that's how Martha Stewart won her own reality show and became a half billion dollars richer while she was in prison.</blockquote><br />I hope America cuts out the middle man in the pants-beating-reward continuum soon.
