<span>"WASHINGTON -- Members of the inner circle of high-ranking House Republicans privately agree that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York is an absolute lock for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination and will not be easy to defeat in the general election.</span>
</p> <span> </span> <p>
<span> The same lawmakers believe the Republican race to oppose Clinton is wide open but regard Sen. George Allen of Virginia as having the edge over Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee. The consensus among them is that Allen is a better candidate than Frist and will the advantage over him in GOP primaries. The House members see little or no prospect for former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, Sen. John McCain of Arizona or Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney."<br />
</span>
</p> <p>
<span>I'm not sure if Hillary is a lock for the nomination, though we should find out by March 2006, when she will have announced whether or not she's running. The same for Senator Allen. He's somewhat unknown on the national stage. He isn't registering on any of the national polls for the nomination, but neither did Bill Clinton.<br />
</span>
</p> <p>
<span>However, if Evan Bayh were to win the Democratic nomination and Allen the Republican nomination, it would make for an interesting race.<br />
