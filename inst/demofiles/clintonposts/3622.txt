<div>The last few weeks have been busily spent preparing for Vacation Bible School.  From canvassing and handing our fliers to teen activities to create decorations for VBS, we have had a lot of fun.  Here are some of the pictures in preparing for our Journey to Knighthood (the theme of the Vacation Bible School).<br />

<br />It has been a blessing to have so many from the church willing to volunteer their time to not only help run VBS, but to prepare the church, go door to door, and pick up kids to bring to Bible School.</div>
