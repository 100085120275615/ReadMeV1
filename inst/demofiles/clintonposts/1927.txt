<br />The South Park episodes this season have been hilarious. The demise of Chef (above) brought howls of laughter to our household. We watched with smiles as San Francisco was destroyed by Smug. We derided Comedy Central when they caved in and refused to show the cartoon image of Mohammed.<br />
<br />Last week's episode with Oprah Winfrey was bland. You can't be funny all the time.<br />
<br />The current episode has Al Gore in an Ahab-like pursuit of the mythical Manbearpig. This was great political humor, showing what a pompous and unimportant ass the former vice-president is.<br />
<br />I hope that, at the right time, South Park comes out with an episode on Hillary Clinton, and shows her in her true light.</div>
