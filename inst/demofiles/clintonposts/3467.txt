<div>One of the publications I have been reading for years is the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a>.  (Subscription required.)  I read it for the financial and investment news, and have found the paper a font of good advice and self-education on personal finance.  (I credit what I learned from the Journal, in concert with the booming economy of the Clinton years, for the comfortable retirement I am enjoying right now--perhaps enjoying too much, if my liver is any indication.)  But I rarely look at the editorial page and opinion columns, because I learned long ago that the conservative views found there were more apt to raise my blood pressure than my awareness.<br />
<br />But I deviated from this pattern this morning, and read an op-ed piece by Daniel Henninger, the paper's deputy editorial page editor.  The piece, titled "Democrats Knife Lieberman on Eve of Airliner Plot" parrots the Neocon Republicans' talking points, specifically the way it links the Bush administration's Iraq misadventure with the war on terror.  In the author's view, Tuesday's vote by Connecticut Democrats in denying the Senator their party's renomination was an act of immaturity on their part, and by staking out a firm position as the antiwar party they are making a grave political error.  He asks a few questions:<br />
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote>The Connecticut Democrats "support the war on terror but are merely against George Bush's war in Iraq. How does that work?"<br />--Because one has nothing to do with the other.  Next question?<br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote>"From the perspective as of yesterday of getting on a U.S. airliner, who would you rather have in the Senate formulating policy toward this threat -- Ned Lamont or Joe Lieberman?"<br />--Lamont, for this reason:  as far as the war on terror is concerned, the core issue for me (I used to be a centrist--actually center-right--but have moved to the left) is really one of competence in fighting it, and Senator Lieberman has been steadfast in his commitment to the Bush administration's incompetence. </blockquote> I am not alone in how I rate the administration's handling of the terror threat:  a poll published just a few days ago showed that fully two-thirds of the American people think we are either losing the war to the terrorists or neither side is winning--in other words, we are <span>not </span>winning it.   If anything, the details surrounding the smashing of the plot is further evidence of the fallacy of linking Iraq with the war on terror:  despite Bush's insistence on fighting terror by military means, it was good old-fashioned police work by Scotland Yard that uncovered the terrorist plot.<br />
<br />Now I'd like to pose a few questions:<br />
<br />--If immigration policy is so key to our nation's security (and I agree that it is), why are our borders still so porous?<br />
<br />--Why are only about 5% of shipping containers coming into the US from overseas checked for possible WMDs?<br />
<br />--Since our own national security is reliant on the health of our economy, why is that economy so dependent on our debt to other nations, such as China?  I love the Chinese culture, language and people, and usually cringe at the often ill-informed opinions of China-bashers both in the government and media.  But with our economy so closely tied to a country with which we have a tenuous political relationship, one that could be ruptured should a major international dispute arise, I wonder what would be our government's reaction if China invaded Taiwan?  We do not have the manpower to fight a ground war in Asia, and bombing and destroying China's economy would certainly have a devastating effect on our own.  At the present, the only thing protecting us from having no choice but to stand by helplessly is Taiwan's own forebearance in not declaring independence, the one thing that China has repeatedly vowed would trigger military action on its part.<br />
<br />--How is it immaturity on the Democrats' part to reject their own office-holders who blindly support incompetence and call it "bipartisanship"?  (We have a Senate race here in Minnesota in which the GOP nominee, Representative Mark Kennedy, is trying to portray himself as a maverick independent of the White House.  Horsepucky:  he's been a Bush lap dog, and his voting record proves it.)<br />
<br />--Finally, how can a government demand war support from its people when it uses that war to take away so many of their basic rights and freedoms, even when they have little or no connection with national security?  Bipartisan actions engender bipartisan reactions, but this President just doesn't get it.<br />
<br />Some years ago I read a brilliant satirical novel called "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0802130208/103-4369873-4661401?v=glance&n=283155">A Confederacy of Dunces</a>", which was set in New Orleans in the 1960s.  I never could have foreseen that the title would some day become a reality.  Problem is, the setting this time is Washington, and sadly it's not fiction.</div>
