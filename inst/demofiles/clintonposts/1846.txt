<br />Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez blew it in the NSA hearings.<br />
<br />When the liberal Senator and Presidential hopeful Russ Feingold sat there and smirked, like he knew Gonzalez was a fool, and then accused him of lying to Congress, Gonzalez should have said the following:<br />
<br />âSenators on the left, I am going to tell you something that is so politically incorrect, but is so much the truth, it will probably make your heads spin.<br />We are in World War 4, the Cold war being World War 3 for those of you on the left who missed that fact while you were talking disarmament with the Soviet Union.<br />But listen to me now.<br />The Islamic Fascists are trying to take over the world.<br />More so than the Soviet Union ever wanted to.<br />The riots in Europe over cartoons,<em> cartoons</em> for God sakes, shows just how angry and dedicated the Islamic radicals are.<br />They will not stop until they have defeated the U.S and the West.<br />You liberals will not realize this until it bites you in the ass.<br />Forget âillegalâ wiretapping and the ârightsâ of detainees.<br />You need to be concerned with the fact that the Islamic fascists are willing to do WHATEVER it takes to destroy us.<br />Until you do you so YOU are aiding and abetting the enemy and ignoring reality.<br />YOU are helping the Islamofacists and will be held responsible when this leads to another 9/11.<br />This is your warning.â<br />
<br />Gonzalez would have been right to do this.<br />
<br />Every religion but Islam is fair game for liberal attacks.<br />
<br />The world is at a brink.<br />
<br />Iran is ready for a nuclear war, Russia is helping them, Bolivia and Venezuela are under control of Castro-like communists, Europe is unwilling to stop the violence and the liberals in the United States are acting as if this is a political game.<br />
<br />The last time we played this game under the Clinton administration, one that was afraid to go after terrorists as a war but more like a legal problem, it led to flight 93 going down, the Pentagon being hit and the World Trade center being destroyed along with 3000 American citizens.<br />
<br />How soon we forget.<br />
<br />But I have not forgotten, and neither have the Islamofacists.<br />
<br />There was a sign at the protests held by the Islamofacists while they burned the Danish embassy yesterday.<br />It read: âEurope must learn from 9/11!â<br />
<br />If that is not a declaration of World War, what is?<br />
<br />I have a liberal friend who text messaged me last night saying:<br />â Are you taping the impeachment hearings tomorrow?â<br />He meant the NSA Terrorist Surveillance Program hearings from today.<br />
<br />That is the problem with the left. They look at EVERYTHING as a political game and a way to attack President Bush. They believe Bush broke the law monitoring the terrorists who are plotting in this country to repeat 9/11. They think FINALLY this will be the end of President Bush.<br />
<br />I emailed back my friend that this hearing would end up like the Alito Supreme Court hearings with Kennedy, Shumer and Feingold looking like fools, and that is what happened.<br />
<br />The liberals just donât get it, and never will.<br />
<br />Everything they look at is through the prism of âHow do we get Bush today?â<br />Instead they should be looking at âHow do we stop the terrorists todayâ.<br />
<br />But that would mean they would have to stop politicizing this war on terror.<br />
<br />Canât have that, can we? Must stop the evil Bush regime.<br />
<br />Former President Carter has said the NSA program is illegal.<br />This from the man who gave us the Iran Hostage Crisis because he was too afraid to confront the terrorists like President Bush is.<br />Maybe if Carter had done his job then the Islamofascists would know we are not fair game for their attacks today.<br />
<br />In Matworld the Democrats realize this is a long term World War and that they are hurting the effort.<br />They also stop attacking Bush about everything just for political reasons.<br />
<br />The Democrat party is self-destructing and they know it. That is why they canât stop this downward spiral. They have to try and appease the Michael Moore wing of the party that gives them so much money.<br />
<br />In Matworld the long term health of the United States is what matters, not petty political attacks and insane arguments from the Taliban wing of the Democrat party.<br />
<br />But I may as well hope to win the lottery if I expect common sense from the liberals.<br />
<br />Once again they have overreached and donât realize it.<br />
<br />One more step to the Democrat party becoming irrelevant in the political world, and in the United States.<br />
<br />PS: Need more proof of the self destruction of the Democrat party? Just look at Coretta Scott King's "funeral" today. Jimmy Carter and the Democrats attacked President Bush on WMD's , Katrina and "Wiretapping" while President Bush was sitting right there. At a funeral! Low class and desperate. They are losing it a piece at a time. MTI<br />
