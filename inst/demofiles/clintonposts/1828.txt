</a>The one thing attentive people in Tennessee know at this time is that their next Senator will be either Bob Corker or Harold Ford. If youâre a Democrat or a Republican, you know this to be true. If youâre happy with the nominee of your respective party, or not, you know this to be true.<br />
<br />Itâs Bob or Harold.<br />

<br />And while Iâm at it, I might as well note that, in all likelihood, the winner of this race will hold the senate seat for as long as he desires. Iâve heard the talk on the part of some conservatives about sitting this race out, letting Harold win, and running a âtrueâ or âmovementâ conservative against him in 2012.<br />
<br />But letâs face facts.<br />
<br />Should Harold Ford win in 2006, whoever runs against him in 2012 will be running against an entrenched incumbent with tremendous financial resources. The Republican with the best chance of defeating Harold Ford in a Senate race for the foreseeable future is Bob Corker in 2006.<br />

<br />This is especially important for many Republicans in the state to keep in mind, as they are coming off of one of the most bitterly fought primary campaigns in memory. There are many nerves and feelings left raw, now that that particular battle has concluded. There are many disappointed activists, now that their candidate has been eliminated.<br />
<br />And that would have been the case, no matter who would have won. Things would be no different in that regard if Ed Bryant or Van Hilleary would have won. And if that were the case, the nominee in question would be desperately hoping that those who had opposed him in the primary campaign would find it in their heart to set aside previous differences in order to ensure that their party still holds the seat come next January.<br />
<br />Which is, of course, what Bob Corker hopes for now. As the front-runner in the closing weeks of the campaign, he was subject to the expected attacks from the other campaigns that hoped to find the chink in his armor that would make him vulnerable on election day. And as hard as it may be for members of those campaigns to change gears and support him in the general election campaign, this is what he needs to defeat Congressman Ford.<br />
<br />As Ed Bryant said consistently during his campaign, the Republicans underestimate Harold Ford, Jr. as a candidate at their own peril. He has the support of Hollywood. He has the support of the Democratsâ most effective fundraisers â the Clintons. He is an attractive young man. He is charismatic. He has the benefit of a powerful political machine operating out of Memphis to propel his candidacy across the state.<br />
<br />And he stands to become the next U.S. Senator from Tennessee, should Republicans fail to unite behind Bob Corker. Once entrenched in Bill Fristâs seat, we can reasonably expect Harold to set aside the conservative persona he will take on during the campaign so that he can satisfy the wishes of his most ardent benefactors â who happen to be located in Hollywood and New York. And if you want to know what type of representation they will expect from him, just look at who they have elected in their own states.<br />
<br />Having said all that, I suppose it comes as no surprise to hear me say that I will be supporting Bob Corker in the general election campaign, though I did not during the primary campaign â a fact that a position I hold made it improper for me to reveal prior to this time.<br />
<br />Certainly, I welcome any input from other conservatives who can provide me with evidence that Bob will prove to be another Lincoln Chafee, but it seems that those who would do so have their work cut out for themselves. The positions he has staked out in the primary campaign certainly place him closer to the âconservativeâ column than the âliberalâ or even âmoderateâ one. Not that we are in complete agreement on everything, mind you. But, apparently unlike some, there are issues upon which I am willing to allow that reasonable people can come to different conclusions upon.<br />
<br />And, yes, as some have repeatedly pointed out, it may well be that he has arrived âlate to the conservative partyâ on some issues. But I, for one, am willing to grant that a person whose position on an issue has changed from a previously more liberal one can be just as sincere in his current belief as someone who felt the same way all along. It matters less to me what a candidate said about any issue years ago than what he is saying now. Any conservative who disagrees with me on that must be willing to join the chorus of liberals who held Strom Thurmond to be a racist until the end of his days.<br />
<br />We are still much closer to primary election day â five days, at this writing â than we are to general election day â 91 days. There is time to let emotions cool and rationally evaluate where we are in Tennessee. But let me go ahead and add my voice to that of others who would urge my fellow conservatives to no longer fret over what might have been had other candidates â who are personal friends in many cases â won the primary, and start cultivating a good relationship with the candidate who just may prove to be a good friend as well, if we will let him.</div>
