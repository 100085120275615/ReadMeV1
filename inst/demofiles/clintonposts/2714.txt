<div><p>Hillary had better watch out. </p>

<p>As <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2006/05/feingold_says_its_time_for_dem.html">reported</a> by Chris Cillizza of the WP, Russ Feingold is talking tough -- much tougher than almost anyone else from whatâs supposed to be, after all, the party of progressive opposition to this nationâs military-industrial, Big Brother plutocracy.</p>

<p><em>In a speech at the National Press Club [Monday], the Wisconsin senator focused heavily on the need for Democrats to buck the Bush administration on security issues -- ranging from the Patriot Act to the warrantless wiretapping program to the war in Iraq -- and sought to deliver a direct rebuttal of White House Deputy chief of staff Karl Roveâs assertion that Democrats have a "pre-September 11 world view."<br />

<p>"Many Democrats and others around this country want us to point out that the White House actually has a pre-1776 perspective and we ought to have the guts to point that out," Feingold said to laughter and applause.</p>

<p>"You don't hear this stand up language here in this town," he said. "The consultants and the pundits and others will tell you that those positions are quote 'losers'... and that it is dangerous to let there be any light between our position and the White House position, or else you'll get called soft on terrorism."</em></p>

<p>Feingoldâs unnamed âothersâ undoubtedly include Senator Clinton, who long ago weighed thoughtful policy and real security against whatever electoral advantage might be had. </p>

<p>But Hillary was too clever too soon and for too long. She rode the Iraq war hysteria past its expiration date and will now have a tricky time retreating from what virtually all progressives three years ago saw as a <em>long</em>-term, politically foolish position.</p>

<p>Cillizza insightfully notes the upcoming problem for Hillary:</p>

<p><em>Feingold's message of change from without and his consistent opposition to the war in Iraq present an intriguing profile heading into 2008, especially in the Iowa caucuses where his anti-war stance and Midwestern roots should provide him a foothold.</em></p>

<p>All Russ needs is cash. Small item. </p>

<p>In the end Feingold may not be the one to give Clinton a run for all her money. I am convinced, however, that someone -- Al, are you listening? -- left of center will, and that the pundits are prematurely, and wrongly, vesting Hillary with owning this thing.<br />
