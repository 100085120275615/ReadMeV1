<span>What should a drug reformer say about a  user of illegal drugs?  Does it matter if the drug user is Rush Limbaugh, Noelle  Bush, John M. Fabrizi, the mayor of Bridgeport, CT, Tommy Chong, or some  ordinary citizen?<br />
<br />We donât believe that people should be punished by the  government for using drugs.  Noelle Bush, Tommy Chong, and ordinary citizens do  not hold public office.  They have no responsibility for serving the  public.<br />
<br />The issue regarding a public official, such as Mayor John  Fabrizi, is not so much the question of whether he or she is one of the twenty  million or so Americans who currently use illegal drugs, or the 100 million who  have done so in the past.  The issue more precisely is whether he or she has  integrity.<br />
<br />Simply breaking the law is not a measure of integrity. A  public official who, letâs say, fails to recycle when required to do so, or  throws litter from their car, is a slob or is selfish and lazy, but does not  demonstrate a failure of  integrity that disqualifies him for  office.<br />
<br />This is not an issue about whether the public official may have  had impaired judgment in making an official decision. During World War II,  Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, was consuming a quart of whiskey  or more per day. U.S. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was widely rumored to have  been a very heavy drinker. Even impaired, their judgment was superior to that of  most of us.<br />
<br />Integrity has to do with truth telling and intellectual  honesty.  Is the official trustworthy?  When Bill Clinton had sex with Monica  Lewinsky, his cheating on his wife revealed his low character, but that did not  disqualify him from holding office. But when he committed perjury â lying in an  official proceeding under oath â regarding his sex acts with Lewinsky, he  demonstrated a lack of integrity that would have compelled an honorable man to  resign, and would have motivated a political party of integrity to demand his  resignation.  However, while perjury was a blot on Clintonâs integrity and the  Democrats who did not call upon him to resign, perjury did not rise to the level  that warranted an impeachment.  It did not constitute high crimes and  misdemeanors.<br />
<br />Bridgeport Mayor Fabrizi has, admitted a history of cocaine  use, and we presume he is telling the truth. Like millions of other Americans he  broke the drug law. But drug policy reformers hold that this law is itself  wrong. People should not be punished simply for what they put in their  bodies.<br />
<br />The test of Mayor Fabriziâs integrity therefore rests now upon  his intellectual honesty. Is he a man of principle and conviction, or merely an  ambitious opportunist?  A test of integrity is measured by how he speaks about  the drug laws he violated.<br />
<br />Does he say, âI violated the drug laws. It is  not good to violate the laws. But these laws are wrong and should be changed. I  cannot support a law that punishes thousands of others in Connecticut for the  conduct I engaged in, when I â and they â have not hurt anyone in a way that the  law is entitled to punish. For example, I hurt my kids and wife when I lied to  them and broke my promises to them. But the law does not punish a father or  husband who breaks his promises to his family.  I hurt my supporters and  undermined the faith of citizens in the integrity of their government when I  admitted that I broke the drug laws. Those hurt feelings and loss of faith in  government or me does not warrant punishment by the state.â<br />
<br />But if the  Mayor says, âMy violation of the drug law doesnât really count. More  importantly, I continue to support those laws that send people who use drugs  like me to prison â but I should not go to prison. In fact, I should not even  lose my job for doing this thing that <u>should</u> send people to prison.â If  that is the Mayorâs position, then he demonstrates the lack of intellectual  honesty and integrity that warrants his removal from office.<br />
<br />I repeat: I  am not calling for his resignation or removal from office because he used drugs.  Breaking a stupid and counterproductive law that has been disregarded by almost  100 million Americans is not ground for forcing the Mayor from office.<br />
<br />If  he is a hypocrite, intellectually dishonest, and lacking in integrity, then I  call for his resignation from office. A man who insists that other people should  be punished for what he did and insists  simultaneously that he does not warrant  punishment has no moral compass â he lacks the intellectual honesty that  warrants entrusting him with the publicâs business.  Such a man would have no  scruple insisting that wrongful acts â theft or bribery, for example â that  ought to apply to others should not apply to him.<br />
<br />I am not calling for  his prosecution. Oneâs attitude about the rightness or wrongness of a law does  not, by itself, determine whether a prosecution is just.  If Mayor Fabrizi is  prosecuted, I urge him to seek jury nullification â to argue directly to the  jury that law is wrong when it punishes a person simply for using drugs, and to  ask the jury to find him not guilty.  I urge him to demand that the prosecution  justify the law to the jury â that it demonstrate the drug law reduces crime and  protects public health. I have no doubt that any jury given the facts and the  opportunity to judge the wisdom of this law will acquit those simply charged  with drug possession.</span>
