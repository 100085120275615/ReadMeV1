<div>The Bull Moose <a href="http://bullmooseblogger.blogspot.com/2006/06/hes-no-hanna.html">posts</a> a piece today on the politics of realignment, contrasting today's GOP POTUS and his political wizard with the Republican president of a century ago, William McKinley, and his key advisor, Mark Hanna.  According to the Moose, Rove's long-held belief that GWB is McKinley-incarnate has been proven incorrect, with Bush/Rove failing to replicate the long-term GOP realignment McKinley and Hanna produced at the turn of the last century.  I couldn't disagree more, and I find the Moose's post to be, quite frankly, a lot of bull.<br />
<br />The Moose begins with the following premise:<br />
<br />
<em>"Rove has fashioned himself as a modern Mark Hanna. Hanna created the McKinley candidacy by...manufacturing a..."different kind of Republican" who was compassionate and reached out to new immigrant groups."</em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />Fair enough.  You did your research, Moose.  Tell us more.<br />
<br />
<em>"Alas, it was not to be for W." </em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />Wait.  So GWB <em>isn't</em> a compassionate Republican who reaches out to new immigrant groups?  Um, weren't these very themes, you know, at the <strong>
<em>core</em>
</strong> of Bush's presidential runs? I'm just saying...  Well, let's give the Moose a chance to explain himself.<br />
<em></em>
<br />
<em>"While McKinley rode a Republican ascendancy and steered a centrist course, Bush has governed from the right and may be presiding over the end of GOP dominance."</em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />McKinley was a centrist?  And that explains why he won two close elections that were mirror images of Bush's 2000 and 2004 victories?  At this point, the Moose turns to James Traub of the NYT, focusing on Traub's description of the McKinley era in an effort to illustrate all the ways in which that era differs from today's political climate.  Let's examine some of Traub's statements:<br />
<br />
<em>"First of all, McKinley was facing a particularly hapless generation of Democrats."</em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />Um.  And that's different from Pelosi/Reid/Gore/Kerry/Hillary how? <br />
<br />Traub next addresses McKinley's first election in 1896.<br />
<br />
<em>"...the </em>(Democratic) <em>party took a decisive turn to the left in 1896 by choosing the populist Bryan..."</em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />Just replace "1896" with "2000" and "Bryan" with "Gore" and you still have a true statement.<br />
<br />
<em>"...</em>(Bryan)<em> ran again in 1900 and 1908."</em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />Well, Gore didn't run again in 2004, but a Gore clone by the name of John Kerry did.  Those two basically won all the same states.  And the leftist base of the Democratic Party is now touting a Gore run for 2008.  Once again, I'm not seeing the vast differences in these periods that apparently both Traub and Moose are cognizant of.  What gives?  Okay, maybe the differences are on the GOP side.  Let's see what Traub has to say about McKinley's GOP.<br />
<br />
<em>"Second, while McKinley had the good fortune to arrive at the dawn of a new era, Bush came along three decades after Republicans broke into the Democrats' solid South to establish a new majority."</em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />Hmm.  McKinley didn't really arrive at the dawn of anything.  The Republican coalition was 36 years into a majority status that had been ushered in by Lincoln.  By the time McKinley came to power, the country was divided almost perfectly along regional lines, with the south and west voting Democratic and the north and east voting Republican.  This is how McKinley won both of his elections --- with his second victory being slightly bigger than his first.  If anything, it looked as if McKinley was presiding over the end of GOP rule until Teddy Roosevelt changed the map in 1904 by turning the broad west red.  It was the equivalent of, say, Rudy Giuliani winning the GOP nod in 2008 and bringing in the vast, purple northern midwest over to the Republican column. <br />
<br />The problem with both Moose and Traub is that each is viewing history retrospectively instead of attempting to imagine what history would've looked like at this point during McKinley's reign.  Prior to TR's 1904 victory, Taft's rout in 1908, and GOP dominance of government for the next couple of decades, many political observers of the time probably questioned McKinley's effectiveness as a party-builder and at least a few likely opined that the twilight of the Lincoln coalition was upon the nation. It had been nearly four decades since Lincoln, Democrats had won the White House twice in recent years with the very successful Grover Cleveland, McKinley couldn't quite figure out how to play to the west or south, and America appeared to be a nation with an ever-so-slight Republican edge.  Despite what Moose and Traub think, this is <em>exactly</em> the political environment we're currently dealing with.  All Republicans need is another Teddy Roosevelt to break the modern-day red/blue divide wide open and bring the Reagan Democrats from the industrial north back to the GOP with a promise of leaner, smarter government, fiscal responsibility, and a government that responds to their very real concerns in a conservative way.</div>
