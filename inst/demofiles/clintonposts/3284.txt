<div>In a presidential election between Rudy Giuliani and Hillary Clinton, who would you vote for?<br />
<br />Me, I just don't think we're ready for a female president, so I'd vote for Hillary Clinton. Plus, a vote for Hillary would privilege the grounds of any criticism: "Hey, I voted for her and I <em>still</em> think she's doing a crappy job."<br />
<br />Oh yeah. I would just <em>exude</em> moral authority, like so much unexpected lactation. I could solemnly proclaim my disenchantment <em>mere seconds</em> after she takes office. Blogs would form around me, a veritable personality cult, as I picketed the presidential inauguration "and I even voted for her!"<br />
<br />Groundswells of support, Hannity and Colmes guest-slots, my own local radio show called "The Grant Recant," featuring a catalogue of criticisms I have with the new nascent presidency, "which I even <em>voted for."</em>
<br />
<br />I don't think its unrealistic to speculate a 2008 Republican ticket for myself in this hypothetical scenario, as a moderate that reached across the aisle. And then, when election time comes, <em>I'd vote for the other guy again. </em>

<br />Okay, my miniature, deep dish pizzas are done now.</div>
