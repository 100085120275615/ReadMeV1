Coyote, Daffy Duck, and Elmer Fudd</em><br /><em>b) The Supreme Court of Florida</em><br /><em>c) Mr. Bean</em><br /><em>d) Muslim male extremists mostly between the ages of 17 and 40</em></strong><br /><br />The humor of this <a href="http://www.mideasttruth.com/profiling.html" target="_blank">parody-quiz</a> comes not from answer <em>d</em>, but from the realization that some Americans <a href="http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&pk=CONSPIRACY-08-02-06" target="_blank">arenât sure</a>.<br /><br />Itâs not that those people are stupid. After all, if I pressed <em>Gore-Lieberman</em> bumper-stickers to their foreheads they would probably know who did it. Their stupidity is not a consequence of prenatal trauma or genetic mutation, but of a deliberate refusal to accept the obvious out of fear of appearing judgmental or racist (yikes!).<br /><br />It is bad enough when white cops ignore brown gang members to avoid false racial complaints, but when Americaâs elected leaders and institutions implement costly and unnecessary procedures to avoid offending a few Muslims, the great majority of cooperative Americans suffer civil rights violations far more unreasonable and intrusive than the handful of false complaints that TSA hopes to avoid.<br /><br />Think of it this way: If LAPD Chief William Bratton ordered cops to conduct thousands of random vehicle searches (red-car Monday, green-car Tuesday, etc.) in the hopes of finding a cache of drugs or weapons, <a href="http://www.rotten.com/library/bio/black-sheep/uday-hussein" target="_blank">Uday and Qusay Hussein</a> would leap from their graves to decry Brattonâs reckless trampling of human rights.<br /><br />As absurd as this scenario is, this is precisely what the Transportation Security Administration (<a href="http://www.tsa.gov/" target="_blank">TSA</a>) has done since 9/11. To avoid offending a mouthy minority of indignant Muslim passengers, the TSA randomly gropes and fondles millions of grandparents and children at a cost of billions of dollars each year.<br /><br />Iâm not advocating the loss of common sense either. But when air marshals detained Army Lt. Col. <a href="http://www.aclu.org/safefree/general/16806prs20030731.html" target="_blank">Bob Rajcoomar</a>, their mistreatment of him identified TSAâs inferior training and supervision, rather than some form of racial profiling.<br /><br />To understand what racial profiling is, one must first understand <a href="http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/315/315lect06.htm" target="_blank">probable cause</a>.<br /><br /><span>Probable Cause</span><br /><br />As it pertains to stopping and searching individuals, a police officer must have a <em>reasonable</em> suspicion that 1) a crime is or has occurred, and 2) that an individual is connected to it. Unless these two elements exist, police officers have no right to detain someone.<br /><br />To explain further, letâs say that several tall, blond women have robbed Korean tourists in Korea Town ATMs in the past two weeks. As I patrol the area, I spot a tall blond woman standing behind a line of Koreans waiting to use the ATM. When I detain her, she admits that she does not have a bank account and is âwaiting for a friend.â She appears nervous. I search her purse and discover a handgun, credit cards, and ID of a Korean man who was recently robbed.<br /><br />Had I been forced to ignore the womanâs hair, gender, and complexion, I would not have the probable cause to approach her. But because I considered her race and complexion, profiling allowed me to ignore the dozen Koreans standing in line who werenât suspected, so I could focus on the blond who was. But if TSA was in on the arrest, they would have searched the Korean women to make it look fair.<br /><br /><span>Let's Profile</span><br /><br />If Iâm looking for three blonds, racial profiling lets me ignore millions of brunettes. If Iâm screening for Muslim men between the ages of 17 and 40, I can exclude millions of soldiers, grandparents, and red-haired girls named Chelsea â at least until al Qaeda operatives start changing their names. And when they do, letâs pray that TSA will properly train screeners and air marshals to question Osama look-alikes named Chelsea.<br /><br />And until Michael Moore and Hillary Clinton embrace Jihad and threaten to blow themselves up on airplanes, thereâs no reason to confiscate their creams and lubricants.
