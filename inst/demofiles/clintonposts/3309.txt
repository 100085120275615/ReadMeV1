<div>It is so seldom that a Lotus-Eater crib sheet like the ultra-lib<a href="http://daveinboca.blogspot.com">http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-walmart23aug23,0,2463162.story?coll=la-opinion-center"&gt;Los Angeles Times</a> has a sensible editorial that this one is worth reprinting in full.<br />

<strong>Democrats' Shameful Wal-Mart Demonization</strong>
<br />Presidential hopefuls only hurt themselves when pandering to unions by bashing the country's largest employer.<br />
<br />WITH ONE EYE ON 2008 and one on their labor union base, Democratic luminaries are canvassing Iowa and other states this summer to campaign against the nation's incumbent Â¡K retailer. They obviously see Wal-Mart as this season's Enron, the one corporation that represents all that is wrong with America. <br />
<br />Too bad the party can't simply draft Costco or Target to run for president. Instead, Democratic presidential aspirants Â¡X including Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana, former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico Â¡X feel compelled to bash one company, the largest employer in the U.S., to score points with labor organizers. The candidates are so intent on gaining tactical advantage in the primary season that they risk alienating possible supporters in the general election.<br />
<br />ADVERTISEMENT<br />Most Americans do not want their politicians ganging up on one company. Wal-Mart may be a behemoth that employs 1.3 million people in this country and earned $11 billion in profit last year, but it still looks like bullying when politicians single out one business to scapegoat for larger societal ills. And when they start passing laws aimed at their scapegoat Â¡X as the Maryland Legislature did when it passed legislation forcing Wal-Mart to spend a certain amount on employee healthcare Â¡X the judiciary rightly balks. A federal judge struck down the regulation, holding that it violates laws requiring equal treatment of employers. <br />
<br />But there is no stopping the campaign rhetoric. At an anti-Wal-Mart rally last week in Iowa, Biden noted that the retailer pays people $10 an hour, and then asked: "How can you live a middle-class life on that?" It's clearly the company's fault, at least from a skewed senatorial perspective, that all Americans cannot live a comfortable middle-class life. How dare it pay prevailing retail wages? Bayh, who appeared at another rally, was quoted as saying that Wal-Mart is "emblematic of the anxiety around the country." That may be true. But if it's the emblem he's worried about, he should stay in Washington and work to make healthcare more affordable for working families.<br />
<br />The gusto with which even moderate Democrats are bashing Wal-Mart is bound to backfire. Not only does it take the party back to the pre-Clinton era, when Democrats were perceived as reflexively anti-business, it manages to make Democrats seem like out-of-touch elitists to the millions of Americans who work and shop at Wal-Mart. <br />
<br />One reason the Democrats may have a tin ear on this subject is demographic. Certainly most of the party's urban liberal activists are far removed from the Wal-Mart phenomenon. The retailer has thrived mainly in small towns and exurbs, which is one reason a Zogby poll found that three-quarters of weekly Wal-Mart shoppers voted for President Bush in 2004, and why 8 out of 10 people who have never shopped at Wal-Mart voted for John Kerry. Denouncing the retailer may make sense if the goal is to woo primary activists, but it's a disastrous way to reach out to the general electorate. Or to govern, for that matter.</blockquote>
<br />Tin ear, tone deaf, politically regressive Democrat Party candidate-wannabes are simply stuck on pandering to constituencies and elites.<br />
<br />Left un-noticed by the eagle-eyed mainstream media is that Wal-Mart's nearest competitor, Target, is largely owned by the Dayton family of Minneapolis, whose scion is an ultra-left Senator from Minnesota.  Plus Target's Board of Directors and banking is riddled with <em>nomenklatura</em> Democrats like James Johnson and Richard Holbrooke.  This operation might be a Trojan Horse to benefit the Democrat hyper-elite, while throwing a bone to unionists and other cronies.</div>
