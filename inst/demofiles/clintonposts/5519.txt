Okay, I think I've found myself a new hero. Bill Clinton! Dude's like 50 maybe older and he's still passing around chicks like dubies. How cool is that? <a href="http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=2&subID=578&amp;WT.srch=1">Bubba latest conquest? Canadian Politician Belinda Stronach</a>. The best part is that not only is Belinda one hell of an upgrade on his last public fornication (Monica Lewinsky) but he's comming awful close to achieving a full contintent power bitch tri-fecta. That's right. The most powerful woman in the states; Hillary Clinton (bitch ain't goin' nowhere, regardless of Bill's fornication) Canada; Belinda (and she's way hotter than Hillary) now alll Bubba needs is a powerful Mexican broad... Who's that chick who played Zorro's wife in the movie? Selma Hayek!! There we go, I'm sure Bill could hit that shit.<br /><br />This is ofcourse is assuming that the rumors about Bill &amp; Belinda are true. They're probably not though. I was just jumping the gun a bit... I do that.
