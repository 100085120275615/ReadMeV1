<p class="MsoNormal">Well, theyâve been found.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Again.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Or rather weâve finally learned of the find.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Makes you wonder how many times it needs to happen, before they get it.<span> It's not as if we didn't have <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/783pliue.asp">cause to worry</a>.   </span>
<span>
<span>
</span>And was there something especially law-abiding and honorable in Husseinâs character, that would make anyone think that in this one particular he would honor his surrender treaty, his agreements and the sanctions?<span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Heâd bribe officials, harbor terrorists and blast away at our planes on a daily basis, but he made sure to get rid of all the WMD?<span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>
<p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>Five hundred shells, with âdegradedâ mustard or sarin nerve agent. <span>  </span>
<span> </span>
<em>Oh, but look!</em>
<em>
<span> </span>Degraded!</em>
<span> </span>Well, yes, they <em>are</em> old.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>But they were <em>kept,</em> too.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>They donât rise to Baathist-FDA standards for quality and effectiveness?<span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Iâm sure Saddam would have fired off a very stern memo about <i>that</i> scandal.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>But it has been <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/005207.php">reported</a> that he made sure that fresher supplies were on hand.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>These of course wouldnât count, because they werenât already mixed together.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Precursors donât count.  <span>...</span>  S<b>

<span> </span>
</span>
<p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>Sarin and mustard gas are not the WMD we were so afraid of?<span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Well,<i> I</i> wasnât afraid at all, so Iâm not sure which âweâ is meant.<span>   </span>
<span> </span>Must be the same âweâ that Bush lied to about there being WMD.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Oh.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>No, must be the same âweâ whose fears Bush played on.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>And it is true that these are not, like, um, James Bond nuclear bombs-n-stuff â¦ giant Soviet-style arsenals with millions of missiles all lined up and pointing at 


Wichita   Falls


.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>I donât suppose Dr.<span>   </span>
<span> </span>No was a Baathist.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>No, these crappy old mustard gas bombs are not impressive at all â like World War One stuff â and hardly anyone died in <i>that</i> war, as I recall.<span>   </span>
<span> </span>Oh.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Well, I might be misremembering myself, but even so, we wanted something that made a <em>big</em> explosion or something.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Not just some sneaky little gas that only kills Kurds.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>
<p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>And after all itâs only 500 shells-n-stuff.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>We went to war over 500 measly shells-n-stuff?<span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>What harm could 500 crappy little shells-er-something do?<span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Ah.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>A math question.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>So letâs look at it.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Letâs extrapolate from one little factoid at my disposal â that Saddam killed five thousand Kurds with two such shells.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Oh.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Well, considering how many people there are in the world, the fact that 500 Baathist WMD shells could kill only one and a quarter million people â thatâs nothing.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Thatâs fewer than the abortionists get in the good olâ 


USA


 every year.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>A drop in the bucket.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>And who would they kill?<span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Just some Jews.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>And of course more Kurds.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Maybe those dirty Iranians.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Hardly any Americans â just the ones who donât belong in 


Iraq


 anyway â the stupid ones, who joined the militaristic military.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Boo!<span> </span>Boo on 


America


 and itâs imperialist militaristic military!<span> </span>Hurrah for Kerry and Gore and, um, Dean and Murtha! And, uh, Hillary?<span>  </span>
<span> </span>- I can't quite tell.<span>   </span>
<span> </span>But hurrah fer them other guys! <p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>Oh, excuse me while I wipe myself off.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>In my enthusiasm I seem to have lost control of my bladder, and I have also inadvertently evacuated various other sacs in my body.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>It must that I love truth so much.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>
<p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>So thatâs one thing.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>The fact that there most certainly were WMD.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>But thatâs not the main things.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>The main thing is that it never was about WMD.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>It was always about the enemy who would use WMD if he had them, and use something else if he didnât.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>We recognize <em>their</em> argument as a typically <em>Liberal</em> one.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Gun control.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>
<i>There are no bad people, only bad weapons.<span>   </span>
<span> </span>
</i>Or something â Iâve never quite followed their reasoning.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>
<i>If Saddam had no weapons of such and such a description, then he could not have been a threat.<span>   </span>
<span> </span>If Americans owned no guns, then violent crime would virtually disappear.<span>   </span>
<span> </span>
</i>Thatâs their logic, insofar as I can puzzle it out.<span>   </span>
<span> </span>
<p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>My logic is that if you get into a fight, you have to win it.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>I donât mean some ridiculous ego-driven shoving match.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>I mean something thatâs real and serious, where the lives of your sons are at stake.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Do not engage, unless youâre there to win.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>And to me, the holiday from history that we luxuriated in during the 


clinton


 years was just an extended Act break in the drama that Bush I co-authored â an over-long intermission in a distant theatre of war.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>It was an oddly attenuated Phony War, where we let the monster gambol across his northern hills, lopping Kurdish heads as a child cuts down dandelions.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>For shame.<span>   </span>
<p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>So the Iraq War was just unfinished business.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>WMD had nothing, nothing to do with the necessity of finishing it.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Terrorism was far more relevant, but even that wasnât quite it.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>



Vietnam


 was more relevant still, with itâs bastard children of 


Lebanon


 and 


Sudan


 â where we cut and ran.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>But even this, for all itâs bad example and invitation to contempt, isnât the real reason.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>The real reason is that if you leave a blood-enemy free, he will find a way to kill you.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Or rather, kill your children. <span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>
<p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>We own guns, if we do, for a reason.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Self-defense.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>We use them against people only to preserve our lives and what is ours.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>But<span> </span>if we have no guns, we will use whatever comes to our hands, to protect ourselves.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Knives and stones and sticks.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>The world is the horror that it is not because of weapons, but people.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Hussein was just such a horrifying person, and to imagine that he would not use his petrowealth for violence, just as he used it for bribes, is irresponsible.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Just as the Islamists attacked the Towers two times, and learned from their mistakes, so did Hussein once hire an attack on the very person of a president.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Would he not try again?<span>  </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>And as he attacked some number of times his neighbors, would he not try again?<span>  </span>
<span> </span>â seeing the cowardice and venality of 
Europe
, and the irresolution of 


America


?<span>  </span>
<p></p>
</p>   <p class="MsoNormal">
<p></p>But perhaps you disagree.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Perhaps youâve never had an enemy.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Maybe youâve never been assaulted.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Your life might have been particularly blessed.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Odd, how our life experiences can lead us in just different directions.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Because I look at the violence of the world, and believe evil people are the cause.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>Others may think it is only a particular type of WMD - of sufficiently recent manufacture, of sufficiently explosive power - that is the great and sole peril.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>I believe this is a view that lacks congruence with reality.<span>   </span>
<span>
<span> </span>
</span>I fear that the only corrective to this failure of insight is that some saddam comes up behind you and stabs you in the back, or hits you on top of your head with a big stone.<span>   </span>
