Now that I've not endorsed a certain kind of endorsement of Lieberman over Lamont, let me criticize the criticism of one of Lieberman's criticisms of Lamont.  The Lieberman camp caused a stir with <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/docs/lieberman-flyer/?resultpage=1&">this flyer</a> distributed at Black churches contending that Lieberman has a much stronger record on race than Lamont.  The flyer plays up Lieberman's support from Bill Clinton and highlights Lieberman's civil rights activism four decades ago, of which the Senator has every right to be proud.  I'd question the invocation of Bill Clinton, who called Sister Souljah a hate-monger and Charles Murray a social scientist, as an authority on the interests of African-Americans.  And I'd say the Lamont campaign is right to point out that it's Lieberman who's flirted with fraying affirmative action.<br /><br />But the centerpiece of the flyer - an indictment of Lamont's membership in an elite country club - strikes me as a fair point (which isn't to say that it should change anyone's vote).  While it's irresponsible to paraphrase Lamont's statement that he didn't consider the lack of diversity of the club as saying that he "didn't pay as much attention to race," and while the details of the club's membership remain hazy, for Lamont to say that he resigned from the club because he didn't want it to "become a distraction" in the Senate race is an uninspiring response at best.<br /><br />Predictably, Lieberman's campaign has been charged with "race-baiting," which is a term which somehow tends to get trotted out with far more frequency in American political discourse to refer to accusations of racism towards Blacks than to refer to appeals to it.  It would of course be specious to call Lamont a racist based on his membership in an elite club, and Lieberman's flyer doesn't do that.  It suggests that Lamont is insensitive to race, and to make that argument, it emphasizes an embarrassing episode for him and makes no mention of the choices he's made that cast him in a far more positive light.  So while I don't agree with the characterization, it's hard for me to take seriously the claims that the evidence offered should be out of bounds.<br /><br />I'm all for voting for politicians based more on their vision on the issues and less on their perceived character.  But to the extent that people care about character - especially in primaries, where in most cases there are less stark differences than the ones we see in Connecticut - I think there are worse things to take into consideration than the organizations in which candidates claim membership.  It's a far more reasonable criticism than, say, GOP accusations that Ted Strickland and his wife are closeted homosexuals.<br /><br />Ned Lamont, of course, has still got my vote.  And I have no doubt that as an advocate for a more just and sane foreign policy, and for a domestic policy which keeps the provision of public support a public responsibility and the devices of private corporations where they belong, he will do far more to protect and advance civil rights in the US Senate over the next six years than Joe Lieberman will.<br /><br /><img src="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/j/msnbc/Components/Photos/060316/060316_nedlamont_hmed9a.hmedium.jpg" />
