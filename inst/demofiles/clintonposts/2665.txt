<p>This is about solving problems in general. James Freed. notably the architect of the Holocaust Museum, died yesterday. He left a legacy of expressing this horrible event in a truly sensitive, nuanced, and iconic manner, a model of both urbanistic and memorial architecture. Yesterday, Sens. Hillary Clinton and Joseph Lieberman held a press conference denouncing violent video games and offering legislation that would tax game creators $1,000. This bully-pulpitism not only doesn't solve the problem of violence in our society, it avoids the entire issue and its most recent demonstration of failure in the conduct and their support of the Iraqi War. </p>

<p>James Freed solved the Holocaust Memorial problem.</p>

<p>Neither Sens. Clinton nor Lieberman have even studied much less offered solutions for the US legacy of domestic and international violence. In considering this statement, please remember Hillary Cliinton's very loud youthful protest against the Vietnam War and for women's rights. Please also remember Joseph Lieberman's religious moral conservative statements about his commitment to Orthodox Judaism and Judaism's legacy of bigotry, discrimination, and violence designed to destroy it. Both of them have forgotten their histories of commitments for peace, first in their both approving the resolution for Presidential war powers in Iraq and, in the case of Sen. Lieberman continuing support of US failed military strategies there. And second, in Sen. Clinton's continued crafting of a "centrist" political position on the withdrawl of troops in Iraq. Their political positions and public moralizing on the giant issue of violence forget that the solutions to these problems start in the nuclear family they talk, moralize, and write about persistently. I believe it was more than 50 years ago Rodgers and Hammersmith wrote a song for the amazing South Pacific whose theme has to do with hate, violence, and bigotry that are taught at home. </p></div>
