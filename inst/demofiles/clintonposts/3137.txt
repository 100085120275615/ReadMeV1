<div>How Hillary should be serving the public after the truth about the frauds she directed to win her Senate seat, and to obstruct the FBI investigation into those frauds, is exposed to the world!<br />Hillary told the Washington Post on August 15, 2000, three months before her election to the Senate, that she "vowed" not to accept any contributions from Hollywood internet mogul, and convicted felon, Peter Paul.<br />On August 17, 2000, Hillary repeated she HAD not accepted any contributions from Paul, except for $2000 discovered by the Post, which Hillary announced she was promptly refunding to Paul.<br />
