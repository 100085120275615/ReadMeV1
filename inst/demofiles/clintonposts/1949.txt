<a href="http://www.ithacacarshare.org">Car Share</a> is a plan that needs to come to Ithaca...NOW. I need it now. I want it now. Before my inspection runs out in February and I have to replace my damn gas tank that is going to cost me more than what I spent to buy the car. I am so sick and tired of paying for a car that I literally drive to the store because I'm too lazy to take the bus. I live three blocks from where I work and other than the awful hill I have to walk up, I have no excuse. I pay for parking where I live! I pay for my car to sit all day. It's disgusting.</span>

<br />
<span>On <span>Thursday January 26, 2006 from 11am - 4pm</span> there will be a summit on Car Share programs from other cities. The program will be in the Borg Warner Room of the Tompkins County Library.</span>
