<div>Dear Friends,<br />
<br />I wanted to write you with a quick update on the vote to override President Bush's veto of the stem cell research bill.<br />
<br />Unfortunately, last night the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives pushed a very quick vote on the override. Their strategy was to hold a vote before the public -- which has consistently supported stem cell research by huge margins -- could weigh in. While a large majority voted to overturn President Bush's veto in a 235 to 193 vote, they fell short of the two-thirds majority required.<br />
<br />So President Bush's veto will stand, keeping huge obstacles in the way of future stem cell research.<br />
<br />Make no mistake: this fight is far from over. Hillary, who co-sponsored the bill passed by Congress, will continue to speak out on this issue and make it a top priority. We must keep fighting for additional funding for stem cell research and eliminate the arbitrary restrictions President Bush has put on the scientists who are pursuing tomorrow's cures.<br />
<br />We must also intensify our efforts to elect as many Democrats as we can to the House and Senate this November. Across the country, Democratic candidates are speaking out about this issue, making it a top priority in the 2006 elections. When we have Democratic majorities in the House and Senate, you can bet we'll pass this legislation again.<br />
<br />We've updated our online action. You can still show your support for this vital research that holds so much potential for so many families. I urge you to sign on in support of stem cell research and to tell your friends and family to join you.<br />
