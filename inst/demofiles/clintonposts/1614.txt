<h4><center>Wal-Mart vs. welfare</center></h4>
<p>Foreign policy isnÂt the only arena where Democrats have abandoned their own principles and disavowed their own previously staked-out positions, as today's <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082700553.html">op-ed columnist Sebastian Mallaby</a> points out. A decade ago Hillary Clinton sat on Wal-MartÂs board. Last yearÂheeding the call from  labor unions over her old Arkansas neighborsÂshe returned a campaign contribution from the mega-retailer. But before Democrats on the summer campaign trail join too many anti-Wal-Mart rallies, they should take a look at a recent independent paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research. It shows that big-box stores led by Wal-Mart reduce families' food bills by one-fourth. Because Wal-Mart's price-cutting also affects the non-food stuff it sells, it saves U.S. consumers upward of $200 billion a year, making it a larger booster of family welfare than the federal government's $33 billion food-stamp program.</p>
