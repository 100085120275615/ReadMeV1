<p>Lyra's back there coloring, and Ben's up front, chewing on one of Hillary's <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/pointykitty.html">Pointy Kitties</a> that I made out of an old sheet. There are Michael's third-hand golf clubs in the corner (he's met his breaking-100 goal for the year). The mantel, the table and the sideboard are, as always, cluttered with stuff that doesn't really go anywhere else yet since it's mostly just found its way into the house or is on its way out or else its being kept nearby to ward off tantrums or boredom or something. I can clean it all up, but it'll just come back. Urgh.</p>

<p>Oh and hey, there's my new couch! Michael gave it to me for my birthday (and Christmas and Mother's Day and Labor Day and New Year's and every other 2006 holiday). Anybody can sit on it, but it's mine. It's actually new (we've never had a real, new couch before), and it's got plenty of stuffing, so that you feel as though you're sitting on something solid instead of something mushy. It even offers back support so that you don't walk funny after an hour of say, sitting and knitting on the couch. It's a miracle of couchness, I tell you. I adore it.<br /></p></div>
