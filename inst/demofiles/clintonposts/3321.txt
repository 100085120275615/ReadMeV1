<div>It's been awhile since BT looked at poll numbers and with President Bush's approval numbers dipping into the <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/BushJob.htm">mid 30s</a>, we thought it would be interesting to check in over at <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/">Polling Report.com</a>. Hillary Clinton is the runaway <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/2008.htm">favorite</a> for the Democratic nomination, with over 40% at this point, and it's looking like Rudy Giuliani and John McCain are leading the GOP pack. No one likes Bill Frist or Newt Gingrich. Be sure and notice that when asked if there was any in the field of Democrats whom they would not vote for (sort of an unfavorable rating), John Edwards had the lowest number. Edwards just barely leads Gore and Kerry on the preference meter with 14%, still a distant second to Hillary's 41%. Most noteworthy of all of these contenders is Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice (who told Tim Russert a few months back that she would not run for president), outpolling Giuliani and McCain while having a personal favorability <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/P-Z.htm">rating</a> hovering in the neighborhood of 60%.<br />
<br />Here's yet another way to elect the first woman president:  don't run any men.</div>
