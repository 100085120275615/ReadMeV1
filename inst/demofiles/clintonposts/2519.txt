<div>(Part I of a series)<br />
<br />As I wrote a few days ago at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/7/1/19720/57195">http://www.dailykos.com/...</a> , I've begun to interview a series of young candidates running for office. I want to thank those of you who offered suggestions, and I'm sorry I wasn't able to respond on time (family stuff, y'know?). Anyway, on to the first interview!<br />Andrew Rice is a 33-year old Oklahoman who is running for the State Senate. When I first read about him, I was amazed. Andrews has led a life full of remarkable service to this world, from helping AIDS victims in Thailand to beocming an activist for progressive values (in Oklahoma, no less!) to his expertise on religious issues that allows him to combat the growing trend of fundamentalist extremism in our country. Plus, he's a Kossack! His website is <a href="http://www.andrewforoklahoma.com/">http://www.andrewforoklahoma.com</a> , and I urge you all to read more about him.<br />
<br />I sent a list of questions to Andrew earlier today, and he was impressive in his responses. You can read them for yourselves here:<br />1.Tell us where you're from, and what your background is. Did your background influence your plans to run for office?<br />Andrew: I was born in Oklahoma City and grew up here. I went to college in Maine and grad school in Boston, and then lived in the northeast until moving back home to Oklahoma City in 2003 (via 1 Â½ years in Austin, TX). I was not raised in a political home. My parents were moderate Republicans who never spoke about politics. All the children in my family were encouraged to attend college out of state so we could be exposed to multiculturalism and the rest of the world. Interestingly, all of us ended up becoming progressive Democrats because of this and because of the progressive values my parents instilled in us, even though they were for the most part unaware that the values they raised us with were more progressive than conservative. My background did influence by decision to run in that I was raised with a deep respect for what I call "community-based self interest", that my well-being is connected to the well-being and vitality of the larger community I live in. My parents did not want us growing up feeling we could isolate ourselves away from the world at large.<br />2.When and how did you first get involved in politics? Who inspired you to get involved, and how was he/she an influence?<br />Andrew: I first became in involved in politics through activism in college. I was very active in a group that was concerned with financial aid issues at our college, which was Colby College in Maine. I was not on aid, but had several good friends who were. There was a sense that the school did not fully appreciate the demands put on lower-income students, many of whom were sending a lot of their work-study income home to their families to help pay the bills. The majority of the student body was affluent, and we felt the administration needed to become more sensitive to the difficulties for lower-income students in an elitist environment. I also was involved in campus activism around the assassination of the Israel Prime Minister Rabin and the Rwandan Genocide. I was in college during the Clinton years, so there was some apathy that came with the prosperity and peace time.<br />In grad school at Harvard I was involved in a living wage campaign for the cafeteria and part-time custodial staff. Throughout these years however, I was not involved in electoral politics at all, just progressive activism.<br />
<br />3.What led you to decide to run for office?<br />Andrew: My decision to run was very personal. I left grad school and made a documentary and moved to New York to work on documentaries. My sister Amy already lived there, and about a year after I moved there my older brother David moved there from Chicago. David was transferred there by his investment firm and they had an office in the World Trade Center. He was killed on Sept. 11th, he worked in the North Tower. After about a month, I realized that we were in for a very unsettling period in our country because of the attacks and the Bush administration's initial response to them. I knew that despite the initial unity, that we were headed toward becoming a deeply divided country and we would be tempted as a country to against some of our most basic and important democratic principles.<br />I became very involved in a September 11th family group called Peaceful Tomorrows. Our larger mission was to try and have a voice for an authentic dialogue about how we can best combat terrorism over the long term, and not just give into our most reactionary impulses. We really became mobilized when it became apparent that the Bush administration was determined to invade Iraq and use 9/11 as a justification. I began traveling to DC to speak with members of congress and think tank analysts and it was clear that Iraq was unrelated to 9/11 and that this was a major exploitation of a very personal loss for me. I became more and more political around post-9/11 issues of concern to me: the 9/11 Commission, the Patriot Act, Bush's exploitation of 9/11 in his re-election campaign. I found myself being pulled deeper and deeper into electoral politics and the legislative process, and away from advocacy work, because I kept experiencing first-hand the power of government and the limited power (especially in a post-9/11 world) of advocating from the outside.<br />I essentially decided to run so I could cease having to keep knocking on representative's doors from the outside, and instead have a seat at the table on the inside, and have the power to take bold stands for the progressive values this country needs, and on which this country was founded.<br />
<br />4.Describe the type of office you are seeking, and how that office affects the people around it. (Ex: US Senator serves entire state, votes on federal issues etc.)<br />Andrew: I'm running for State Senate (District 46) in urban Oklahoma City. It is a relatively progressive and populist district, and therefore a unique one in very "Red" Oklahoma. It is funny, over the last 8 months I have knocked doors in every precinct in this district and people either want to talk about federal issues or very local issues like their trash being picked up; very rarely do people want to talk about state government. However, State government has an enormous impact in Oklahomans' lives: tuition increases, tax-cuts that impact state services, etc...<br />The gist of my platform is that I will take political risks for the good of this district and the state. It is the anti-"overly cautious" politician campaign. From time to time the best legislative decision is also the most politically "risky" according to the conventional wisdom of the day. What I find is that voters are apathetic because there are so few authentic leaders who will demonstrate that they care more about good government than playing it safe and their next election. People want something different and it cannot be easily classified as either conservative or liberal, they want public servants who will level with them and respectfully challenge the widely held perceptions that are getting us nowhere in this country.<br />This seat has grown accustomed to progressive and very independent-minded leadership for several decades. It is a good fit for the type of candidate I am.<br />
<br />5.How have party leaders viewed your candidacy? Did your age play a role in this?<br />Andrew: I think there was hesitation early on among Party leaders. Oklahoma is a red state where many Democrats running for office run very fast away from the "liberal" label and too often don't take stands even on issues where the public is with them. Given my very public background against the war and that, among other things, I was awarded the local ACLU civil libertarian award, I think some party leaders were scared I was going to be "bad" for the state party. But I have worked hard and gotten great momentum, and I have shown that my aggressive campaign approach is really about showing people where you stand and being proud of your convictions. Most voters respect your convictions and disrespect someone who is trying to see which way the wind is blowing and plays it safe. I understand and accept that we have more conservative Democrats and districts in our state than the district I am running for. I just ask that Democratic politicians here find their core set of principles and don't compromise them.<br />My contention is that Oklahoma voters are not accustomed to having Democratic candidates respectfully challenge the ridiculous right-wing talking points here, and when we do challenge them, we win votes. I have not had one voter tell me on their doorstep that they are for the massive tax-cuts being approved on a national level and state level after we talk about the devastating effects they are having on our economy. When they realize that these tax-cuts are shrinking government down to the size to where Grover Norquist and these radicals can drown it in a bathtub, and what that means for their aunt with no healthcare, or for their children's public school or the road in front of their house, they are with us, not the Republicans. The more we get out their and speak passionately with them about their concerns and real-life problems and show them that the progressive platform will do something about it, then we can win. I spoke with working class Republican woman yesterday who is on assistance from the state. One of the Republicans running in the other primary put a sign in her yard. I was asking her about what she thought about him. She said she did not know much about him and was confused about him wanting to do away with something called the "death tax". We talked about what the "death tax" really was and about what the Republican party stands for, and that if conservatives had their way, government assistance would be eliminated. She had never been confronted about these things. So we need a respectful, but aggressive local Democratic party and candidates who take these issues head on.<br />My age has not been a concern. Oklahoma is a state where someone like David Boren was elected governor at an age younger than me. People here are comfortable with young politicians. I am 33, which is the age Brad Carson was in 2000 when he was first elected to Congress from eastern Oklahoma.<br />
<br />6.What issues are you concentrating on the most in your campaign? Why? And have those issues resonated with voters?<br />Andrew: See the answer to question #4.<br />
<br />7.Has your age been an issue with voters? If possible, describe some episode where your age either helped or hurt you while campaigning.<br />Andrew: If anything, my age has helped me with voters. Many people feel like too many politicians stay too long in public service. We have legislative term-limits in Oklahoma now, and that is how this Senate seat has opened up. Most voters say they are ready for "new blood".<br />
<br />8.If (re)elected, what are your top 3 priorities?<br />
<br />Andrew: 1.Fiscal Responsibility (i.e. adequate funding of State Programs and investments in our infrastructure has to take place before any talk of tax-cuts)<br />2.Standing up for the Separation of Church and State and therefore the religious freedoms that ensures all Oklahomans can keep government out of their religion, and vice versa.<br />3.Complete transparency and accountability. I will offer myself up to the highest levels of constituent accountability and government transparency.<br />
<br />9.How is your opponent campaigning? Do you feel as if your age influences his/her strategy?<br />Andrew: My age is not an issue. I have a big primary in 3 weeks (July 25th). I have 2 Democratic opponents: a woman who is a recent law school grad and a guy who works at the local Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber guy is being bankrolled by big Republican money because this seat is seen as a safe Democratic seat. The Democratic primary winner is considered the clear favorite in the general election. So the local Republican funders would like him in there to advance their agenda that is anti-labor and pro-tax cuts. We expect him to come after me and smear me for being progressive in hopes of scaring Democratic voters that only a conservative, DINO can win the general election. It is funny though, John Kerry did not win one county in Oklahoma in 2004, but he won a majority of these State Senate precincts. This is a progressive seat for Oklahoma and actually a DINO is exactly the type of Democratic candidate who could lose the seat to a moderate Republican. There are 2 Republicans running in the other primary: one is your typical religious right candidate, the other is a bit more moderate.<br />It has not become a nasty Democratic primary yet, but it could become one in the next 3 weeks.<br />
<br />10.What advice would you give to future candidates who would like to run for office as a young person? (Like me, for example!) Andrew: My only advice is this: make sure you are thick-skinned, and be very clear with yourself about what you are willing to compromise and what are your are not willing to compromise. The voters respect someone who shoots it straight with them and is equally respectful of their beliefs. Local, retail politics races are where we as progressive democrats should be running in. You have the power to go out and meet each voter and have control over your image, unlike the larger races that are fought out on TV and Radio with smears. Local races are where we will build the farm team of the new progressive movement.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />I learned a lot, actually, from Andrew's responses. The main message I got from them is this: that if you stand up for what you believe in and campaign with ideas and integrity, then age should not be an issue at all. I'll have to see if that is true with my future interviews as well; for now, I want to thank Andrew for answering my questions in such a timely fashion. His primary, as he said is on July 27th, so if you want to help him out now would be the time to do it!<br />My next interview will be published later this week.</div>
