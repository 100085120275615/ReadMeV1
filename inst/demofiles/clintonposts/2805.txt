<div><p>The freakshows otherwise <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB115647084102945206.html?mod=hps_us_pageone">known as astrologers</a> are concerned about Pluto's demotion:</p>

<blockquote>"Scorpios can be extremely explosive, and very direct, and this could be the trigger that makes them explode," says Milton Black, an Australian astrologer who claims to have more than 580,000 clients. Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, take note. All three are Scorpios.

<p>How a group of astronomers decided that diorama you built in grade school has one too many planets.</p>

<p>Yesterday's ruling in Prague brought good news to some. The astronomers indicated that several planet-like bodies -- including the asteroid Ceres and the newly discovered UB313, sometimes known as Xena -- will also be classified as dwarf planets. That has generated excitement among a small group of practitioners known as "minor-planet astrologers" who have long contended that outer-lying asteroids and ice balls exert a powerful tug on our psychological makeup. Some astrologers believe that officially introducing new dwarf planets to the charts might give astrologers additional information about people, by providing more planetary bodies and forces to study in the charts.</p>

<p>"This is a moment that I've been waiting for a long time," says Eric Francis, a minor-planet astrologer who edits the Web site Planetwaves.net. "People are finally talking about Charon." Charon is Pluto's largest moon, which astronomers briefly considered granting official planet status at the IAU meeting.</p>

<p>Mr. Francis and many other minor-planet enthusiasts are interested in raising awareness about Charon and the new dwarf planets, Ceres and UB313, in part because they consider them female planets that would symbolize a rush of new maternal energy into the cosmos.</p>

<p>"Most of our clients are women, and we need stories women can relate to," says Mr. Francis. (A planet's sex is determined largely by the name given to it by astronomers.)</blockquote></p>

<p>Kill religion.  Elevate man.</p>

<p>That this shit should appear on the front page of the Wall St. Journal beggars belief.</p>

<p>By the way, are women really as weak as "most of our client are women, and we need stories women cna relate to" implies?  If so, they should no longer have the right to vote or to drive, or to do anything which qualifies them as "human" for those beasts for whom astrology is a reliable guide are not man at all but fool.</p></div>
