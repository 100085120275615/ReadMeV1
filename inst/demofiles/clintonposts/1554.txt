<div align="left"><span>So I am on the</span><a href="http://www.yahoo.com/"><span> Yahoo homepage</span></a><span> and I notice a flashing picture of Hillary Clinton and next to it is "Yahoo Health" and "Blog For Hope" -- intrigued as I was -- I proceeded. What is this? You may ask -- they </span><a href="http://blogs.health.yahoo.com/blog-for-hope"><span>explain</span></a><span>....</span></div><blockquote><p><em><span></span></em> </p><p><em><span>In a 30-day Blog for Hope event on Yahoo! Health, celebrities from every walk of public life will share the triumphs, insights, and personal stories of how cancer has affected their lives. </span></em><br /></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>So now, I am VERY interested in reading Mrs. Clinton's triumphs, insights, and person story of how cancer has affected HER life.... and please note that she is under the title "health expert" lol .... so </span><a href="http://blogs.health.yahoo.com/blog-for-hope/clinton/11/we-cannot-afford-breast-cancer"><span>here</span></a><span><span> it is...</span> </span></p><blockquote><div dir="ltr"><span><strong><em>We Cannot Afford Breast Cancer</em></strong></span></div><p class="entryheading" dir="ltr"><span><em><span>posted by </span></em><a href="http://blogs.health.yahoo.com/blog-for-hope/clinton/"><em><span>Senator Hillary Clinton</span></em></span></a><em><span> <span class="date">Sun, Aug 14, 2005, 6:49 pm PDT </span></span></em><a class="comment" href="http://blogs.health.yahoo.com/blog-for-hope/clinton/11/we-cannot-afford-breast-cancer#comment"><em><span>Post a Comment</span></em></a><em><span> </span></em></p><p class="entrycontent" dir="ltr"><em><span>The recent declines in death rates from breast cancer show that with research, early detection, prevention, and quality care, we can make progress, and the sobering statistics show why we must. Nearly 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime, and over 40,000 women will die this year from breast cancer alone. We cannot afford to continue losing our mothers, sisters, and loved ones to this disease. I support breast cancer research to help us find the causes and find the cure for breast cancer, because as Mary Lasker, one of the strongest research champions once said, "if you think research is expensive -- try disease." </span></em></p></blockquote><div class="entrycontent" dir="ltr"><span><strong>Wow, I am so amazed and inspired by her story of triumph. Moved by her incredible insights, and after reading the above, I had NO idea of just how much this has affected her personal life.</strong></span></div><br /><div class="entrycontent" dir="ltr"> </div><div class="entrycontent" dir="ltr" align="left"><span></span></div><div class="entrycontent" dir="ltr" align="left"><span></span> </div><div class="entrycontent" dir="ltr" align="left"><span>Thank you, Hillary -- for again reaffirming what a fake, politically motivated, ego-centric person that you are. I would have had more respect if you couldn't offer anything to this topic - shutting up. But to take the opportunity just to have your mug plastered on Yahoo, and then insulting the intelligence of anyone that was seriously needing support is..... well..... just so liberal of you.</span></div><div class="entrycontent" dir="ltr" align="left"><span></span></div><div class="entrycontent" dir="ltr" align="left"><span><strong>...Why don't you just stick to the topic of infidelity and continue to give young women the message that you know best "Standing By Your Man"....</strong></span></div><p></p>
