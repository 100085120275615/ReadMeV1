<div>I have given this a lot of thought and the only way to combat these moronic political activists who live in lala land and an alternative reality I feel is to sue them.<br />
<br />  I propose a lawsuit that names the following as coconspirators of terrorism. That their actions and beliefs are harmful to me and my families safety. That knowingly they are putting me at risk.<br />
<br />  I want to sue the folowing:<br />
<br />         The ACLU (American communist liberation unit) for protecting and harboring murderers.<br />         U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor in Detroit for aidding and abeding terrorist.<br />         Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosei, Ted Kennedy, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, and John Murtha for failing to do their sworn jobs of protecting me from terrorism.<br />         George Sorros for knowingly financing those who aid terrorists.<br />         CAIR for knowingly protecting and harboring, financing and suppling terrorism as well as hate speach under the hate speach laws.<br />
<br />  This is just a start there are more who need a dose of reality and to be sued. Is there a laywer out there who isnt under the influence of the left willing to do this? Doubtful.</div>
