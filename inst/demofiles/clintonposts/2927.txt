<br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br />
<br />NY TIMES CALLS FOR CLINTON TO DEBATE TASINI<br />
<br />NEW YORK, NY - Jonathan Tasini, Democratic Senate candidate in New York, today released the following statement on The New York Times editorial (see below) which called on Hillary Clinton to agree to debate Tasini. The New York Times joins The New York Post, The Albany Times Union and Newsday in calling for a debate in the primary:"Voices from across the spectrum are calling on Hillary Clinton to stop hiding behind her political machine and come out and debate the issues. Voters in New York have many questions of the incumbent and they deserve to have answers before they cast a vote on September 12th. Voters want to know who would best represent them on matters of security, the economy and civil rights.<br />
<br />I am ready to debate my opponent any time and any place and as many times as we can agree on from now through September 12th. The Republicans have debated, the Democrats in the governor's and attorney general's race have debated. What is my opponent afraid of?"New York Times EditorialMonday, August 21, 2006Hillary Clintonâs Low Profile With only a few weeks until New Yorkâs Sept. 12 primary elections, many people are probably still unaware that Senator Hillary Clinton is facing a challenge for the Democratic nomination. Her opponent, Jonathan Tasini, is low on almost everything, from funds to name recognition.<br />
<br />Mrs. Clinton has successfully ignored Mr. Tasini all summer, and now it seems clear that she has no intention of responding to his demands that she meet him in a debate. She should change her mind. In a year when New York has very few competitive elections, voters are going to get very little chance to hear serious discussions from the candidates.<br />
<br />Since Mr. Tasini is running an antiwar campaign, it would be very useful for New Yorkers to have a chance to hear the two Democratic candidates debate that one issue. New York voters have been exposed to all the political drama in Connecticut over Senator Joseph Lieberman, who like Mrs. Clinton supported the invasion of Iraq. She has been far more critical of the Bush administrationâs handling of the war â a point the Clinton campaign makes pains to point out.<br />
<br />But she has not been forced to discuss in great detail exactly what she thinks should be done now that things have gone so far awry in the Middle East. Presuming she wins the primary, Mrs. Clinton will go up against a weak Republican candidate this fall. Anything can happen in an election, but there is a very good chance she could coast all the way to November without being tested on any important issue. Right now is a good time to make sure that does not happen.<br />
