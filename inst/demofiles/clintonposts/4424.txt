<p>By design, computers make terrific electo-static air filters.  With cooling fans drawing cool air over metal heat sinks a weak electro magnetic charge is created.  Airborne particulate matter is attracted to the metallic heat sinks on the cpu much like the air-filters one sees constantly advertised on television.  Over time debris will build up on the aluminum fins and will restrict airflow and cause the operating temperature of the processor to increase progressively leading to over-heating issues which could eventually cause total system failure if a destructive heat threshold is consistently surpassed and ignored.  This very situation led to the loss of a two page Lamont/Lieberman post I had written earlier today.  You would think that having my computer desk next to a breezeway where we keep two cat litter boxes would prompt me to be a little more vigilant when it comes to maintenance but, well, as the Tralvamadorians say &#8220;so it goes.&#8221;Â  In its stead, here is a truncated version of the post:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/posts/2006/08/09/horowitz-blames-the-shadow-party-for-liebermans-defeat/">Mouth-Breathing</a> <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/posts/2006/08/09/limbaugh-on-lieberman-one-of-the-factors-in-his-defeat-was-the-fact-that-hes-just-jewish/">Right</a> got a lot of mileage during the nineties over Hillary Clinton&#8217;s, mention of a &#8220;vast right-wing conspiracy&#8221; aimed at her husband Bill.</li>
<li>ironically, those on the right are the most feverish conspiracy theorists among us (eg-UN black helicopters, fifth column academics, opportunistic meteorologists, etc)</li>
<li>the contempt for democracy on the right is so deep that they resort to the above rationalizations to explain away why people don&#8217;t vote consistently with their issues despite the reality that the bugaboos they frequently invoke are completely hypocritical (Richard Melon Scaife is the light-bearer of truth while George Soros an insidious, propagandizing charlatan)</li>
<li>In a classic fit of projection the Right demonstates how they simply cannot accept an action contrary to their own beliefs.Â  They either characterize the event in terms of greed and self-interest or pretend that they themselves aren&#8217;t hopeless cynics and explain away such incidences as moments when the public are simply duped.</li>
</ul>
<p>-That about sums it up.Â  I also wanted to mention that the lack of posting lately can be blamed on a spat of ill health I&#8217;ve suffered.Â  The good news is that I&#8217;m not dying.Â  My heart echo test came back fine.Â  Turns out I just have an ulcer from watching Fox News.</p>
