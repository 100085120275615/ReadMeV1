<p>While on the road yesterday, I heard the same description of yesterday's and Sunday's marches echoed over and over on the radio: all American flags, no sign of the Mexican or other foreign flags from before, quote from illegal alien protestor: "It's the new civil rights movement, we just want to be American!"</p>

<p>Needless to say, it's <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004962.htm" target="blank">not true</a>.</p>

<p>And is anyone really surprised?  I certainly hope not.  The media is once again acting as the megaphone for congressional Democrats, who are busily redefining disingenuiousness with a full-scale reversal on positions they held not so long ago on the illegal immigration issue.  Hannity and Levin both played clips of Hillary's little rant yesterday in New York, about how the lawbreakers standing before her were the ones who "care for our children, clean our toilets, serve our food," etc., followed by a clip from her on a radio show less than a year ago stating that it was important to crack down both on illegal immigrants and their employers.  Today, however, she calls a bill that does just that "not in touch with reality."  If that's not the definition of a flip-flop, then I don't know what would be.  </p>

<p>Even worse, some Republican leaders are going along with this nonsense.  Bill Frist, supposedly one of the frontrunners for the Republican nomination for president, ought to think twice after endorsing the ridiculous amnesty bill that, thankfully, failed miserably when brought to a vote.  Tom Tancredo, Jeff Sessions, and Texas' own John Cornyn and Kay Bailey Hutchison have stood firm on this issue, thankfully.  </p>

<p>Thomas Sowell takes a look at some of the "solutions" offered and <a href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/columns/thomassowell/2006/04/11/193239.html" target="blank">points out</a> why illegal aliens are as big a problem as they're being portrayed:</p>

<blockquote>Some free-market advocates argue that the same principle which justifies free international trade in commodities should justify the free movement of people as well. But this ignores the fact that people have consequences that go far beyond the consequences of commodities.

<p>Commodities are used up and vanish. People generate more people, who become a permanent and expanding part of the country's population and electorate.</p>

<p>It is an irreversible process -- and a potentially dangerous process, as Europeans have discovered with their "guest worker" programs that have brought in many Muslims who are fundamentally hostile to the culture and the people that welcomed them.</p>

<p>Unlike commodities, people in a welfare state have legal claims on other people's tax dollars and expensive services in schools and hospitals, not to mention the high cost of imprisoning many of them who commit crimes.</p>

<p>Immigrants in past centuries came here to become Americans, not to remain foreigners, much less to proclaim the rights of their homelands to reclaim American soil, as some of the Mexican activist groups have done.</p>

<p>In the wars that this country fought, immigrant groups were among the most patriotic volunteers, earning the respect of American citizens on the battlefield with their blood and their lives.</p>

<p>Today, immigrant spokesmen promote grievances, not gratitude, much less patriotism. Moreover, many native-born Americans also promote a sense of separatism and grievance and, through "multi-culturalism," strive to keep immigrants foreign and disaffected. </blockquote></p>

<p>And what of the illegals themselves?  The Hispanic supremacy organization La Raza (and don't be fooled, that's exactly what they are) are busily proclaiming everyone who wishes to defend this country from invasion "racist," while at the same time supporting the notion that the southwest US is rightfully Mexico.  The media is full of clips of illegal alien protestors saying that "they just want to be American," but I suspect that it's merely an attempt to recover from the PR blow they took for the much more blatantly anti-American protests of last week.  Need more evidence?  This week's protests were organized by the very much anti-American, Workers' World Party-front group <a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20060404-122847-7263r.htm" target="blank">International ANSWER</a>.  </p>

<p>Any Republican leader that supports amnesty or anything less than punishment of those who hire illegals and deportation of those who break into our country ought to be ashamed of themselves, and ought to look forward to election issues later this year.  Someone ought to be archiving every word spoken by anyone who's stood up for the "civil rights" of these lawbreakers, so Americans can be reminded exactly who supports the defense of this country and who was willing to sell citizenship for votes.</p>
