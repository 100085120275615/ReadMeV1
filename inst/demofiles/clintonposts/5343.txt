Horatio Alger is dead, and I have <a href="http://socialjusticeblog.blogspot.com/2006/01/horatio-alger-is-dead.html">argued</a> that his dream (fantasy?) also died long ago.  Some of you may have noticed Hillary Rodham Clinton's newest project in the news lately: <a href="http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?contentid=253992&kaid=137&subid=900111">The American Dream Initiative</a> with the <a href="http://www.dlc.org">Democratic Leadership Council</a>.  <br /><br />This is further evidence that it is finally becoming painfully obvious that the American Dream just doesn't exist.  For one, evidence suggests that social mobility is a massive exaggeration in this country.  For another, what happened to the benefits?  Getting to the middle class just isn't the same anymore.  Middle class families are faced with dual-income pressures like never before, as well as pressures to buy houses in areas with excellent schools, and a myriad of other expenses once never even considered (for instance, see Elizabeth Warren's discussion in <em>The Two Income Trap</em> and Juliet B. Schor's <em>Overspent American</em>).  Needless to say, during this same period we are working longer hours, earning stagnant wages, and finding that our money buys less and less when everything from gasoline to health care to college just continues to take a bigger chunk out of our pay checks (for example, see Juliet B. Schor's earlier book, <em>The Overworked American</em> and Teresa Sullivan's <em>The Fragile Middle Class</em>).  <br /><br />Let us also not forget the psychological problems that result from these pressures, decreased purchasing power of our middle class dollars, etc.  Indeed, reports on the middle class psyche continue to indicate that it is not a secure place to be in society.  This supposedly "core" aspect of our culture is always wanting more and always worried about ending up with less (Barbara Ehrenreich's <em>Fear of Falling</em> is a good place to start on that second point).<br /><br />So with the American Dream Initiative, too little too late is nonetheless a welcome addition to a country in denial.  I am somewhat bothered by the clear emphasis on college.  By pushing college as the paith to the middle class lifestyle, the Initiative seems be avoiding the true problem.  The true problem is that the middle class today just isn't a great place to be.  Some of it is monetary; some of it is psychological.  But to emphasize college loses sight of reality--a college degree just doesn't really matter anymore.  To use an image from Schor, standing up in a crowd doesn't provide a better view once everyone stands up (the Initiative seeks an America where as many people go to college as possible).  For many, many people, college is a waste of money.  I'm not saying people shouldn't go to college, but we have to remember to work on what happens when they get out.<br /><br />The other pillars?  1) save for retirement, 2) workers equipped with the tools of management (yikes, talk about an uneasy managerial class! 3) build wealth and own a home, and 4) afford health insurance.  I commend the initiative for raising problems up to a more visible place in American politics, but honestly believe this is a very effective game plan.  The main problem, however, rests in what happens between the ears of many Americans: trying to get ahead is not the answer to any problem any working American faces.  More on this another time....
