<div><p>A true Eureka! moment for Congressman <strong>Bill Delahunt</strong> when he parachuted in last week to chat with the locals in Eastham, as described by <strong>Doreen Leggett</strong> in <a href="http://www2.townonline.com/brewster/localRegional/view.bg?articleid=226595&format=&page=1">The Cape Codder</a>.<br />"Russ French questioned how Delahunt could be interested in health care and energy policy, and be against Cape Wind Associates' plans to build a wind farm in Nantucket Sound," Leggett wrote.<br />"Delahunt replied that before wind farms are built there needs to be an overarching policy in place, and he has filed a bill that aims to authorize zoning in coastal waters.<br />"What would have a bigger impact on decreasing reliance on foreign oil, he said, was increasing the fuel efficiency of cars from 25 to 45 miles per gallon.<br />"Then we are independent. It's that simple," Delahunt claimed. "In the end the answer is the automobile."<br />This is where I slap hand to forehead and exclaim - geez, it was right there in front of us all along! And it's all so <em>simple</em> - all we have to do is nearly double fuel-efficiency in our vehicles.<br />Why hadn't anyone thought of this before? (well, actually ...)<br />There are, however, more than a few problems with Delahunt's formulation.</p><p>For example, if it were all so simple, we would have done this decades ago.<br />The fact that half the vehicles on the roads are SUVs shows the limited market appeal of fuel-efficient vehicles, unless gas prices go much higher.<br />Consider also that most vehicles built in this country come out of Michigan, a crucial battleground state in every presidential election (and presidential campaigns are now endless affairs, with candidates like <strong>Hillary Clinton </strong>functioning like governments in exile).<br />The district represented by Delahunt, incidentally, has not a single auto manufacturer, so he can weigh in on this without little fear of challenge at public forums on the Cape. <br />Has it ever occurred to Delahunt that there may be a trade-off of lives for fuel-efficiency when you strip down vehicles to get to that vaunted 45 miles per gallon?<br />And mandating more miles to the gallon for cars does absolutely nothing to stop emissions from spewing out of the stacks of fossil-fuel burning plants, emissions that are killing people across the country - every day. And who are these people, incidentally? Infants, pregnant women, children with asthma, white-haired grandparents hobbled by age, the veteran who took a bullet in the lung and still has trouble breathing. In other words, those most vulnerable among us - a constituency that used to matter to Democrats like Delahunt.<br />Just out of curiosity, does the vehicle Delahunt drives, or is driven in, get anywhere near 45 miles per gallon? I seriously doubt it. I'd wager it is closer to half that (and I drive a Toyota Echo, all 38 miles a gallon of it and not much protection, in case you're wondering)</p></div>
