Rally</a><blockquote>Senator Clinton, addressing a crowd of several thousand people, said the United States must show <span>âsolidarity and supportâ for Israel in the face of the âunwarranted, unprovokedâ seizure of three Israeli soldiers by members of Hamas and Hezbollah, which she referred to as among âthe new totalitarians of the 21st century.â</span><br /><br /><span>âWe will stand with Israel because Israel is standing for American values as well as Israeli ones,â </span>said Mrs. Clinton, who was joined by two dozen political and religious leaders on a stage along 42nd Street.<br /><br />Mrs. Clinton, who is seeking re-election to the Senate and is considered a possible candidate for president in 2008, also compared Israelâs fierce response, which has included heavy bombardment of Lebanon, to a theoretical response by the United States if it faced attacks from neighboring countries.<br /><span>âI want us here in New York to imagine, if extremist terrorists were launching rocket attacks across the Mexican or Canadian border, would we stand by or would we defend America against these attacks from extremists?â Mrs. Clinton said to roars of approval.<br /><br />âWe will support her efforts to send a message to Hamas, Hezbollah, to the Syrians, to the Iranians,â</span> Mrs. Clinton said. âWe will not permit this to happen and we will take whatever steps are necessary.â<br /><br /><span>âIt is a message that we want not only those in the Middle East to hear, but the world, because no nation is safe from these terrorist extremists,â</span> she said. â<span>They do not believe in human rights, they do not believe in democracy. They are totalitarians, they are the new totalitarians of the 21st century.â</span></blockquote>Was there, have alot to say, but must catch up on work, but will post more later.<br />Suffice to say that when it comes to Senator Clinton, it was comforting to see that so many thousands of people appreciated what she had to say. A big contrast to past rallies where she was booed for no reason. Senator Clinton has proven herself to be a great friend of Israel with a perfect record. She spoke about the Israelis obligation to fight back against terrorism. There was one woman near where I stood, who began to scream boos the moment she was called up. This woman was the only booer, and in a sea of jews of all types (and other people) they were all annoyed at this heckler.  (And for those who say Hillary is pandering, "mitoch shelo lishma, bah lishma.  She is a very powerful person).
