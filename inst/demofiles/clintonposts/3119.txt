<div>Hey y'all.<br />
<br />I'm sorry there have been no recent postings, but as Dre prepares for Medical School while I recover from surgery (there is no connection) that's just the way it's been.<br />
<br />Hopefully my recovery is going well enough to the point where I can once again allow myself the pleasure of alerting you to the dangers of this administration and its policies on healthcare, the environment, Social Security, the middle class, the lower class, heck, just about everything and everyone.<br />
<br />In the meantime. .  .<br />
<p> <strong>(An oldie but a goodie) You know you're a Republican when...</strong>
</p> <p> ...Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.</p> <p> ...trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.</p> <p> ...A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy. </p> <p> ...Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.</p> <p> ...the best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.</p> <p> ...providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy.  Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.</p> <p> ...global warming is junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.</p> <p>...being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host.  Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.</p>
