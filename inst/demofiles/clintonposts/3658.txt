<div>This evening I have been wandering through the internet, with my lantern, looking for Democrats involved in the Abramoff scandal. A few samples that certainly seem to represent most media sources are these articles: The Associated Press, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/entrepreneurs/feeds/ap/2006/01/04/ap2427573.html">â Update 28: Top Republicans Give Up Abramoff Donationsâ</a> By Pete Yost, 01.04.2006, 12:50 PM; Newsday.com, <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/printedition/nation/ny-uscong044574474jan04,0,5758106.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-print">âProbe's focus shifting to Congressâ</a> by J. Jioni Palmer, Washington Bureau, January 4, 2006; The San Francisco Chronicle, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2006/01/04/EDGV9GFGJM1.DTL">âAbramoff's web of corruptionâ</a>, Robert Scheer, Wednesday, January 4, 2006. Then there is the Washington Postâs bias - pick a page, any page. It is no surprise that mainstream media is certainly on the side of the progressive liberal demoracists.<br />
<br />Most media sources are depicting this whole scandal as Republican from top to bottom, inside out. They take their cue from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi who said Abramoff's confession in court was "not a surprise because this Republican Congress is the most corrupt in history and the American people are paying the price." You have to look hard in the media to find any demoracists ties to the scandal.<br />
<br />I donât think party affiliation is the most important point about the political contributions of scam artist and crook, Jack Abramhoff. Here are some names, without comment, that I have found.<br />
<br />
<span>Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., announced he would donate to charity $11,000 </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., $69,000<br />
<br />Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., said he would donate a $500 contribution to a local charity<br />
<br />Rep. Don Manzullo, R-Ill., said the congressman would return a $2,000</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., said he would give to a Rock Island, Ill., charity $2,000 </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Bush's re-election campaign is giving the American Heart Association $6,000</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, R-NY </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist said it planned to return $2,000<br />
<br />Sen. Max Baucus, R-Mt </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Byron Dorgan, D-ND<br />
<br />Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada, the minority leader, gave no indication that he'll give back a $5,000 contribution.<br />
<br />Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., won't return received contributions of more than $40,000<br />
<br />Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-RI, citing his support for American Indian causes, says he has no plans to return any of the $42,500 he took from tribes represented by GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff.<br />
<br />"He's proud to have their support," Kennedy chief of staff Sean Richardson said Wednesday. "He's got direct personal relationships with tribes. ... He looks at it as a human and civil rights issue, the fact that they're still not treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."<br />
<br />Kennedy, D-R.I., was the top congressional Democratic recipient of Abramoff-linked funds, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign watchdog group that analyzed contributions from 1999 to 2005.<br />
<br />Rep. Charles Rangel (D-Harlem) topped the list (New York elected officials) at $36,000 </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Rep. Tom Reynolds (R-Rochester) at $7,000 </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Rep. Nita Lowey (D-Westchester) at $2,000 </span>.<br />
<br />
<span>Sen. John Thune, R-SD, said he will donate $2,000 to charity </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Democrat South Dakota Sen. Tim Johnson, said he will return $8,250<br />
<br />Former minority leader Tom Daschle received Abramoff contributions<br />
<br />Other prominent Democrats receiving money from Abramoff include<br />
<br />Tom Harkin (D-Iowa)<br />
<br />Mary Landrieu (D-LA)<br />
<br />Barney Frank (D-Mass)<br />
<br />Fritz Hollings (D-SC)</span>
<br />
<br />Look <a href="http://www.capitaleye.org/abramoff.asp">Here</a> for a table breaking down the Abramoff contributions.<br />
<br />Before you go getting all judgmental on demoracist involvement be sure that you understand how to interpret their involvement. Ms. Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, cautions, "Do not fall into a Republican trap of equating technicalities on reporting, timing of reporting with not upholding an ethical standard of the House."<br />
<br />That would be Republicans B-A-A-A-A-D, demoracists GOOOD. Also remember that the demoracists love their Indian brothers and sisters and will do anything possible to help spread their money around for the common good even if it does involve occasional technical violations and/or poor timing of required reports. How could any progressive thinker believe that demoracist politicians who are known to be trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, reverent could possibly be involved in this scandal? Even if progressive liberal demoracists were involved they have pure hearts and only want what is best, and more important know what is best for America. That just is not the same as Republicans who are motivated by greed and power. Republicans B-A-A-A-A-D, demoracists GOOOD.<br />
<br />What a crock. These people are getting to be so far out ridiculous they are even starting to believe theirselves. Jack Abramoff is a soon to be convicted felon because of his plea bargain. The plea bargain specified Abramoffâs guilt, the involvement of an elected official (probably Rep. Bob Ney, R-OH), and two low level staffers. At this point everything is idle speculation and wishful thinking on the part of the progressive liberal demoracists and their media allies. Regardless of which way this scandal goes make no mistake about it. There are progressive liberal demoracists fingers in the pie right along with Republican fingers. The bottom line will be what indictments will be forthcoming for who and will they be convicted.</div>
