<div><p>Bill Kristol, editor of the right wing Daily Standard, thinks supporting Joe Lieberman is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/19/nyregion/19conn.html?hp&ex=1156046400&en=a5f97f0e22c0bfa9&ei=5094&partner=homepage">no-brainer for conservatives</a>, âForeign policy hawks and Bush doctrine believers and prowar types, we want Lieberman to win.â</p>

<p>Who knew sleepy little Connecticut, with all those plaid-panted suburbanites getting up to collect the paper from their doorsteps in the morning, would be the epicenter of the battle to save right wing foreign policy ideology through Holy Joe Lieberman?</p>

<p>So, what will the right do with Joe if they re-elect him?  Well, use him as a poster child of courseâ¦ to claim that the Democratic Party has no connection to the votersâ¦ that Joe Lieberman was âkicked outâ of his own party for the crime of supporting the Presidentâ¦ but that the voters of Connecticut saw fit to back the Administration in the person of Senator Lieberman.</p>

<p>Thatâs the narrative that has Newt Gingrich supporting Lieberman along with Kristol.  Itâs also why Ken Mehlman wonât put his lips together for Alan Schlesinger, the GOP nominee for Senate in Connecticut.  The narrative is a wonderful distraction from the Republicansâ troubles throughout the country, and Liebermanâs need for validation is playing right (no pun intended) into it.</p>

<p>Lieberman, on the other hand, strategizes that as long as he has the Republican Partyâs support, that he can keep national Democrats away from Ned Lamont by promising to caucus with Senate Democrats if he winsâ and thereby split the Democratic vote for Lamont.  Itâs a good plan, if Connecticut Democrats buy it as Democracy-lite.</p>

<p>But Liebermanâs support for the Democratic Party has always been running a distant second to his support for the Connecticut for Lieberman Party, even before it formally existed.  His decision to split his focus while running for Vice President and to keep his name on the Connecticut ballot for Senator in 2000 was a classic example.  His decision to openly break with the Gore campaign over military ballots in Florida after the election was another.  His excoriation of President Clintonâs personal morals in the middle of Monicagate precedes them and established Lieberman as the non-Democrat.  His alignment with Bill Frist and the fundamentalists over Terri Schiavoâs custody completed his move away from the Party, after pounding Democrats for questioning the war in Iraq throughout the Bush years.</p>

<p>If the Party faithful look at Joeâs promise to support the Democratic caucus with a jaundiced eye, itâs not hard to see why.  His entire candidacy is based on the concept that heâs a free agent, ready to make each call entirely on the basis of his own views.  Heâs answerable to no one, except possibly his wifeâs lobbying clients.</p>

<p>The next question will be whether the Democratic Party understands the power of being drawn into internal bickering over whether to treat Joe with delicate manners, in a truly Liebermanesque effort to hedge bets on the possibility of him rejoining the Senate.  If Karl Rove and Co can manage to split Democrats in this manner, their strategy will have already been successful.</p></div>
