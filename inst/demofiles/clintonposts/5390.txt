I was only about 8 years old I think<br />Or maybe I was 9 or maybe 10 ,but I think it was 8<br />I had a friend who lived up the street from me in Port <br />Her name was Hillary Burrell,an only child<br />She came from South Africa with her Mum and Dad<br />The family was born in England<br />Hillary's Father was in the Air Force<br />They lived in South Africa for 5 years <br /><br />I met her when she rode past on her new bike<br />I never had a bike,only a steel scooter<br />my Father ( a boilermaker) made for my Brother and I<br />Her bike was quiet,black tyres and a basket on the handlebars<br />Our scooter was loud,no rubber on the wheels<br />just steel ....it went fast and you certainly could hear it coming<br />It didn't matter what you crashed into ,the scooter remained in one piece<br />The boys loved to ride it around the block,down the driveways & over the gutters<br />Not much traffic in the 1940's.<br /><br />Back to the story of Hillary Burrell<br />We became friends as we always had lots of kids at our place<br />Mostly the boys were in Dad's shed fixing up things<br />The boy's liked Hillary,she had long black plaits,long black eyelashes<br />And she was 10 ,quite grown-up and she spoke so beautifully<br />Would she have flirted with the boys at 10<br />I didn't even know what flirting was<br />Except when my cousin who was 15 told me that Hillary<br />was flirting with the boys<br /><br />Now Hillary was enrolled in ballet lessons<br />In Melbourne ,in the city at at school<br />I was asked if I wanted to go and watch<br />Of course ,Mum said it was ok<br />So one Saturday morning we hopped on the bus<br />with Hillary' Mum.<br />We walked up from Flinders st to Collins St to the ballet school<br />Being in town was great,I loved going to the city<br />We used to meet my Aunt at Coles Cafeteria,<br />in the school holidays,with my 3 cousins<br />Lunch out was a big event ,only once mind you<br /><br />We went up to the ballet school in the lift<br />And there I saw another 20 or so young girls<br />all in their costumes (Leotards)-another new word<br />I sat with Hillary's Mum and watched them go through the lesson<br />After 1/2 an hour a break,then another 1/2 an hour all dancing<br />steps done to a piano player in the corner.<br />Hillary had Red Ballet shoes,some girls had black,some blue<br />and some pink and white as well<br />But I loved Hillary's red ones best<br /><br />After an hour and a half ,we troddled off home<br />down Elizabeth st to Flinders st<br />to catch the Garden City bus home<br />What an exciting day ,I knew what I wanted to be<br />Even at 8 I knew I wanted to be a ballet dancer<br />I dreamed about those red ballet shoes all the way home<br />We called into Hillary's place for a drink of milo and a biscuit<br />(They always had the best shortbread) her Mum made them<br />My Mum never made biscuits or cakes<br />Rice puddings ,sago pussings,bread and butter puddings were<br />her specialty<br /><br />That night I asked Mum if I could learn ballet<br />and have a pair of Red Ballet Shoes<br />I was not worried about the leotard,just the red shoes<br />Mum said " We might not be able to afford them"<br />" You ask Hillarys Mum how much the lessons are" and the shoes as well "<br />I did this and then brought back the brochure for Mum<br />" Oh heck " said Mum (I think she said heck or maybe it was (Oh Hell)<br /><br />My face dropped....I knew I wasn't going to get my wish<br />The cost of the ballet lessons plus the shoes were far out of our<br />price range<br />Mum didn't work,Dad's wages as a boilermaker were low<br />They were paying off the house<br />We didn't have this sort of income<br />Nobody in Garden City went to ballet<br />Some girls went to tap dancing at the local hall<br />I could go there Mum said<br />BUT.....I wanted a pair of those Red ballet shoes<br />so much, never argue with Mum...No meant No.<br /><br />So I never got to go to Ballet school<br />and I never went again on a Saturday morning with Hillary<br />But when I turned 10 my cousin paid for me to go ice skating<br />at the local St Kila St Moritz rink<br />My Aunt made me a short frilly frock<br />I was given a pair of boots and <br />my Dad made me the chrome blades<br />I thought I was Sonja Henie (Is that the right spelling).<br /><br />So the Red ballet shoes and the lessons<br />faded into the past as I skated round and round that rink<br />The ice skating lasted till I was 16 and if I do say so myself  myself<br />I cut a georgous figure in my little frilly short skirts<br />Whirling, dancing,figure skating every Saturday morning<br />Never a star but not bad even if I do say so myself....<br /><br />Ah-  Ballet and red shoes sounded nice<br />Especially to a starry eyed 8yr old<br />but so was ice-skating at the St Moritz rink,<br />when I grew up to be 10.<br /><br />Lois (Muse of the Sea) 25.4.06
