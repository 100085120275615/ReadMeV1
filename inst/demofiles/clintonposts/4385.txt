<p>An open letter from Bishop Riah Abu El-Assal, <br />
Anglican Bishop in Jerusalem: </p>

<blockquote>Dear Friends,

<p>For the past forty years we have been largely alone on this desert fighting a predator that not only has robbed us of all but a small piece of our historic homeland, but threatens the traditions and holy sites of Christianity. We are tired, weary, sick, and wounded. We need your help.</p>

<p>We have seen and we have been the recipients of the generosity of our American and British friends. We cherish the support of everyone throughout the world who stands with us in solidarity. Daily, I hear from many of them who express outrage at the arrogant and aggressive positions of President Bush, Secretary Rice, Senator Clinton, and Prime Minister Blair. I am saddened to realise just how much the deserved prestige of the United States and Britain has declined as a result of politicians who seem to devalue human life and suffering. And, I am disturbed that the Zionist Christian community is damaging Americaâs image as never before.</p>

<p>Little more than a week ago, we were focused on the plight of the Palestinian people. In Gaza, four and five generations have been victims of Israeli racism, hate crimes, terror, violence, and murder.</blockquote>  <a href="http://www.anglicancommunion.org/acns/articles/41/50/acns4170.cfm">Read more ...</a> </p>
