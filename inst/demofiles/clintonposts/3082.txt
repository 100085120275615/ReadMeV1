<div>G.O.P. strategists must be salivating over the notion of Howard Dean becoming chairman of the Democratic National Committee, especially when they pick up their Washington Post today and read under the headline: â<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48632-2004Dec8.html">Donât Lurch Right, Dean Urges Party</a>.â
<br />
<br />The former presidential candidate â and first choice of Republicans everywhere before John Kerry snatched the Democratic nomination from him and his denim-and-Ts-clad Deaniacs â emerged yesterday with some advice about how his party can âpunch our way off the ropesâ following across-the-board political defeats in November.
<br />
<br />As far as I can tell, he wants to dust off the playbook that failed him and use it as the basis for his partyâs platform.
<br />
<blockquote>âThere is only one thing the Republican power brokers want more than for us to lurch to the left, and thatâs for us to lurch to the right,â Dean said in a speech at George Washington University. âBecause what they fear most is that we may really begin fighting for what we believe: fiscal responsibility, socially progressive values for which Democrats have always stood and fought.â â¦
<br />
<br />âWe need to be able to say strongly and firmly and proudly what we believe because we are what we believe,â he said.
<br />
</blockquote>Dean may want to clue in Hillary Clinton to his âwe are what we believeâ strategy before she completes her <a href="http://consternations.blogspot.com/2004/11/hillarys-new-look-call-it-maggie.html">Maggie Thatcher makeover</a>. Just as a courtesy to the 2008 Dem frontrunner.
<br />
<br />According to the article, âDean sounded themes reminiscent of his failed bid for the Democratic nomination â and drew an enthusiastic response from his largely student audience â as he offered his prescription for the partyâs ailments.â Just what incoming Republican National Committee chairman Ken Mehlman wanted to hear.
<br />
<br />Mehlman and other Republican âpower brokersâ must relish their future opportunities to send out G.O.P candidates to do battle with Democrats sounding âthemes reminiscent of [Deanâs] failed bid.â Those themes apparently resonate with âlargely student audiences,â but not people who actually show up to vote on election day.
<br />
<br />In summation, âDean said Democrats tried and failed to become âRepublican liteâ â although he did not say when that occurred â and now need to redouble efforts to offer progressive alternatives to President Bush and the Republicans, in all regions of the country.â
<br />
<br />Redoubling efforts. Offering alternatives. Standing firm. It will take all that and more for the Democrats to get back on track. And Professor Dean knows spreading his progressive message far and wide will be key.
<br />
<br />My advice to Dean: Go shout it from the mountaintops. Or better yet, scream it. That way voters will be sure to hear you â and to vote accordingly.
<br />
