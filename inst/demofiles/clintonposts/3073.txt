<blockquote>China has a new and very powerful lobbyist inside Washington, D.C., and his name is George. The word inside Capitol Hill is that President Bush personally met with Senate and House leaders from both parties and demanded that they keep the ranks silent on China.<br />* * *<br />The real reason that both Democrats and Republicans are silent on the Hutchison deal, and the China scandal as a whole, is because lobbyists and major corporate backers bombard them. Major companies such as Wal-Mart, Disney, Boeing and Goldman Sachs have a vested interest in seeing that no minor political tiffs such as national security, nuclear weapons proliferation and simple torture of political prisoners interrupt their China dealings.<br />
<br />Liberal critics, Democrat spinsters and even the massive mouth of Senator Hillary Clinton are all silent on this issue. They could unload on Bush with a massive broadside aimed right at the heart of America's middle class. They could smash the Republicans in Congress â but instead, they have elected to remain as silent as the jailed dissidents outside Beijing. <br />
<br />Why? Several major players inside the Democratic Party have had long associations with Li Ka-Shing and his companies...</blockquote>A little while back I posted an article criticizing the Pan-Blue coalition in Taiwan that bows before the wealth of the Chinese.  Well, it's sad to report that we have our own Pan-Blue coalition in the United States, and it includes both of the major political parties.  We have let China get away with unfair trade practices, a rapid military build-up, outwardly threatening our democratic ally, and continually spying on our country and stealing our military technology.  And yet, China continues to enjoy Most Favored Nation trading status, and we even, at least outwardly, take their side on the Taiwan question.  There is no way we would let them get away with this if our leaders didn't feel that we needed their money.  There's no other explanation that I can think of.</div>
