<div><p>Thank you so much for all the kind words of support and suggestions in the last post. I apologize for taking so long to follow up. I was amazed by how many of you were right on about what's wrong with me. I have been diagnosed with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome">Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS)</a>. Additionally, my doctor found I have some pretty significant food allergies I was completely unaware of: cow's milk, dairy, goat's milk (so I can't have any cheese whatsoever), eggs, chicken, and I am gluten intolerant (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celiac">Celiac's Disease</a>). Let me just tell you that gluten is in EVERYTHING. I'm truly amazed at the foods where I find wheat hidden. Needless to say, this has all been completely overwhelming for me and is requiring a lifestyle overhaul. Because of my illness, I can no longer work full time, and I do not know when I will be better. I guess I'm in mourning right now. Mourning the fact that I can no longer eat&nbsp; my favorite foods and mourning the loss of my health. <br /> </p>

<p>What's so ironic about all of this is that I have worked as a paralegal for about 10 years now, and I spent some of that time representing people who had CFS and saw the complications that arose in their lives as a result of the illness. So I am painfully aware of what is in store for me. However, I never really understood the illness until now. </p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday I lost my job because my employer was unwilling to work with me to modify my schedule so I could work on getting better while still doing my job. I'm not quite sure what is next for me. I think it will be mourning the loss of my first house. It appears we will have to put it on the market before we ever even move into it. </p>

<p>Thank you to those of you wishing this story had a happy ending. I too hope it does. I'm already ready to get through the middle part. :)</p>

<p>Okay, that will be all I say about my tale of woe. </p>

<p>On to news of a crafty nature:</p>

<p>I have a couple of aprons to get out in the mail today and a few more I plan to make. I also received Hillary's <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/">Stitchettes</a> in the post yesterday, and I think this evening will be a nice time to get started on one of those. They are so darling, and I can't wait to get started on them. I have a few other things I'm getting ready to work on, but, as I'm sure you can imagine, there are a few other things taking priority at the moment.</p>

<p>I hope you all have a wonderful day. I'm going to do my darnedest to do the same. <br /> </p>

<p>xo</p></div>
