<font size="1"><br />Bill Clinton: ya gotta smile he's so darned congenial; the tarnished lost boy; the professional ex-president and he's only in his 50s; needy; ubiquitous--for years to come we'll be putting up with him like the brother-in-law who needs a place to sack out for a few nights because he can't make any of his quick-money schemes pan out and he just got evicted. I do feel sorry for him. Maybe he'll let God get through and stay with him despite his historic tendency to be distracted by whatever comes next. I will say some prayers for him tonight. And for Hillary. And for all who are swimming in this slough of deadly despond. Or whatever. I wish it was easier for me to pray and to read devotional material. My priorities look like a pretzel or a double Helix or something. There's so much.
