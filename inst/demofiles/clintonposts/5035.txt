<span>Things You Should Know(about me) </span><br />-When I need a chocolate fix, and the only chocolate in the house is a packet of hot chocolate, I'll pour the packet into a mug, add just a bit of water, stir and then eat the nice chocolate mush I've created. Love it.<br />-I have big feet, size 10's baby! Yup, and they're a tad bit wider since having two kids.<br />-I got to go to the San Diego zoo one time and actually go back behind the animal exhibits and see some of the animals. I was with a friend who's aunt worked at the zoo.<br />-My uncle took us to the beach one time and I refused to go in the water because of all the seaweed. It scared me and there was a ton of it in the water. So, instead, I took a nap.<br /><br />I was going to have a finished ware, but I forgot how time consuming seaming can be. I'm aiming for tomorrow.<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2035/1623/1600/000_1902.0.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2035/1623/320/000_1902.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2035/1623/1600/000_1903.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2035/1623/320/000_1903.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><br />In the mean time (I just really thought about what that phrase means - "mean" referencing the mathematical mean, or at least that's what I think), I'll show you pictures of some fabric I've picked up. The first picture is of some sheets, pillow cases and a little zipper bag I picked up at a couple of thrift stores. The other picture is of some material I bought at Joann's awhile back. I have no true plans for any of it, but I just couldn't resist. Love them, especially the stuff from the thrift store.<br /><br />I also ordered this lovely booklet from <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/">Wee Wonderfuls'</a> Hillary.<a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/booklet1.jpg"><img src="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/booklet1.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br />I am very excited.<br /><br />Recommended blogs tomorrow. No time right now.
