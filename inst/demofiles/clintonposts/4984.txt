<span><span>Well, the 2008 GOP presidential primary is already under way. <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/2008.htm">Polling Report</a> lists several polls conducted in mid-November, which support my theory that Giuliani is more popular with the base than McCain, even though the Mayor is more liberal than the Senator. According to Fabrizio, McLaughlin & Associates, a Republican polling firm, if the GOP primary was held today and the only candidates were Giuliani and McCain, Giuliani would receive 42% of the vote, McCain 24%, while 34% remain "unsure." Gallup also has similar findings, even with adding Jeb Bush to the mix. If it was between those three candidates, Giuliani would receive 47%, McCain 27%, Jeb 17%, with 9% remaining "unsure."<br /><br />Here's Gallup's findings when other candidates are added to the mix:<br /><br /></span><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><span>Candidate</span></strong></td><td><strong><span>%</span></strong></td></tr><tr><td><span>John McCain</span></td><td><span>10%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Rudy Giuliani</span></td><td><span>10%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Colin Powell</span></td><td><span>7%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Jeb Bush</span></td><td><span>3%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Condoleezza Rice</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Bill Frist</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Arnold Schwarzenegger</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>None</span></td><td><span>3%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Other</span></td><td><span>12%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Unsure</span></td><td><span>49%</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><br /><span>Also, McLaughlin &amp; Associates, another Republican polling firm, shows that registered Republicans favor Giuliani much more than Independents, but since Independents can vote in the primary in many states (including crucial NH), McCain receives an advantage (btw, I like this poll the best, it's much more realistic of the actual field in '08, especially since the Constitution has not, and I believe WILL NOT be amended for Arnold to run in time):<br /><br /></span><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><span>Candidate</span></strong></td><td><strong><span>Reps + Inds</span></strong></td><td><strong><span>Reps Only</span></strong></td><td><strong><span>Inds Only</span></strong></td></tr><tr><td><span>Rudy Giuliani</span></td><td><span>30%</span></td><td><span>34%</span></td><td><span>17%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>John McCain</span></td><td><span>18%</span></td><td><span>15%</span></td><td><span>26%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Jeb Bush</span></td><td><span>5%</span></td><td><span>7%</span></td><td><span>0%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Bill Frist</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>George Pataki</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td><td><span>3%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Mitt Romney</span></td><td><span>1%</span></td><td><span>1%</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Bill Owens</span></td><td><span>1%</span></td><td><span>1%</span></td><td><span>2%</span></td></tr><tr><td><span>Unsure</span></td><td><span>40%</span></td><td><span>37%</span></td><td><span>49%</span></td></tr></tbody></table><br /><span>With so many still unsure (and they should be, it's still way too earlier, and none of this data conforms to our <em>strategery</em> this year by running to the Right), Giuliani still has the advantage. We'll keep tabs on this and see if there's any fallout regarding the Kerik debacle (I doubt there will be any seriously, it will be forgotten in time, for example, who really remembers Linda Chavez outside of party circles these days?).<br /><br />Also, every poll on Polling Report shows that Hillary has a major advantage against all of the Democrats that are being speculated to run in '08, including Kerry and Edwards. This is really no surprise, as my first blog post pointed out. However, when Hillary faces Giuliani or McCain in the general, the polls show that either Republican would beat her, though McCain would beat her more than Giuliani (isn't it amazing how perception of "independence" has more weight than actual conservative/liberal ideology between McCain and Giuliani?).<br /></span></span><br /><span><span>But, looking at the electoral college map, I wouldn't be surprised if Giuliani would get more electoral votes than McCain, even if McCain has a better popular vote advantage. I ultimately believe that all the "strong reds" will remain strong even if we run either of these moderates (not any moderate, obviously, but these two, and only these two quite frankly). McCain may appeal more in the rust belt, but according to a recent <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1290855/posts">Zogby poll</a>, Giuliani is more popular than Hillary in NY. In fact, he's so popular in NY, he could run for guv against Spitzer and win or run for Senator against Hillary and win in '06. Thus, if it is a battle between Hil and <em>Time</em>'s 2001 "Person of the Year," the Mayor may (I can't believe I'm about to say this, but the polls back me up) make New York a RED STATE!</span></span></span><br />
