<p>We've had some great debate on this site over the Harriet Miers nomination, and I want to say thanks to everyone who's participated. Even those who have made just want to scream have, for the most part, put forth your arguments in a reasonable and civil fashion. Here I offer my apologies for any I've offended in a fit of emotionalism. And I also might offer a pre-emptive apology for any I might do it to in the near future. This stuff is important to me. </p>

<p>Which is kind of the whole point of this diary. If people want to disagree with me, that's fine. Even if they want to do it in a way that displays no class or ability to reason, that is also fine. What is not fine with me is <a href="http://betsyspage.blogspot.com/2005/10/anchoress-wishes-that-those.html"><strong><span>worthless garbage like this</span></strong></a> that denigrates the sincerity and conviction of others: </p>

<p></p><blockquote><p>What does irritate me is those conservatives who basically want to take their marbles and go home since they're disappointed in Bush's nomination. Fine, stay home next election. I hope your sanctimonious conservative purity is warm comfort through the years of Hillary's presidency. Remember that our choice is rarely between the perfect candidate and some other person. Mostly, we have to deal with two imperfect candidates and figure out which one would be less bad for the country. If you're lucky, there might even be a candidate you can like. My experience is that such politicians are rare.</p></blockquote><p>I don't know who the heck Betsy is, I've never read her page before, and I only got there because Hugh Hewitt (who slides down the scale of my estimation on an hourly basis) linked the aforementioned trash favorably. So, I have no idea why Betsy votes Republican, and don't really care to know. Those kinds of things are often personal, and I'm happy to have everyone in the big tent. </p>

<p>But let's hypothesize that Betsy is a small government conservative, who's primary objective is to see federal spending slashed. I'm behind that agenda, too, but it's not at the front of my burner. Nonetheless, I would never have been so belittling and insulting, in the wake of Medicare "reform," to berate upset FisCons like children and tell them to quit threatening to "take their marbles and go home." It would be insulting, and I'd be frankly ashamed to whisper such a thing to a friend, much less publish it on the Internet for thousands of people to see a day. </p>

<p>This may come as a news flash to Betsy and Hugh, and a lot of other people I've been reading and emailing with, but some of us have what we like to call <em>principles</em>. And we involve ourselves in this incredible mess called politics because we like to see those <em>principles</em> advanced. And when it becomes plainly obvious that after a protracted period of time, our principles are simply <em>not</em> going to be advanced - well, then, we have families and jobs and churches and whatnot that would be grateful for the extra time. </p>

<p>So, if you don't agree with my principles, or just don't hold them as strongly as I do, that's just fine with me. They're my principles after all. But if you go start calling me a kid because I try to live by the strength of those principles, you're just going to expose yourself as a second-rate party hack who views winning elections as an <em>end</em> rather than a <em>means</em>. May I be eternally saved from such a pitiful political existence. </p>

<p>So go ahead and sell out your own soul and use your hours and money to try and get the least crooked crook in office. If that's a profitable use of your time, more power to you. But by trying to look down your nose at folks who work in politics because they actually <em>believe in something</em>, you only make yourself seem even smaller than you actually are.</p></div>
