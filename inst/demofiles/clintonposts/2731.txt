<div><p>I was going through one of my (new) favorite blogs,<a href="http://autograt.blogspot.com/"> Auto-gratification</a>, the same writer as <a href="http://onceyougoasian.blogspot.com/">Once You Go Asian</a>. When I found this interesting survey which he got from another blogger...</p>

<p><strong>1. How old were you when you knew you were gay?</strong> I remember watching Jem and the Holograms when I was about 12...eeewww hahahahaha...but when I was 4 I rolled on the ground because my mom wouldn't get me a Carpenter's tape, (atleast it wasn't a Barbra or Cher tape) but I've always been a Drama Queen!....and then there was my 7th birthday when I argued with my mom because she wanted me to get a Batman cake (my cousin had the Superman cake)...but I wanted the CareBears cake...life is full of though choices isn't it...but seriously I think it was when I was in 1st year in highschool when I had this cute seatmate...<br />
<strong>2. Have you ever had sex with the opposite sex?</strong> Hell no! Thats just tooo hmmm :-)<br />
<strong>3. Who was the first person you came out to?</strong> My best friend...I don't really recall how it happened..<br />
<strong>4. Are you out to your family?</strong> To some...my younger sister watches Queer As Folk...I didn't notice that she was watching it until she came back to my room to return it.<br />
<strong>5. Do you want children?</strong> I'd go with Michael on this one, Not yet, but perhaps eventually; it's not a driving desire.<br />

<strong>7. Were you out in school?</strong> Nope....I don't think so..<br />
<strong>8. Is your best friend the same sex as you?</strong> Yes.<br />
<strong>9. If your best friend is the same sex, have you ever had sex with them? </strong>Hell no! They said he was cute...but I just can't see it....perhaps I need to change glasses.<br />
<strong>10. Would you prefer to date a guy taller than you or shorter than you?</strong> Doesn't matter to me....just not tooo short...5'8 and above...is fine.<br />
<strong>11. Have you ever been in a sling?</strong> No.<br />
<strong>12. Have you ever done a 3-way?</strong> Nope.<br />
