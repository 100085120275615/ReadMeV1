Lieberman has promised to run as an independent, but he may now be thinking again. His big name support, like the Clintons, may fall behind Lamont now that he's won the election. Certainly, now supporting Lamont is really the only thing, politically, that Hillary can do - especially considering her own support for the war. </div><div align="justify"></div><div align="justify"><br />Back in the UK, there are plans afoot regarding the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1840239,00.html">recalling of parliament</a> to discuss the middle east situation. I've said it before and I'll say it again - totally not worth it. And anyway, Blair's on <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5256610.stm">holiday </a>now. (On the subject of holidays, I really think the major question of the day is not about Blair and the middle east, but rather on Cameron - did he, or did he not, <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=399662&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;in_page_id=1770&ct=5">wax/shave his chest hair</a>? And does he actually think that <a href="http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2006/08/cameronBIG090806_600x600.jpg">picture </a>is attractive? I'd rather have Tony Blair. BTW - do the Tories have a policy on the current situation? They've been very queit?)</div><div align="justify"></div><div align="justify">MPs should really just get over it. This is not open season on Tony Blair. And this is not an issue that parliament needs to be recalled to discuss. There'll probably be a resolution and peace (okay, the way the resolution's going, probably not) before parliament is actually recalled. Which it won't be. If parliament actually thinks that our stance, other than all the diplomatic phone calls we seem to make, actually substantially matter, then they're wrong. It's a waste of time and energy, designed to do no good to Blairâs PMship.</div><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1338/1192/1600/tony.1.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1338/1192/320/tony.1.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1338/1192/1600/cameron080806_228x366.3.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1338/1192/320/cameron080806_228x366.3.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Who would you vote for?
