Wade'</i></a><br />(CNSNews)</b> Nathan Burchfiel 20 Jan 2006:  U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) on Thursday said he plans to vote against Supreme Court nominee Samuel Alito because the judge is "itching to overturn Roe v. Wade."<br /><br />Kennedy explained his position on Alito's confirmation, which is expected sometime next week, during a speech to the liberal Center for American Progress. The group, founded by John Podesta, who served as the chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, opposes Alito's confirmation because it fears Alito would cause "a profound shift in the ideological balance of the Court."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000103&sid=aH9jdYh_.5pA&refer=us"><i><b>Top Democrat on Judiciary Panel Opposes U.S. Supreme Court Pick</i></a><br />(Bloomberg)</b> 19 Jan 2006 -- The ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee said he will vote against the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Samuel A.
