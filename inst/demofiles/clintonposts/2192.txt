<em>âCongressional candidate Randy Graf stood on a town square gazebo Monday to rally about 100 of his supporters and preach about the effects of illegal immigration. Then the clouds rolled in, the thunder crashed and the rain started pouring down, forcing the crowd inside. Perhaps it was a proper welcome for Congressman Tom Tancredo, who swept in several minutes later. The Colorado Republican is used to igniting storms â it's just that they're usually in Washington, D.C.<br />Tancredo's drop-in at the East Side Trail Dust Town was an opportunity for him to reiterate his support for Graf, a Republican candidate in the Congressional District 8 race to replace retiring Rep. Jim Kolbe. Graf opposes a guest-worker plan or path to citizenship for those in the country illegally and wants to increase border security.â<br />

<em>â<strong>The Border and Illegal Immigration</strong> </em>

<br />While the other candidates have just recently acknowledged there is a border problem, Randy has been working on it for years! â</em> Please read more <a href="http://www.votegraf.com">here</a>.<br />
<br />So it seems the southern Arizona voters finally have a viable candidate who understands the illegal immigration problems and wants to do something about it. He is in a hard primary fight with âChamber of Commerce-Typeâ RINOs who would probably back the Presidentâs open borders-mass amnesty-free citizenship policies. So, whether you are from Arizona or Maine or any state in between check out this candidate and help if you are persuaded he is the best candidate. The democratic opponent for this US House seat will probably a Hillary supporter and an open borders advocate.</div>
