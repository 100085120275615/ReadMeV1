<div>There hasn't been a whole lot about the war in Iraq in the News for the past few weeks, because the News Media has been terrified that the Israelis might defeat Hezbollah and the Media might not be able to undermine Israel's efforts and prevent Victory from happening somewhere.<br />
<br />But the Democrat Party in America has not forgotten that there are still Political Gains to be realized by opposing the war here at home, and by bashing the Bush administration.<br />

</span>
<br />
<br />
<em>Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, facing sometimes hostile questioning Thursday from members of the Senate Armed Services Committee</em> ( Mrs. Bill Clinton), <em>defended his handling of U.S. forces in Iraq as two of his top aides testified that the country is on the verge of sectarian civil war. </em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />
<em>"Under your leadership there have been numerous errors in judgment that have led us to where we are,"</em> (Mrs. Bill Clinton) <em>said. "We have a full-fledged insurgency and full-blown sectarian conflict in Iraq."</em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />Mrs. Bill Clinton then went on to demand Rumsfeld's Resignation, and to lament the fact that we "<em>can't get new leadership that would give us a fighting chance to turn the situation around before it's too late..."</em>
<br />
<em></em>
<br />And on that note, I would like to take this opportunity to call for the resignations of Senator Mrs. Bill Clinton, Senator Dick Durbin, Senator John F. Kerry, Senator Ted Kennedy, Rep. John Jack Murtha, Senator Harry Reid, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Jeanine Garafalo, Jerry Springer, Al Franken, Cindy Sheehan, and Michael Moore. (Among others.)<br />
<br />Picture this...<br />
<br />Picture a patient who is afflicted with a brain tumor. This tumor has so affected the patient's judgment that he now does nothing but scream threats at everyone around him, and it has even caused him to attack his next door neighbors from time to time.<br />
<br />One team of doctors believes that this patient can be treated by sitting on the floor, burning incense, and talking about his feelings.<br />
<br />Another team of doctors believes that surgery is the only option.<br />
<br />Those in charge of the decision opt for surgery, but in the interest of representing all sides of the debate, the surgery will be performed in a room with the other team of doctors watching, and offering commentary as the surgery progresses, and the whole event will be broadcast to the World via closed circuit TV.<br />
<br />While the surgeon works, the other team of doctors screams and wails. "LOOK at all the BLOOD! He's sawed the top of his HEAD OFF! He can't possibly live with his brain exposed like that! This guy is a Quack! A Chimp! He doesn't know what he is doing! This has to be STOPPED! OH, THE HUMANITY!"<br />
<br />The other team will be allowed to turn off the lights, hide the surgeon's tools, bang drums, chant, march around in circles all over the operating room, and to place the cameras between the surgeon and the patient.<br />
<br />And every ten minutes, a poll is taken of the viewers, and the results will be yelled into the surgeon's ear through a Megaphone. (But only if they are unfavorable).<br />
<br />That's what is going on here.<br />
<br />Senator Mrs. Bill Clinton is on the Armed Services Committee. She wants to be President.<br />
<br />But remember this.<br />
<br />Her Husband and she, the Co-Presidents, had eight years in which to deal with Iraq, and even said that Saddam Hussein was a problem that had to be dealt with, stating in 1998 that the U.S. should adopt a policy of regime change in Iraq.<br />
<br />But they did nothing.<br />
<br />So now, when you hear her criticisms of the way the War is being run, remember that it is armchair quarter-backing, and take it as such.<br />
<br />This War would have been over a long time ago, were it not for the American Left, and the American News Media.</div>
