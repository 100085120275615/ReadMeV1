<span>46. Bruce Chapman </span>
</b>
</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Charges: </b>Founder of the misnamed âDiscovery                Institute.â Despite its pioneering title, Chapmanâs organization                seeks to make one of the worldâs oldest, dumbest ideas the prevailing                ideology. Seems to believe a petition signed by 400 PhDs and professors                is convincing proof of Intelligent Designâs widespread acceptance.                A lazy dissembler, he blames the lack of actual research and peer-reviewed                articles on ID on academic âblackballing.â Right, âcause Galileo                had it easy. Chapmanâs sole trailblazing achievement in the field                of academic inquiry has been in proving scientists can be even smugger-when                driven by theology.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Exhibit A: </b>Held high-level positions under                Reagan and Bush, Sr. Is not a scientist.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Sentence: </b>Infested and colonized by scabies                mites: eyeless, brainless parasites unique to humansâperfect evolved                to afflict us. Succumbing to the maddening itch, Chapman skins himself                alive.</span>

<span>               40. Tom Cruise</span>
</b>
</span>             <p>
<span>
<b>Charges: </b>Criminal narcissism. After mega-lawyer                Bert Fields threatened to sue The BEAST over Cruiseâs inclusion                in<a href="http://buffalobeast.com/50mostLoathsome2004.htm"> last                yearâs Loathsome List</a>, we responded by giving him the <a href="http://buffalobeast.com/73/index.htm">editorial                finger</a>, and bracing ourselves for the legal spanking of our                lives. Instead, the episode seemed to trigger a cascading ego crisis,                culminating in a rapid and irrecoverable image downgrade from exalted                idol to ridiculous buffoon. From his laughable claim of psychological                expertise to his worst acting performance everâas a man in loveâCruise                simply cracked up on camera in 2005, and a public hitherto willing                to overlook his obsessively inauthentic personality and comical                religious affiliation had finally had enough. Cruise is a perfect                example of a person who is simultaneously in love with and completely                unfamiliar with himself, living in perpetual fear of self-actualization,                and asserting a legal right to live free of criticism. A guy who                can do whatever the hell he wants, yet chooses to devote his life                to maintaining the public perception that he is somebody else.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Exhibit A: </b>âI care man, I care. I care about                you. I care about your children. I care about these people here                in this room. Every one of you. And I...I mean it. That is not just                some words to me. That is a promise.â Seriously, canât even act                like a human being.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Sentence: </b>A lifetime of forced, joyless sex                with famously beautiful women, only to have his colossal gay porn                library posthumously bequeathed to the Smithsonian by bitter, unloved                offspring.</span>

<b>
<span>39. Dr. David Hager</span>
</b>
</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Charges: </b>A Bush appointee to the FDA who                was the key figure in its rejection of emergency oral contraceptive                Plan B as an over the counter drug, which Hager bragged was the                second time in fifty years the FDA has ruled against the overwhelming                approval of its own advisory committee. The author of books like                <i>Stress and the Womanâs Body </i>and<i> As Jesus Cared for Women,</i>                Hager repeatedly sodomized his ex-wife for years against her will,                alternately apologizing for or denying it when confronted by her,                offering excuses like âYou asked me to do thatâ and âOh, I didnât                mean to have anal sex with you; I canât feel the difference,â she                told <i>The Nation</i>. Seems a bit fishy, a supposed authority                on womenâs health who canât detect such a significant distinction                with his most sensitive instrument.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Exhibit A: </b>âMy official comment is that I                decline to comment.â</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Sentence: </b>A three-day group ramming by the                multi-dildoed Oregon chapter of NOW, after which Hager will walk                with a pronounced limp, never to regain control of his sphincter,                and discover himself to be inexplicably pregnant.</span>

<b>
<span>37. Donovan McNabb</span>
</b>
</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Charges: </b>Played so poorly that his demoralized                and alienated teammates yearned for the return of ego-vampire Terrell                Owens. A chocolate commodity so inoffensive he makes Hershey bars                look militant. Responded indignantly to loopy criticism from the                head of the Philly NAACP, but laughed off Rush Limbaughâs racist                broadsides. Choked in the fourth quarter of Super Bowl; this year                he enjoyed the worst fourth quarter passer rating in the league.                Made over $11,000,000 in 2004.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Exhibit A: </b>Logged only significant playing                time this season with his mom in soup commercials.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Sentence: </b>Peon at a Campbellâs Soup cannery                in China. Flogged routinely for underperformance.</span>

<b>
<span>33. Johnny Damon</span>
</b>
</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Charges: </b>Any baseball player with highlights                in his hair should be faced with the same penalty system applied                to those using performance-enhancing steroids. Itâs ruining the                game. And if a ball player is going to grow a beard, it should be                a Charlie Manson/Thurman Munson scraggle of bushy whiskers, not                a neatly manicured and softly conditioned frame for your pretty                face. The only thing that got Damon to step into line and quit hair-farming                was a 52 million dollar check from the New York Yankees. Boston                prayed for the multi-bladed Gillette that officially made him a                Yankee to slip while gliding over his Adamâs apple and spill his                lifeblood into the bathroom sink. </span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Exhibit A: </b>Going from the Red Sox to the                Yankees is like fucking the guy that murdered your husband.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Sentence: </b>Killed by barrage of hurled D cell                batteries when he takes the field at Fenway next season.</span>

<b>
<span>16. R Kelly</span>
</b>
</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Charges: </b>As if videotaping himself urinating                on an underage girl wasnât bad enough, Kelly decided to follow up                by inflicting the worst piece of music in American history upon                the public consciousness. Kelly claims he is a genius for squeezing                out what are so far 12 installments of his âhip hopera,â âTrapped                in the Closetâ like so many virtually identical turds, with no variation                in musical content and a story line so patently terrible that it                soon became the subject of a parody-frenzy involving Saturday Night                Live, South Park, Mad TV, Jimmy Kimmel, and the Upright Citizens                brigade, among many others. Even his good songs all seem to be about                fucking underage girls.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Exhibit A: </b>Seriouslyâpissing on an underage                girl.</span>
</p>             <p>
<span>
<b>Sentence: </b>Trapped in a closet. Eventually                dies of thirst.</span>

<span>There are also some good "bend over and fuck me" Democrats, like Hillary Clinton and Joe Loserman, and your usual stable of Republican colostomy bags.  Don't miss the surprise at #4.<br />
