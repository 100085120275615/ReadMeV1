<strong>NHL</strong> â Great win for <strong>Carolina</strong> last night!!! Absolutely amazing game experience. Anyone who claims hockey is boring on TV, show them last nightâs game. True you need a screen with decent size and it may help to stand up as I did for most of the game, but wow, it is anything but boring. Your adrenaline pumps for 30 seconds when the Canes take the puck up the ice, then you cringe in fearful agony for the following 30 seconds when the <strong>Oilers</strong> launch their attack. The game was a marathon of wrecked emotions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Cam Ward</strong> is the reincarnation of <strong>Patrick Roy</strong>. And heâs only 22 years old.<br />Memo to âCanes: Lock him up to a long-term contract. Fast.<br />
<br />
<strong>Jim Rutherford</strong>: Thereâs a reason the man won <strong>
<a href="http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=94684">The Sporting Newsâ Executive of the Year</a>
</strong>. Not only the brilliant acquisitions of Weight and Recchi, but the entire assembly of this Hurricane squad, including two shutout-caliber goaltenders in Ward and Gerber. Any question as to the importance of two goaltenders can be answered by looking across the ice at the Edmonton squad.<br />
<br />Horrible sight last night seeing <strong>Roloson</strong>âs hit. Iâm sorry he is knocked out of the Finals. Yes, I want Carolina to win, but I want them to beat Edmonton at their best.<br />
<br />Did not know much about <strong>Edmonton</strong> coming into the Series except that their coach is <strong>Craig MacTavish</strong>. I remember watching him play. Why? He was the last player to skate without a helmet. In other words if he was their coach I knew theyâd be tough. However I had no idea theyâd be as physically imposing as they were last night. The Canes threw some âslobber knockersâ of their own, like the hit from <strong>Commodore</strong>, but <strong>Pronger</strong> and <strong>Laraque</strong> are beasts â 6â6â 220 and 6â3â 255 respectively.<br />
<br />
<strong>Prongerâs</strong> penalty shot was thing of beauty. Like most professionals, he made it look so easy. A man that size should not be as graceful as that. He literally glides when he skates.<br />
<br />
<strong>NBA</strong> â As much as I want <strong>Miami</strong> to win, I am afraid <strong>Dallas</strong> carries too many weapons. It is going to be a fantastic <em>
<strong>
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/">Clash of the Titans</a>
</strong>
</em>. Dallas wonât be able to match up with the inside dominance of Shaq, and Miami wonât be able to slow down the up-tempo firepower of the Mavs. Dallas wins the title in Game 7.<br />
<br />Love both coaches in this battle. <strong>Riley</strong> is a true disciple of <strong>
<a href="http://www.kimsoft.com/polwar.htm">Sun Tzuâs</a>
<em>
<a href="http://www.kimsoft.com/polwar.htm"> Art of War</a> </em>
</strong>and <strong>Avery Johnson</strong> is a master strategist and motivator in his own right. Canât wait to see these two match wits.<br />
<br />Great to see <strong>Shaq Diesel</strong> in the Finals again. It was always complete nonsense to hear the argument Shaq and <strong>Kobe</strong> canât win without each other. Of course they can, however Kobe always needed Shaq more than the other way around. Why? People want to play with Shaq. Look at the chemistry between him and Wade. No one however wants to play with âKob-Me.â<br />
<br />Had to record <strong>
<a href="http://www.wwe.com">WWE Raw</a>
</strong> last night. Great drama with <strong>Triple H</strong> and <strong>Vince McMahon</strong>. Canât wait to see the fallout next week from Vince getting the Pedigree.<br />
<br />Speaking of WWE, anyone else think <strong>Rob Van Dam</strong> looks like <strong>Paul Heymanâs</strong> son?<br />
<br />Glad to see <strong>Randy Orton</strong> back. Hope he can keep is out-of-the-ring behavior under control.<br />
<br />Memo to media: Stop the <strong>Michelle Wie</strong> mania. <strong>ESPN</strong> carried live updates of her attempt to qualify for the US Open. She has not accomplished anything yet. Yes sheâs 16 years old and incredibly talented, but Iâd be more impressed if she beat <strong>Annika Sorenstam</strong> a couples times first, rather than just trying to make the field where <strong>Phil</strong> and <strong>Tiger</strong> reign.<br />
<br />The <strong>Dodgers</strong> so far made the move of the year in their signing of <strong>Nomar</strong>. Heâs been a real sparkplug for the offense. Just hope he stays healthy.<br />
<br />Hope <strong>Pujols</strong> returns to the <strong>Cardinals</strong>â lineup as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
<strong>Clemens</strong>, excited to see you pitch again, but the <strong>Astros</strong> could have used you several weeks ago.<br />
<br />Anyone else notice that 6/6/06 is the first full day of the <strong>Yankees</strong> being in 1st place? Seems like an Omen to meâ¦Wait, and Hillary is their Senator too. How fitting.<br />
