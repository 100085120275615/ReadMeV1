So Dearies, I desperately want to write something that doesn't belong in the DUH files.<br />
I want to write something that belongs in the WHAT (Who the Hell Anticipated That) files.<br />
Unfortunately, there's nothing really to go into those files this week.  Or last week.  Or the week before.<br />
<ul><br />
<li>Bush's popularity looks like it might have a 3 percent uptick after offing Zarqawi.</li><br />
So now everybody that has a cable show is talking about how he's back on top.  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13324919/">After all, he's closing in on 40 percent approval!</a>  Is there anything this man can't do?  (Other than Make the US safer, balance the budget, respect the rule of law, make the country better, lead us as a people, speak to the better angels of our nature, secure our ports, put an end to egregious corporate profiteering, oh, and use the English Language as a means of communication.)<br />
Guess not.<br />
<li>Karl Rove might not be indicted</li><br />
Or maybe he will be.  We've heard that he will, now we've heard that he won't.  Of course, the people that say that he won't are the New York Times.  Still the paper of record, they rarely make mistakes (offer not valid if on the subject of Wen Ho Li, WMD, War in Iraq, Bill Clinton, Bill and Hillary's Marriage, Bush's Infallibility, and David Brooks).<br />
Hard to believe that the second most powerful man in Washington (after Dick Cheney) would get off.  Glad it will save King George having to type out a pardon; with his spelling skills, the task might have been too much for the poor dear.<br />
<li><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/hillary-and-kerry-bring-m_b_22996.html">Hillary Clinton is a pandering Triangulator</a></li><br />
This is news?  Although I will sleep better at night knowing my American Flag is safe from being burned.<br />
<strong>AND</strong><br />
<li>Gays still hate America</li><br />
Fortunately, the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/06/15/constitutional-convention-gay-marriage/">good Christian Folks Â of America are trying to get 34 States</a> to call for a Constitutional Amendment to protect us from people enjoying their lives.<br />
</ul><br />
Really Dear Ones, the list just keeps going on.  Iraqis celebrate George Bush's visit by blowing up the 2500th US Soldier,</a> Anne Coulter is still a meanie, and the Theory of Gravity is just another conspiracy to deny God's power in our lives.  <br />
But we knew all this.<br />
In the meantime, I'll keep an eye out for the WHAT file.
