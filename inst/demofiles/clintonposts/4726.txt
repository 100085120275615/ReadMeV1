<p>Recently on our radio show Pundit Reveiw Radio we discussed the current effort underway in Mass to amend the state&#8217;s constitution to define marriage as between one man and one woman.</p>
<p>One of the guests on the program Mark Solomon from mass Equality claimed that opposing same sex marriage was a &#8220;form of discrimination&#8221; and that fundamentally, the issue, was a &#8220;civil rights&#8221; issue best decided, not by the people, but via the courts.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://www.family.org/cforum/fosi/marriage/nac/a0031029.cfm">excellent article by Glen Stanton </a>which deals with that very question. </p>
<blockquote><p>Gay activists have gained their ground through emotional manipulation and by diverting the publicâs attention away from the thousands of scientific studies that tell us how healthy child-development requires mothers and fathers. They have manipulated us by high-jacking civil rights language. And as a result, millions of boys and girls will be subjected to intentionally motherless and fatherless families for no other reason than to fulfill the desires of adults who want such families.</p></blockquote>
<p>He points out correctly that the vast majority of Americans including Democrats, African-Americans, politicians such as Hillary and Bill Clinton, John Kerry, and Barbara Boxer all oppose Same-Sex marriage. </p>
<blockquote><p>The real reason the overwhelming majority of African-Americans and two-thirds of all Americans oppose same-sex marriage is because they understand it fundamentally redefines the family and says mothers and fathers donât matter for children. And the black community, more than any other, has suffered under the ravages of this. The Rev. Walter Fauntroy, coordinator of the 1963 March on Washington and president of the National Black Leadership Roundtable, recently warned, âDonât confuse my people who have been the victims of deliberate family destruction by giving them another definition of marriage.â</p></blockquote>
