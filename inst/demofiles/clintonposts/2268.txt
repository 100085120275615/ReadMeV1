<p> In "King of Cons," Tonken reports a private meeting with Hillary Clinton in a van in Los Angeles during which <span>"I told her about virtually every penny I'd spent on her behalf. I let her know what I was doing and had done for each event of hers."</span> </p> <p>  On July 16, 2001, <a href="http://www.peterfpaul.com">Peter Paul</a> wrote a <a href="http://www.hillcap.org/default.php?page_id=13">letter to Hillary Clinton</a> notifying her personally that his enormous contribution to her Senate campaign, of which the Spago and Bel Air events represented a small portion, had not been reported. The letter stated in part, <span>"As you recall, I hosted a private fundraising luncheon for you at Spago, and a fund raising tea at Mrs. Gershmanâs Beverly Hills Estate on June 9, 2000, and paid certain expenses in connection with that event in addition to making a commitment to contribute $150,000 in stock to your campaign."</span> Paul concluded by demanding that the Clinton campaign return his money. This request was ignored.</p> <p> The final report made to the Federal Election Commission by the Clinton Senate campaign contains no reference to any expenses paid on behalf of the campaign by Peter Paul, Aaron Tonken or even Paul's company, Stan Lee Media for the Spago and Bel Air fundraising events of June 9, 2000.<br />
