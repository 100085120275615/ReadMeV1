Liberal blogger<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2004_11/005084.php"> Kevin Drum </a>asks "What's Next" for liberals.<br /><em><span><blockquote><em><span>"Well, I don't know. The lefties will say we need to stop trying to be Republican Lites, the DNCers will say we need to move to the center, the New Republic will say we need to get serious about national security, Amy Sullivan will say we need to pay more attention to religion, George Lakoff will say we need better issue framing, the Washington Monthly editors will say we need a more potent vision, etc. etc. I'm not sure who's right, but we'll figure it out.<br /><br />But one thing not to do is hide under the blankets and give up. We lost an election, that's all. There will be another one in a few years, and if we persuade a few more people that we're right, we'll win it. Tomorrow would be a good day to start doing that persuading."</span></em></span></em></blockquote><br />I think Democrats need to rethink their strategies. The best way to achieve victory is from the grassroots up, not the top down. The Republican grass roots effort started in 1964 with Barry Goldwater. 16 years later, Ronald Reagan won the Presidency and started implementing the Goldwater vision.<br /><br />There was also a second Republican Revolution that until now has gone unnoticed. It was conceived in Jerry Falwell's moral majority, which supported Reagan. But ideologically, Reagan's governing philosophy was not dependent upon Falwell. It was a loose association.<br /><br />The real birth of the second Republican renewal started with Pat Robertson's run for office in 1988, and the founding of the Christian Coalition with Ralph Reed as its head. Just as Goldwater was ill-suited to give practical political legs to his vision, Robertson was ill-suited to be the embodiment of his vision as well. But like "young" Ronald Reagan, young Ralph Reed focused on the development of a political organization to implement the vision.<br /><br />Karl Rove is not a genius. He was and is simply smart enough to tap into the political organization developed by Reed. George W. Bush is the beneficiary of that movement that also started 16 years before its full impact on national politics was felt.<br /><br />A word about the divisions within the Republican party. The Republican party is divided into four factions.<br /><blockquote><p>1) The old Taft Republicans. These are the old Northeastern WASP Republicans. George H.W. Bush was the embodiment of this group, as is Arlen Specter - the pro-business GOP. This group greatly misunderstands and even resents Group 4 Moral Values Republicans and are most vulnerable to being picked off by another ideological movement.<br /><br />2) The limited government Republicans. Both Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich represented this group. These are also the term-limits Republicans who honored their pledges to serve only six years in the Legislature. These guys HATE, HATE, HATE the deficits and the debt. They love tax-cuts and slashing government programs. If you are against deficits, these guys will jump in bed with you at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />3) National Security Republicans. This group is the result of a backlash against the anti-war movements of the 60's and early 70's, and also newly minted anti-terrorists hawks. Many of these people are the "Reagan Democrats" and "9/11 Democrats." Think Zell Miller, Ed Koch, Sam Nunn, Rudi Giuliani etc. Also, think of libertarian bloggers like <a href="http://www.instapundit.com/">Glenn Reynolds</a>, and <a href="http://rogerlsimon.com/">Roger L. Simon</a>, and <a href="http://www.deanesmay.com/">Dean Esmay</a>.<br /><br />4) The Moral Values Republicans. These are the quintessential Republican "little people." They/We are animated by fighting judicial tyranny. We resent our values being trampled upon by both the unelected whims of federal judges, and by the propaganda of Hollywood and the Press. This group is naturally isolationist and not particularly interested in the day-to-day practical aspect of governing. We are determined to have the Supreme Court retrofitted to immunize the Society from cases like the Massachusetts Supreme Court's attempt to impose gay marriage on the nation. </p><p>Contrary to most liberals' fears, we would be content to let issues like gay marriage, abortion, etc be resolved in the legislature. What this group has in common with liberals is a high value for individual freedom. What liberals don't understand is that freedom for us includes the freedom from having liberal sensibilities imposed on us from outside. Having had our values trampled onby the judiciary since 1962, we are not animated by the prospect of reversing that imposition, i.e. the fear of liberals of the religious right imposing our values on them is unfounded.<br /><br />What is important is permanently changing the structure of government to prohibit judges from making up the law without popular consent. Education reform is also very high on the agenda of Moral Values Republicans. Tax policy, the size of government, and pro-business policies are secondary to this group, and liberal economic policies are easily tolerated and even sometimes championed by members of this group.<br /><br />This group is also your natural "FREE SPEECH" ally, if you consider political correctness of universities and campaign finance reform to be wrong. But remember, "FREE SPEECH" to these people also means the right to erect nativity scenes on public property.<br /></p></blockquote><br />Confusing the members of the four Republican factions with one another is endemic in liberal circles. Republicans may be members of more than one group, and sometimes resent being called out for the primary agendas of other Republican groups which they do not agree with. Consider how some moral values Republicans like Pat Robertson are adamantly opposed to the War in Iraq, and old-style GOP Senator Arlen Specter warning the White House not to nominate anti-Roe judges.<br /><br />So what lessons should Democrats take from these two consecutive conservative movements?<br /><blockquote>1) You must stand FOR something, not just against something. For 32 years prior to Goldwater, the Republican party was in the wilderness. Ike was the Clinton of the Republican party, i.e. he made them feel good for 8 years, but offered no real ideological raison d'etre for the Republican party. The Taft Republicans were primarily animated by trying to undue the work of FDR - something that they ultimately were never able to accomplish, even to today.<br /><br />2) Ideas matter greatly. You must first establish your fundamental core beliefs and stick to them regardless of whether those ideas are quickly accepted by the populace. One of the great lines in GWB's acceptance speech at the RNC was "you know where I stand." It was true. Even GWB's most ardent opponents knew where he stood. Even now, I am confused about what Kerry's governing philosophy would be. The one clear ideological concept that I was able to discern was internationalism - something I regard as secondary, i.e. Internationalism for its own sake seems vaccuous to me, elevating process over substance.<br /><br />3) It takes time. The American electorate is tired of those on the left trying to use the courts to circumvent the electoral process. Trust me when I say that the success of the gay marriage bans in 11 states was more about limiting the power of the runaway judiciary than it was about homophobia or gay-bashing. You want gay marriage? Fine. Do the hard work of convincing the American population that it is a worthwhile evolution in our society. Trying to cram it down the throats of social conservatives by judicial fiat is a recipe for division.<br /><br />Both of the conservative ideological movements took 16 years to reach maturity in Presidential politics, and the Goldwater movement took 30 years to reach maturity in the Legislature. A true Progressive ideological movement is likely to require the same maturation process.<br /><br />4) Renewal. Every philosophy needs ideological renewal. The conservative ideological renewal is well into its second phase. There was 24 years between the birth of its first ideology and its second ideology. The Liberals had a similar time lag in their 20th century ideological successes - first the New Deal, then the Great Society. But since then, there has not been any great ideological liberal movement. Liberalism has become reactionary, defending the gains of movements that are 70 years old and 40 years old respectively.</blockquote><br />Conclusion: Unless liberals are content to spend the next several decades in the political wasteland of American politics, like the early 20th century Republicans, an ideological renewal is necessary. Also necessary is patience, perserverance and a willingness to do the hard work of gaining grass roots popular support for your causes.<br /><br />The whine of "divided America" sounds like sour grapes to conservatives. And any expectation that conservatives will not press ahead with an agenda and movement that we have been building for now 40 years is extremely naive. For too many years, we were in the minority. And for too many years our issues were ignored, passed over, and dismissed. Having worked so hard for so long, we intend to have our satisfaction.<br /><br />The onus is on liberals to create and build their own alternative movement(s). Certainly, liberals have some things in common with all of the identified factions of the Republican party described above, and with hard work and persistence could find issues which would enable you to peel off voters from the above voting block. Good luck.<br />
