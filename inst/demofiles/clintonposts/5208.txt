Darkly </a> âIsn't it amazing how certain simple phrases can evoke such intense emotions?  âI love you.â âWill you marry me?â  âItâs a boy.â â Head up, ass down, son.â âYour son has been wounded in a VBIED attack.â<br />Yup. That about covers it. But itâs the last one that stabs at me to this day. Just saying those words will bring tears to my eyesâ¦ alarm to my heartâ¦ pain to my spirit. It was a year ago that my view of the world was skewed:â (<a href="http://somesoldiersmom.blogspot.com/2006/08/through-mind-darkly.html">read more</a>)<br /><br />GayPatriot of <a href="http://gaypatriot.net/">GayPatriot</a> writes <a href="http://gaypatriot.net/2006/08/24/hillary-holding-up-aids-funding">Hillary Holding Up AIDS Funding </a> âSen. Hillary Clinton is taking up where her husband left off.   During President Bill Clintonâs term, he repeatedly âzeroed-outâ AIDS funding his the Presidential Budget he sent up to Congress.  You never heard much about it, because it was the post-1995 Republican-controlled Congress (mostly thanks to then Rep. Tom Coburn and Sen. Arlen Specter) that restored and increased funding each year.  Well, hereâs what Hillary is up to now â threatening renewal of the Ryan White Act.â (<a href="http://gaypatriot.net/2006/08/24/hillary-holding-up-aids-funding">read more</a>)<br /><br />Sachi of <a href="http://biglizards.net/">Big Lizards</a> writes <a href="http://biglizards.net/blog/archives/2006/08/iraqi_forces_sh.html">Read All About It!

There is a good reason for this: it's going very well.  âIf it bleeds, it leads;â but that means that if it's good news, newspapers, magazines, and broadcast news just aren't interested.

This comes as the fragile consensus at the UN Security Council on Iranian defiance appears to have unraveled â¦ Given the hype over the supposedly apocalyptic impact of August 22nd, it's difficult to get too excited over this latest assertion. The only surprise that Iran could possibly unveil is a functional nuclear device -- and many already figure they have at least a few. Perhaps the only way we could be surprised is if the Iranians renounce the uranium enrichment that has the UNSC threatening sanctions.â (<a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/007884.php">read more</a>)<br /><br />Erick at <a href="http://www.redstate.com/">RedState</a> writes <a href="http://www.redstate.com/stories/elections/2008/is_john_mccain_running_in_08_from_a_third_party">Is John McCain Running in '08 From a Third Party? </a> âWhat do Air America Radio, Barack Obama's Senate campaign, the Clinton Global Initiative, Democratic gubernatorial candidate John DeStefano in Connecticut, the campaign of Democratic Governor Jennifer Granholm in Michigan, NoIraqDraft.com, Rock the Vote, PurpleOcean.org which is the online activism hub of the Service Employees International Union, and Rosie.com, the personal blog of Rosie O'Donnell have in common with John McCain?â (<a href="http://www.redstate.com/stories/elections/2008/is_john_mccain_running_in_08_from_a_third_party">read more</a>)<br /><br />Andi of <a href="http://andisworld.typepad.com/welcome_to_andis_world/">Andiâs World</a> writes <a href="http://andisworld.typepad.com/welcome_to_andis_world/2006/08/gold_star_famil_1.html">Mr. President, We Deserve Better </a> âAfter reading the story below, I became frustrated.

Islam has a problem with hate and violence, and for the most part it is not being addressed by Muslim leaders. Quite the opposite; for the most part there are all too many Muslim teachers, leaders, and schools who teach and promote hateful doctrines.  This, in and of itself, is not an insuperable difficulty. There are those in Christianity, such as Fred Phelps, who teach hateful doctrines. The problem with regard to Islam is that one, the problem is so widespread; two, that very few moderate Muslims act in a concerted, coherent fashion to save their religion; and three, that the Western doctrine of multiculturalism prevents many of us from recognizing, much less doing something about the problem.â (<a href="http://theredhunter.com/2006/08/the_nature_of_our_enemy_part_ii_a_problem_in_islam.php">read more</a>)<br /><br /><a href="http://dadmanly.blogspot.com/">Dadmanly</a> writes <a href="http://dadmanly.blogspot.com/2006/08/seasons.html">Seasons</a> â...[A]s a consequence of these unfolding events, Mrs. Dadmanly and I have done a lot of soul searching.
