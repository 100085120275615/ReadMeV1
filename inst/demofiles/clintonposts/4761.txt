<p>The 12th imam or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi">Mahdi</a> is supposed to be a man, or so the legend goes, but these are just details.  In many ways, it seems to us that Hillary Clinton could be the Mahdi &#8212; their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahdi">missions are similar</a>.  The Mahdi is to &#8220;fill the Earth with peace and justice as it will have been filled with injustice and tyranny before then.&#8221;  Sounds like Hillary to us.  Mahmoud Ahmedinejad thinks the Mahdi <a href="http://www.iranian.ws/iran_news/publish/article_10945.shtml">will appear soon</a>, and he&#8217;s a canny fellow &#8212; does he have 2008 in mind?
