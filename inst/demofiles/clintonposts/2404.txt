<span>OCTOBER SURPRISE?</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Is the Bush gang laying the groundwork for an attack on Iran?</span>
<br />
<br />

<br />[Laura Rozen] Is the marketing campaign against Iran begun? Here was the deputy director of operations for the joint chief of staffs at the Pentagon yesterday . . .<br />

<br />Iran is supporting Bin Laden anyway, via their intelligence services and funding, so going after Iran is really the same thing as getting Bin Laden.<br />

<br />[Steve Benen] In other words, there are a number of high-ranking Republican officials who want a confrontation with a Middle Eastern country they believe is an imminent threat. Intelligence officials consider the foreign foe a problem, but haven't produced the evidence the Republicans want to see. Therefore, there must be something wrong with the intelligence officials â they're getting in the way of a perfectly good war. Sound familiar?<br />

<br />[NYT] The report ... is partly a campaign document, a product of the Republican strategy of scaring Americans into allowing the G.O.P. to retain control of Congress this fall. . .<br />
<br />But even more worrisome, the report seems intended to signal the intelligence community that the Republican leadership wants scarier assessments that would justify a more confrontational approach to Tehran. It was not the work of any intelligence agency, or the full intelligence panel, or even the subcommittee that ostensibly drafted it. The Washington Post reported that it was written primarily by a former C.I.A. official known for his view that the assessments on Iran are not sufficiently dire. . .<br />
<br />All in all, this is a chilling reminder of what happened when intelligence analysts told Vice President Dick Cheney they could not prove that Iraq was building a nuclear weapon or had ties with Al Qaeda. He kept asking if they really meant it â until the C.I.A. took the hint. . .<br />
<br />If the Republicans who control Congress really wanted a full-scale assessment on the state of Iranâs weapons programs, they would have asked for one, rather than producing this brochure.<br />

<br />Columbia University's Gary Sick, formerly an official in the National Security Councils of presidents Ford, Carter, and Reagan, doesn't think much of the House Intelligence committee report . . .<br />

<br />[AJ] As an aside to my broader point, it's worth noting, for pure hilarity, that the House intel report the article cites, aside from being fairly idiotic overall, has an interesting perspective on Iran's missile launch locations. If you scroll down to page 15, you'll see that the report, written by the House committee responsible for intelligence, appears to have the ranges for Iranian missiles (including one that doesn't exist, natch) originating from . . . wait for it . . . Kuwait! Apparently Iran took over Kuwait and nobody even noticed. . .<br />

<span>The politics of all this: Will a fall vote to authorize Bush to use force against Iran âif necessaryâ be the new litmus test for loyalty to national security, leading up to the 2006 elections?</span>

<span>Reason #914 for invading Iraq: to weaken Iran!</span>

<br />Greg Sargent has the excerpts from Joe Lieberman's appearance on the Glenn Beck show during which Beck said a whole series of absurd things about Iran to which Lieberman happily agreed. The highlight is that Lieberman assented to Beck's view that "The weapons of mass destruction was a nice side benefit" of the Iraq War, but that fundamentally, "We were trying to go and pop the head of the snake in Iran."<br />
<br />
<span>[NB: Since Iraq under Hussein (whatever one thinks of him) was the main bulwark AGAINST Iran in the region, this assertion is nothing short of delusional â and Lieberman went along with it?]</span>

<span>You know that no rhetorical excess is too much for these people â and I think weâve found the new Republican meme for the 2006 elections</span>

<br />Bush is trapped in a self-generated dynamic that eerily recalls the centrifugal forces that spun apart his fatherâs presidency. . . . Outdoing the father by subduing "the wimp factor," the son has not grasped that it was the father's presumed strength and not his weakness that undid him in the end.<br />
<br />President Bush's staggering mismanagement of the Iraqi occupation. . . has until recently served his purpose of seeming to defy the elements of chaos he himself has aroused. By stringing every threat together into an immense plot that justifies a global war on terrorism, however, he has ultimately made himself hostage to any part of the convoluted story line that goes haywire.<br />
<br />Because Bush has told the public that Iraq is central to the war on terror, the worse things go in Iraq, the more the public thinks the war on terror is going badly. Asked at his press conference what invading Iraq had to do with Sept. 11, Bush seemed so dumbfounded that at first he answered directly. "Nothing," he said, before sliding into a falsely aggrieved self-defense -- "except for it's part of -- and nobody has ever suggested in this administration that Saddam Hussein ordered the attack."<br />
<br />Asked about sectarian violence in Iraq, Bush's voice suddenly went passive. "You know, I hear a lot of talk about civil war." Indeed, he might have heard it from his top generals, John Abizaid and Peter Pace, who testified before the Senate on Aug. 3, seriously off-message from Bush's P.R. campaign of relentlessly stressing "victory." As Abizaid said, "Sectarian violence is probably as bad as I have seen it." . . .<br />

<br />[A] all three of Connecticut's incumbent Republicans--Reps. Rob Simmons, Chris Shays, and Nancy Johnson--are facing tough fights for their political lives . . . One thing's clear: the three Democratic House challengers here aren't at all hurt by the fact they are endorsed by both Lieberman and Lamont . . .<br />

<br />[August 10] Lieberman said that he will continue to support the Democrats running for Congress even though they now support Lamont.<br />
<br />"It is a little bit harder, but I have endorsed the three of them," he said. Lieberman endorsed Joe Courtney over Rep. Rob Simmons, R-2, and Chris Murphy over Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-5.<br />

<span>Scientists say they now can extract stem cells from already-existing embryos without destroying them. Countless embryos are created through in vitro fertilization, and end up being discarded. So what objection could the Bush administration have to allowing stem cell research now?</span>
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/science/24stem.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/science/24stem.html</a>
<br />But Emily Lawrimore, a White House spokeswoman, suggested that the new procedure would not satisfy the objections of Mr. Bush, who vetoed legislation in July that would have expanded federally financed embryonic stem cell research. Though Ms. Lawrimore called it encouraging that scientists were moving away from destroying embryos, she said: âAny use of human embryos for research purposes raises serious ethical questions. This technique does not resolve those concerns.â . . .<br />
<br />
<span>[NB: But Bush has ALREADY agreed to let stem cell lines derived from embryos be used for research. And anyway, the mere use of embryos was not his original objection. See below]</span>

<br />Yet we must also remember that embryonic stem cells come from human embryos that are destroyed for their cells. Each of these human embryos is a unique human life with inherent dignity and matchless value. . . . Some people argue that finding new cures for disease requires the destruction of human embryos . . I disagree. . .<br />

<span>Plan B (the âmorning afterâ pill, a.k.a. âemergency contraceptionâ) is finally approved for use without a prescription â which can help reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, and hence abortions. This is the first sensible thing Iâve seen come out of this govt in a long time.  But a big piece of the credit goes to Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Patty Murray (D-WA), who held up the confirmation of a new FDA head until they stopped dragging their feet over this approval. Now, letâs get RU-486 approved too</span>
