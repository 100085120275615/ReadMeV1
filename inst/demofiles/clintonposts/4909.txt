<p>You know things are bad in the world when David Hasselhoff, aka &#8220;The Hoff,&#8221; can&#8217;t get no respect from the press. The Hoff has received a lot of bad PR lately regarding some public drunken appearances.  <a title="Anorak: Hoff Centre" href="http://www.anorak.co.uk/features.php?features_id=170082">This episode in particular</a> is my favorite - the press claims The Hoff is kicked out of Wimbledon for being totally drunk.   As he is evicted from the premises he shouts out:</p>

<blockquote><p>You should let me in.  Do you know who I am? I am the Hoff.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong><em>I AM THE HOFF!</em></strong></p>

<p>Now here he is on July 24 <a title="Yahoo News: " href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060724/ap_en_tv/people_hasselhoff">denying the incident</a>, stressing that he absolutely does not drink and that the press will report any lie they can come up with.  However, three days later we&#8217;ve got another <a title="Telegraph News: Teh Hoff Drunk in Airport!" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/07/27/uhass.xml">awesome Hoff incident</a>, where he gets so drunk in the airport, British Airways wouldn&#8217;t let him board the plane.  I commend the travel stewards on prohibiting him from the flight - what happens if the Hoff starts taking off his shirt and singing songs by Chef in the middle of the airplane?  There&#8217;s nowhere ladies and gay men can go to escape the power of The Hoff.</p>

<p>The shirtless Hoff - causing as much ruckus as snakes on a plane?  <strong>You decide.</strong>  <em>dun dun duuun&#8230;</em></p>

<p><a id="more-381"></a>President Bush vetoed a bill on stem cell research, inciting the anger of many across the country.  The Democratic party was quick to respond with the following message: <a title="Fox News: Democratic Response to President's Radio Address" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,205197,00.html">Bush hates people</a>.</p>

<p>However, the human race won&#8217;t totally be left without advancements as further technological developments are allowing <a title="National Geographic: Man Moves Objects with his Mind Using New Sensor" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060712-brain-move.html">people to move objects with their minds</a>.</p>

<blockquote>The experiments show that it is possible to capture the language of the brain, reroute that language outside the brain, and then decode the signals into movement commands, according to researchers.

&#8220;We&#8217;re just at the start, just getting off the ground,&#8221; study co-author John Donoghue said.</blockquote>

<p>To date, four patients have received the implant, called &#8220;BrainGate.&#8221;  This is expected to be available on the market in 2008.  Consumers hope future developments of BrainGate will allow them to control robotic arms and surf porn.</p>

<p>Miss Puerto Rico was crowned Miss Universe!  In the heat, strain, excitement, and malnourishment, she fainted.  <a title="Reuters: Miss Puerto Rico Crowned Miss Universe, Collapses" href="http://today.reuters.com/news/NewsArticle.aspx?type=entertainmentNews&amp;storyID=2006-07-24T101326Z_01_N23308168_RTRUKOC_0_US-LEISURE-MISSUNIVERSE.xml&amp;src=072406_0804_ARTICLE_PROMO_also_on_reuters">The article</a> gives many great details - that she fainted exactly at 8:38pm, an announcer who was not identified called for a nurse (I&#8217;m surprised they tried to find out this person&#8217;s name) - some super-sleuth intern writer who was given this dumb story really went wild on all of the really important (har) details, but failed to mention when the stupid pageant actually took place.  Better luck next time, intern!</p>

<p>There are so many news reports that it&#8217;s hard to verify which ones are accurate and which ones were not.  Previously there were reports that Saddam Hussein went on a hunger strike which lasted a single meal.  A new report has come out that Saddam and his &#8220;people&#8221; have gone on another hunger strike, which put Saddam in the hospital to be fed via I.V.  His trial is nearing an end, and <a title="LA Times: Saddam Hussein Rails Against Defense as Trial Nears End" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-fg-saddam27jul27,1,4145193.story?coll=la-news-a_section&amp;ctrack=1&amp;cset=true">according to reports</a>, he&#8217;s still in fine form.</p>

<blockquote>The unidentified attorney, his voice digitally disguised, continued reading from a final defense statement that ran 75 pages.

&#8220;I don&#8217;t want my history to be stained by this,&#8221; Hussein interrupted.</blockquote>

<p>Please do not stain his history with the facts, people! Nobody likes it when that happens.  Hussein has demanded that he receive death by firing squad, however that is the death given to soldiers, which Saddam Hussein is not.</p>

<p>A thousand year old <a title="National Geographic: Book Discovered in Ireland Bog" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060726-ireland-psalms_2.html">book of Psalms was discovered in a bog in Ireland</a>.  Strangely enough, the book was found open to Psalm 83 - a passage where the psalmist complains to God that all the surrounding nations are conspiring against Israel, and begs God to persecute them for all of the trouble they have been bringing on Israel, God&#8217;s chosen people.  &#8220;Experts&#8221; (expert in what, the article doesn&#8217;t say) focused mainly on the page left open, because it could mean something about the current conflict in Israel.  Apparently, these &#8220;experts&#8221; aren&#8217;t aware that Israel was bombed because it was Tuesday.  And Wednesday.  Don&#8217;t forget Thursday.  Or Friday.  At any rate, after what I am sure was <em>exhaustive research</em> on the page, they decided that no, the <a title="National Geographic" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060727-book-psalms.html">Newfound Book of Psalms Doesn&#8217;t Predict Doom</a>.  Thank God for that, because <strong>I WAS SO WORRIED</strong>.  In fact I was about to tell you to stock up on bottled water and canned food, like it was Y2K.  Good thing we have experts to tell us these things.</p>

Seeing as how the only memorable N&#8217;Sync member is <a title="Justin Timberlake" href="http://www.justintimberlake.com/">Justin Timberlake</a> (and the only reason for that is because he was banging Britney Spears back before she had come out into the open as hideous, zit-covered, cheeto-binging, baby-dropping trailer trash) the article helps you understand which member we&#8217;re talking about (numbers added are mine).</p>

<blockquote>
<ol>

<p>Gay previous N&#8217;Sync&#8217;er who tried hard to be an astronaut but failed miserably and publically&#8230; I don&#8217;t know about you, but I&#8217;m not seeing a bright future for Lance.  Well, his star may be falling, but the dream of going to the moon may not - <a title="National Geographic: NASA Ains to Open Moon for Business" href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/07/060725-moon-money.html">NASA Aims to Open the Moon for Business</a>.  The Space Frontier Foundation, a Nyack, New York-based space-advocacy organization, believes that the future of mankind is to create human settlements on other planets.  I support where this organization is trying to take the human race, and I would be all for helping Lance Bass become involved so he can realize his dream.  Also because I would love to rocket all boy banders into space.  Think about it, people.</p>

<p>President Bush is in trouble again.  The American Bar Association has issued a report regarding excessive use (abuse) of &#8220;signing statements&#8221;.

The article contains a link to the ABA statement.

What is it with snakes and post office workers lately?   A postal worker said the package began to move around and then she saw a snake coming out.</p>

<blockquote>One of the postal workers in the western city of Mechernich, who was familiar with snakes, wrestled with it and locked it into another container, while her colleagues ran away.</blockquote>

<p>I would have run over co-workers, shoving them backwards in the direction of the snake to get out of there.  But that&#8217;s just me.</p>

Six people and a dog were killed brutally with bats (some stab wounds were also found) and the bats were ditched in a pond.  The three men will receive the death penalty.  <strong>GOOD.</strong></p>

<p>Andrea Yates, the mother who drowned her five children, one by one, in a bathtub, <a title="CNN: Yates Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity" href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/07/26/yates.trial.ap/index.html">was found not guilty by reason of insanity</a>.  Yates claims she heard Satan inside her and was trying to save her children from hell.  So now she&#8217;s not guilty because she&#8217;s insane.  You know, I have to say that this is one of the reasons I believe that there is an afterlife.  And I believe that one day Andrea Yates will get what&#8217;s coming to her.  It may not be today, or tomorrow, or in a year from now - but I hope and pray that she will suffer for all eternity for what she has done.  Someday, she will receive justice - true justice, not what has happened in that court - for what she&#8217;s done.</p>

<p>My thoughts exactly, Mr. Deloit.</p>
