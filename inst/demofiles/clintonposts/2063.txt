<br />I rarely break my schedule for news in the sculpture world and almost never cover museum exhibit stories, but this one was too good to pass up. <br />
<br />Seems as how my good old pal Daniel Edwards, the fellow who gave us "Brittany giving Birth", has followed up that piece of timeless art with a new one- a bust of Hillary Clinto nude to be displayed at New York's Museum of Sex. <br />
<br />As usual, the prurient smoothie has only the nobelest of intentions.. He says he wants to stimulate conversations about politics, sex, and celebrity. He says that Clinton covers herself up too much and needs to expose her feminity more to the public. <br />
<br />That's not the only cover up going on around here!</div>
