<br />
<br />A Chinese company is honoring ex-president Bill Clinton by naming a new line of condoms after him - along with a companion line of condoms that will be named after his ex-girlfriend, Monica Lewinsky.
<br />
<br />Reports Britian's Sky News: The Guangzhou Haokian Bio-science company has registered their names as trademarks for the contraceptives.
<br />
<br />The condoms will display Chinese spellings: Kelitun and Laiwensiji.
<br />
<br />A 12-pack of Clintons is expected to cost $5.00, with Lewinskys selling at a discounted price of just over $3.00.
<br />
<br />The manufacturer's general manager, Liu Wenhua, told Sky News that naming his condoms for Clinton was perfectly legal, explaining that "trademarks of two foreign surnames and can't be seen as a violation of rights."
<br />
<br />Clinton is the only U.S. president to be honored with his own condom brand line. New York Sen. Hillary Clinton was unavailable to comment on her husband's latest achievement.</div>
