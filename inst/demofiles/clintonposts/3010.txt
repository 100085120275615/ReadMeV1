<div>Dubai started to think in a way that will help her to enhance and improve the relations between Dubaiâs government and British government. What Dubai did was something unique, it proposed to bay some main ports in England. Dubai faced huge movements against it, many people argued about the social and political issues and that the British government should keep its control over the ports instead of putting that control in the hand of Dubaiâs government. In a while, all these social and political organizations that raised some non market issues gave their support to the British government. The government did some successful arrangements with these institutions and declared its agreement. On the other hand, Dubai and after finishing a successful deal in Europe, it went to the United States and started to offer to bay six major ports in the American land. What happened was something new to the Americans, Dubai should get the White Houseâs support to finish the deal, but this support will not be enough to close the deal. Particularly, this ports industry is shaped by many elements, and the agreement of the White House is not enough and Dubai should try harder to get the Congress support. Dubai got the Bush Administrationâs agreement which considered a one step forward, but Senator Hillary Clinton started a strong and huge campaign against the deal in the Congress. She argued that giving a stranger the control over our ports will affect the United Statesâ national security. Many others think that the authorities in the United States will not ignore this side and will provide a full protection to these ports and Dubai will be only responsible of the financial aspects of the harbors. Others think that what Hillary Clinton is doing is just an advertisement campaign to her since she is planning to run for the presidential election. The situation is still very complicated and the deal is waiting to be closed, and Dubai government should try harder to get the deal.</div>
