<span>For as long as I can remember, I have been haunted by the following three questions:<br />
<br />1) âIs âanal-retentiveâ supposed to be hyphenated?â<br />
<br />2) âWhat if the Hokey-Pokey really <em>is</em> what itâs all about?â<br />
<br />and,<br />
<br />3) âJust who are these culturally imperialistic + insular/evangelical + sectarian/protestant + knee-jerk/conservative + concrete/prosaic + hermeneutically/insensitive + blah/blah/blah + yadda/yadda/yadda + prefabricated CHRISTIANS that Brian McLaren has labored so hard to warn us about?â<br />
<br />Okay, so I havenât been thinking about the third question for quite as long as the first two, but that doesnât diminish the threat of imminent catastrophe these people bring to western civilization, which, as we all know, will reduce each and every one of us to Amway distributors. But in the (admittedly small) circles in which I travel, actually encountering one of these people seemed about as likely as an American G.I. triggering a nuclear holocaust by accidentally putting out a cigarette on one of Sadaam Husseinâs hidden A-bombs. They had apparently all masterfully blended in with the legitimate population.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Until now.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Actually, it was several months ago. I had come to the conclusion that I didnât get out enough, and had fallen completely out-of-touch with what my fellow church goers do when theyâre not in church. So when for the first time in my life I was able to attend the annual âRebuking Your Mindâ conference, hosted by D.C. Scrolls, I just had to see what it was like. It wasnât the same as joining the church bowling league, but it would have to do for the time being.<br />
<br />It wasnât cheap, and I didnât get a very good deal on the airfare, but a friend at my church put me in touch with a guy in that area who was also attending the conference and had a spare room, so that made it affordable. His name was Cary, and when I called he agreed to pick me up at the airport.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>It was a dark and rainy night. At least when I departed it was. When I arrived at my destination it was just dark. I called Cary on his cell and he met me outside. As soon as we got into his car its speakers started blaring some talk-radio program called âBarbarous Nation,â hosted by a hypertension-inducing ultra-right-winger whose actual name really <em>is</em> Joe Barbarous. Cary appeared to enjoy the program, but he thankfully turned the volume down as Joe launched into a loud, dyspeptic rant about moderate Republicans, âIslamo-Nazis,â and the haircut on his neighborâs poodle. This allowed us to start making the customary small talk as we headed into the city, which was awkward at best because Cary struck me as a little odd from the get-go.<br />
<br />âIâm really looking forward to this conference,â I told him.<br />
<br />âWellââ his voice lingered a bit, and then: âI wish I could say the same.â<br />
<br />âWhyâs that?â<br />
<br />âItâs just the theme they chose this year.â<br />
<br />âApologetics?â I said, âThatâs one of the things that attracted me to it.â<br />
<br />âYeah, well I think the whole enterprise is entirely wrong-headed,â said Cary.<br />
<br />âThen how do you go about answering non-believersâ questions?â I asked.<br />
<br />âTell âem they shouldnât be asking such questions in the <em>first</em> place!â he retorted, already getting a little heated so soon in our conversation. âThe Bible is the ultimate authority! Like it or lump it!â<br />
<br />âHmm,â I observed, already beginning to experience dÃ©jÃ  vu. That seemed to settle that!</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>After about 20 minutes he suddenly pulled the car over up to the curb in the middle of a block, shifted into park, and turned off the engine. The street was deserted and quiet, and probably for good reason. I personally interpreted the gang graffiti spray-painted on the brick wall near the car as the equivalent of the local surgeon generalâs warning to not hang around too long.<br />
<br />âThis will take just a second,â he said, opening his car door.<br />
<br />âCan I help you with anything?â I asked.<br />
<br />âIâll be right back.â<br />
<br />After the door shut behind him I listened to the sound of his shoes hitting the sidewalk and echoing off the buildings. My eyes followed him as he approached a man I just then noticed standing under the corner streetlight, and who occasionally looked over his shoulder during his brief chat with Cary. After exchanging a few words the man handed him something in a brown paper bag. As he opened his car door upon his return he tossed it into my lap with a grin.<br />
<br />âWhatâs this?â I asked, feeling more than a little leery.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6913/1833/320/WhaChooTalkinBoutWillis.jpg">

</span>

<br />
<br />âTake a look,â he said, turning the ignition, shifting into drive and pulling away.<br />
<br />So I turned the bag upside down and out slid a book titled, <em>Yo! JC2!,</em> and subtitled<em> Chillaxinâ wit My Homey Calvin.</em> It seemed to be some sort of on-the-street version of Calvinism. As I paged through its chessboard diagrams showing God arbitrarily knocking some of the pieces off the board into a fiery furnace labeled âHellâ I was tempted to remark on how different this was from the version of Calvinism Iâd heard on D.C. Scrollsâ tapes, but a little voice in my head urged caution.</span>
<br />
<span>
<br />âSo, uhâwhat church do you attend?â I asked while turning the pages.<br />
<br />âWell, for the last few years Iâve been going to the Church of the Absolute Foundation,â he said, âbut Iâm thinking of switching to Bucketseat Canyon Community Church.â<br />
<br />âWhyâs that?â<br />
<br />âWell, I like Absolute Foundationâs emphasis on personal salvation,â he said, âbut after a while it didnât seem centered enough on my needs. So I figure itâs time to trade up.â<br />
<br />âTrade up?â I queried.<br />
<br />âYeah. Find a church that that provides better goods and services,â he replied. âBesides, I always felt a little duped by all the emphasis at Absolute on evangelism and missions. I mean, like, whatâs in that for me?â<br />
<br />I still hadnât figured out why Caryâs opinions sounded so strangely familiar. I was a little preoccupied over concerns about his possible military assault weapon collection. So I pretended to continue paging through the book, but out of the corner of my eye I was checking to see if Tom Bodett had left the light on for me at the local Motel 6.<br />
<br />Itâs not that I hadnât already come across my share of oddballs in my evangelical wanderings. How can I forget Bill, who felt the constant need to interject his insights from a huge copy of the Septuagint he carried to our Bible studies after taking a semester of Greek? Or Nick and his traveling model Tabernacle show that took up half the church auditorium, and actually looked pretty cool, but unfortunately was accompanied by his nearly-incoherent, meandering, 40-minute messages in which he managed to find profound spiritual insights in virtually every color of thread in the Old Testament Tabernacleâs fabric? Or Angelo, who took a part-time job in a local parking garage while attending Bible school, and when the lines got long and people leaned on their horns because he was explaining the Four Spiritual Laws to the guy parked at the gate, heâd cup his hands and yell, âHey! Canât you see Iâm trying to witness to this guy?!â (These stories are all true. Hmm. I wonder if I should have changed the names?)</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>I tried to stay off topics that might set Cary off. I went down a mental checklist that seemed to suggest itself to me: âRoman Catholicism?â I thought, âScratch that! The writings of Karl Barth? Better not. Hillary Clinton? Uh, I havenât paid this monthâs life insurance premium yetâ¦â So I decided the best course was simply to let him take the initiative in the conversation, which he was more than happy to do.<br />
<br />âAnd where do people get off with all this sissy hermeneutics baloney?â he demanded as we were pulling up his driveway. âJust pick up the Bible and read it! Take the book of Hosea: boy finds girl / boy loses girl / girl turns up on flea market clearance rack. What more do you need to know?â<br />
<br />He popped the trunk, we got out, and as I wheeled my suitcase into his house and passed his kitchen table I spotted a piece of mail showing his full name, Cary K. Chure, which I knew would come in handy if I needed to call 911. He pointed me upstairs to my room and invited me to come back down to his den for some coffee. When I got up there I checked under the bed to make sure there were no alien pods under it. After a few minutes I came back down and we walked into the den together.<br />
<br />And then I saw it.<br />
<br />It caught me totally by surprise. Of course, Iâd read about it in <em>A Generous Orthodoxy,</em> but it didnât look anything like I thought it would.<br />
<br />But there it was: captured, stuffed, and mounted on the wall. I struggled to find words as I stood transfixed before it in disbelief.<br />
<br />âThatâsâ! <em>Thatâsâ!</em>â I slowly lifted my arm to point at the nameplate at the bottom of the huge wooden plaque on which it was mounted.<br />
<br />âYep!â he said proudly, laying a gentle, avuncular hand on my shoulder. âThatâs <em>âTruth!ââ</em>
<br />
<br />I turned to him in wide-eyed incredulity.<br />
<br />âSo <em>youâre</em> the one McLaren was writing about!â<br />
<br />He just smiled and reached into a drawer to pull something out and thrust into my hands.<br />
<br />âHere yaâ go: one to take home!â<br />
<br />It was a nailed-down, freeze-dried, shrink-wrapped version of what was on the wall.</span>
