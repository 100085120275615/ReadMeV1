<p>Neal Boortz puts up a <a href="http://boortz.com/nuze/200608/08282006.html">list</a> of reasons why you shouldn&#8217;t vote for anyone in the fall.</p>
<blockquote><p><font color="#ff0000"><u><strong>Why you shouldn&#8217;t vote Republican</strong></u></font></p>
<p>They have absolutely no fiscal discipline whatsoever.    No congress has ever blown money on vote-buying programs quite like the    current Republican congress has.</p>
<p>There are far too many Republicans who want to take    their personal religious blueprints for behavior and make them law.</p>
<p>The seem unwilling to press the advantage when it is    theirs to press.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re prudes.</p>
<p>Stem cell research.</p>
<p>Donald Wildmon</p>
<p>The McCain-Feingold Campaign Reform Act.</p>
<p>Democrats think that it&#8217;s odd that the jails are so    full while our crime rate is going down.</p>
<p>The Medicare Prescription Drug benefit for the Gimme    Generation</p>
<p>If they had their way, Terri Schiavo&#8217;s soul would still    not be at rest.</p>
<p>They pay more attention to K Street than they do to the    American workers and businessmen carrying the load.</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t even protect America&#8217;s borders.</p>
<p>Do you want your kids to come home from a government    school and tell you that the Earth is only 6000 years old?</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><u><strong>Why you shouldn&#8217;t vote Democrat</strong></u></font></p>
<p>They clearly will not defend America from Islamic    Fascism &#8230; not now &#8230; not until the price of that defense is catastrophic.</p>
<p>They think terrorism is a law enforcement problem.</p>
<p>Their war against individualism.</p>
<p>They think America is great because of its government.</p>
<p>They seem to think that income is distributed, not    earned.</p>
<p>They promote class warfare.</p>
<p>They have almost single-handedly destroyed black    culture in America.</p>
<p>Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re joined at the hip with teacher&#8217;s unions.</p>
<p>Taxes can never be too high for Democrats.</p>
<p>They fully intend to destroy talk radio.</p>
<p>Their love of mob rule.</p>
<p>The fully intend to turn illegal aliens into Democrat    voters.</p>
<p>Like the Republicans; they refuse to protect America&#8217;s    borders</p>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><u><strong>Why your shouldn&#8217;t vote Libertarian</strong></u></font></p>
<p>With over 50% of the American people harboring strong    libertarian feelings, they can&#8217;t manage to mount a viable third-party    campaign.  How would they manage to govern?</p>
<p>Not only will they not defend America&#8217;s borders, they    don&#8217;t really think the borders need defending.</p>
<p>Though philosophically they&#8217;re right, they fail to see    that their &#8220;legalize drugs&#8221; agenda isn&#8217;t exactly a winner with the American    people.</p>
<p>They never jumped on eminent domain abuse as the party    agenda.  People will react when they think their property rights are    being threatened &#8230;. and the Libertarians couldn&#8217;t take advantage of this.</p>
<p>Have you seen the way some of the people at their    convention dress?</p></blockquote>
<p>While I don&#8217;t agree with all the reasons given, I&#8217;d agree completely with the result except for the fact that someone has to win even if they get only 1/2% of the electorate to vote for them as long as the other guy only gets 0.499%. I&#8217;ve always wanted to amend the Constitution to require that someone actually get more than 50% of the eligible electorate to vote for them or otherwise the office would be vacated until the next election. That would certainly reduce government pretty quickly. <img src="http://commonsensewonder.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
