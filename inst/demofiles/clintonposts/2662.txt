<div><p><strong><em>Barry Goldwater - Liberal</em></strong></p>

<p>Think of it as secular <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003053350">blasphemy</a>.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>An interview in this Sunday's New York Times Magazine with C.C. Goldwater reveals that her HBO film to be aired Sept. 18 paints her late grandfather, Sen. Barry Goldwater, &quot;as a kind of liberal,&quot; with testimonials from Al Franken, Sen. Ted Kennedy, James Carville and Sen. Hillary Clinton.<br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />In fact, Hillary campaigned for Goldwater in 1964 in his race for president against Lyndon Johnson. &quot;Hillary was a Goldwater girl,&quot; says the filmmaker, interviewed by Deborah Solomon. &quot;She passed out cookies and lemonade at his campaign functions.&quot; <br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />Solomon calls Goldwater &quot;a half-Jewish cowboy from Phoenix.&quot; <br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />The film -- made on a budget of $800,000 -- will note that the straight-talking Sen. Goldwater, author of the classic &quot;The Conscience of a Conservative&quot; (soon to be reissued by Princeton University Press) favored abortion rights and allowing gays in the military, and refused to attend President Nixon's funeral because he &quot;cheated&quot; the country. <br clear="none" /><br clear="none" />In the film, former Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradlee calls Sen. Goldwater &quot;an unsung hero of Watergate&quot; for helping convince Nixon to resign. </p></blockquote><p>The image of Hillary passing out cookies and lemonade is of course irresistible.&nbsp; If a framed photograph is for sale I'd certainly consider buying.&nbsp; What the Leftists quoted miss, or indeed want to miss, is that Goldwater was rather more libertarian in his thinking than most conservatives at the time, indeed considerably more so than even the Gipper.&nbsp; His stands on abortion and gay rights reflected his belief in individual freedom; over and above traditional and religious restrictions on those freedoms.&nbsp; The liberal eagerness to testify to the virtues and values of the late Senator has more than a little to do with capturing a bit of his reflected glory; while undermining a key part of the conservative historical narrative.&nbsp; The 1964 presidential campaign was, with the exception of 1932, the most seminal of the 20th century.&nbsp; Johnson's victory granted the Democrats the mandate to establish the Great Society.&nbsp; Goldwater's defeat created a martyr and a mass movement.&nbsp; The Republican welfare reforms of the mid-1990s acted as a kind book end to the Great Society.&nbsp; The welfare state certainly remains but the crusading zeal was dead by the time the Contract with America came to prominence.&nbsp; The Conservative Ascendancy that has kept the Democrats out of office for most of the last quarter century began with the Goldwater defeat.&nbsp; Co-opting the movement's first great hero to the Left would be one hell of a coup.&nbsp; The Democrats have for decades delighted in pointing at the Republicans and saying: &quot;This is the party of Lincoln?&quot;&nbsp; This is simply an extension of that principle. In fairness some Republicans have attempted much the same thing with FDR and JFK.&nbsp; Stealing icons has a long bipartisan tradition.</p>

<p>New Brunswick?&nbsp; The Lord, and The Carbuncle, work in <a href="http://thecarbuncle.blogspot.com/2006/08/in-which-i-bring-peace-to-middle-east.html">mysterious</a> ways.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><div align="justify">Listen. 80% of New Brunswick is forest. Thatâs about 56,000 square kilometers. Israel is only tiny â about 20,000 sq kms. I propose that we move Israel to safer environs. Weâll sell the Israelis, oh, say 30,000 sq kms., including a bit of coastline. They can pick â Atlantic or Fundy. The rest of the world can be good sports, in the interest of peace and what not, and kick in some or all of the purchase price. The Americans got a third of their country from the French for about $400,000,000,000. That seems a bit of a bargain for such a huge swath of the Midwest and the Mississippi River Valley, but itâs probably about right for half of New Brunswick. Sold! <p>The Israelis can dismantle whatever cultural landmarks they feel are indispensable and move them lock stock and barrel over here. Christians could ante up to move some of the Biblical stuff if they wanted to. Golgotha, the Sepulchre and what have you. It would be the greatest engineering feat in history. Think of the jobs that would be created. Think of how few Hezbollah are operating on the Maine border. Give âPalestineâ back to the Arabs. Bring Israeli money, know how, determination over here. A fresh start. No more being blamed for all the problems in the Arab world. No more rockets falling on kibbutzes. Iâm not sure what the Arabs would do with themselves without the Jews to kick around. When all else fails, I suppose they can blame America. </p></div></blockquote><p dir="ltr">It seems unlikely that the Jewish people will again want to wander in the wilderness, especially such a cold and remote wilderness.&nbsp; Certainly the Martimes could use the boost, anyone who can make the desert bloom and defeat three Arab armies in less than a week might have a chance of economically reviving N.B.&nbsp; Maybe even the Bricklin.&nbsp; </p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><em>Liberal Birth Control</em></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">The American Left goes the way of the European <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110008831">mainstream</a>.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>But the data on young Americans tell a different story. Simply put, liberals have a big baby problem: They're not having enough of them, they haven't for a long time, and their pool of potential new voters is suffering as a result. According to the 2004 General Social Survey, if you picked 100 unrelated politically liberal adults at random, you would find that they had, between them, 147 children. If you picked 100 conservatives, you would find 208 kids. That's a &quot;fertility gap&quot; of 41%. Given that about 80% of people with an identifiable party preference grow up to vote the same way as their parents, this gap translates into lots more little Republicans than little Democrats to vote in future elections. Over the past 30 years this gap has not been below 20%--explaining, to a large extent, the current ineffectiveness of liberal youth voter campaigns today.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Leaving aside the argument that conservatives are all literalistic Bible Belt Christians who are following the injunction of Genesis to go forth and so forth, which most aren't, the reproductive gap more likely reveals a cultural difference.&nbsp; As the article goes onto say:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">The fertility gap doesn't budge when we correct for factors like age, income, education, sex, race--or even religion. Indeed, if a conservative and a liberal are identical in all these ways, the liberal will still be 19 percentage points more likely to be childless than the conservative. </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">So what kind of cultural difference are we talking about?</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">As one liberal columnist in a major paper graphically put it, &quot;Maybe the scales are tipping to the neoconservative, homogeneous right in our culture simply because they tend not to give much of a damn for the ramifications of wanton breeding and environmental destruction and pious sanctimony, whereas those on the left actually seem to give a whit for the health of the planet and the dire effects of overpopulation.&quot; </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">In other words the baby gap is a view of man and the world gap.&nbsp; The Left's view of man is of a craven, cowardly creature - a Freudian caricature and a pestilence upon the earth.&nbsp; The Right's view of man is entirely opposite.&nbsp; Human beings are rational, if they want to be, the world is knowable and anything is possible if you try and luck isn't completely against you.&nbsp; As for Mother Earth?&nbsp; Nature is nice, so are sub-divisions.&nbsp; I can't recall which Reagan cabinet member once outraged the environmental movement by saying that he thought off-shore oil platforms were beautiful, but he eloquently expressed the Right's view of environmentalism.&nbsp; Even those nasty Christians, believing in original sin and all that, still have a more positive view of human nature.&nbsp; Christ called for loving the sinner and hating the sin, then proceeded to sacrifice himself on exactly that point.&nbsp; The Left doesn't believe in being saved.&nbsp; Man is a wretch without the possibility of salvation.&nbsp; Suicide, then, is the logical outcome.&nbsp; </p>

<p dir="ltr">Too often those on the Right, I'm thinking here in particular of the Steyn, explain the demographic collapse of the West, which is really the collapse of the Left, as a product of extreme decadence.&nbsp; Career women wanting one designer baby at 40, too selfish and self indulgent to accept the rigors and responsibilities of child rearing.&nbsp; Narcissism approaching and creating a literal null.&nbsp; I'd suspect if you looked closely at the vital statistics, over the last forty years, you'd see a significant drop in children per women for both conservatives and liberals.&nbsp; The drop for liberals would probably be far greater; driven by the number of liberal women choosing not to have any children at all.&nbsp; If life is without value, or a succession of meaningless &quot;kicks,&quot;&nbsp; then carrying unto the last generation is beside the point.</p>

<p dir="ltr"><strong><em>At the Creation</em></strong></p>

<p dir="ltr">Paul Tuns quotes this quick sketch of the history of <a href="http://www.soberingthoughts.blogspot.com/2006_08_01_soberingthoughts_archive.html#115644460396185096">American Conservatism</a> since 1955.</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">&quot;Back in the late 1950s, most of the conservative movement could and did meet for lunch in the company dining room of Bill Buckley's family oil business on East 37th St. in Manhattan. They were devout Cold Warriors and, in domestic affairs, were generally opposed to the steady growth of government. On both counts, they opposed the policies of the liberals, who ran the country. They called themselves, simply, &quot;conservatives.&quot; No one rose to protest the term.<br /><br />From the start, the conservatives recognized the existence of a group of country cousins who called themselves &quot;libertarians.&quot; The libertarians had been around for a while. Their big obsession was government, which they wanted to keep as small as possible. The conservatives had considerable sympathy for this view, but thought there was more to conservatism than just that. Moreover, the libertarians' antagonism to government action kept them from endorsing wholeheartedly government measures needed to win the Cold War.<br /><br />Things rocked along this way until the mid-1960s, when a small but influential group of liberals and leftists -- mostly New Yorkers -- got fed up with liberal acquiescence in the antics of the noisy New Left (especially in opposing the Cold War) and broke with liberalism altogether. This group, led by Irving Kristol and Norman Podhoretz, long resisted being called conservatives, but eventually agreed to be described as &quot;neoconservatives.&quot;</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Be sure to read Paul's comments.&nbsp; I disagree with him somewhat that the differences between conservatives are a matter of priority.&nbsp; There is something more fundamental going on.&nbsp; Can we really explain the differences between, say, Pat Buchannan and Paul Wolfowitz as a matter of emphasis?&nbsp; I do very much agree with the below:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p dir="ltr">It is telling that &quot;conservatives&quot; of whatever strain seldom shy from using the term conservative (unless they are true libertarians). That conservatism continues to find thoughtful advocates why liberalism (however you want to define that, and probably best modified by &quot;political&quot; or &quot;modern&quot;) doesn't. And, of course, few liberals are willing to use the label on themselves or describe what they believe in.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Why are liberals so timid?&nbsp; Because they feel guilty and defensive.&nbsp; Their assumptions no longer go unquestioned in the public square.&nbsp; They have also become, dare we use the word, reactionaries.&nbsp; Like the patricians they once opposed, they don't know why they believe what they believe.&nbsp; That makes them very vulnerable and consequently very nervous.&nbsp; On a side note, I recently watched part of the 1972 Robert Redford satire <em><a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0068334/">The Candidate</a></em>.&nbsp; Near the beginning the idealistic liberal, played of course by Redford, is watching his conservative opponent give a stump speech.&nbsp; The speech is intended to be a perfect cliche of traditional American conservative values; the words freedom and hard work finding themselves in about every other sentence.&nbsp; The uncanny bit is that more than thirty years after the fact the speech remains far more fresh than anything Redford says in the entire picture.</p>

<p class="story2" dir="ltr">The economics of <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2148329/nav/tap2/">IMAX</a></p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p>Edutainment funded by <span>Lockheed Martin</span> doesn't sound like box-office gold, but <em>The Dream Is Alive</em> is the top-grossing movie in IMAX history. It has earned more than $150 million since its 1985 debut, putting it several million dollars ahead of such competitors as 1998's <em><span>Everest</span></em> and 1991's <em><span>Antarctica</span></em>. Yet for all its success with such films, the IMAX Corp<span>.</span> dislikes being thought of as a purveyor of mega-sized documentaries. It now wants to show Hollywood blockbusters on its trademark six-story screensâa strategic shift that seems to have caused the company considerable trouble. </p>

<p><em>The Dream Is Alive</em> became an IMAX evergreen in large part because its subject matter has always been topical, especially for grade-schoolers on field trips. The consistent news coverage afforded the space shuttle program has doubled as free publicity for the movie. Although a rival IMAX presentation like <em>Everest</em> might enjoy an uptick in interest during an unusually lethal year for mountain climbers, such stories tend to come and go. </p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><strong><em>Chaucer Blogs</em></strong></p>
