<br />Before I forget, almost all of the black and white photos published on this blog were taken by the egregiously effulgent Sharla, my hi-rez, hi-def fetish Mama.  She has produced many delicious photos (she's got that 'eye'), and excels as a paint and canvas artist.  Excellence is her salient feature (along with firm,profulgent mammai):  excellent lover, excellent conversationalist, excellent planner.<br />
<br />Bill Liversidge, over at The View From The Pundy House blogsite, received one of those insidious, soul-eating, confidence-sucking rejection letters from MacMillan New Writer.  Nothing worse, I know, because I've been graced with many myself, enough so that I am the VP of the Rejected and Despondent Writers With Bad Attitudes Club, LLC; the president is Gerard Jones, the Everyone Who's Anyone Guy, author of Ginny Good, one of the great books of this or any century, who estimates he has received around 150,000 rejections.  He is, indubitably, the most rejected writer ever.  An astounding accomplishment, and one, in my opinion, that just goes to show ya' that literary myopia is prevalent, even pandemic.<br />
<br />Henry Baum signed with The Literary Group, where he now rubs shoulders with such revered goddesses as Jessica Simpson and Brittany Spears.  Definitely hi-rez-now-we're-living-kind-of-stuff.  POD doesn't look so grim anymore, does it?<br />
<br />I propose the following:  ten or fifteen of us align ourselves, form a publishing company, each donate a thousand dollars to the enterprise, and go for it.<br />
<br />I haven't heard from Ephemera-Bound publishers, or Velluminous and Elspeth Fahey.<br />Dr. Blogstein likes The Sound of Meat, thinks it should be published by a traditional paper-from-trees outfit.  So does David Brown of Simon and Schuster.  So does my ex-wife.  So does Sharla.  Now, where's that Uberagent in the slick Armani suit?  I'm rough and ready, ready to sign a contract.<br />
<br />I'm performing research (sounds kind of kinky doesn' it?) for (Dis)Organization, and surfing away at Snitch.  Hillary Carlip at Fresh Yarn has accepted my essayistic elegy of the same name (Snitch, version 1.0).</div>
