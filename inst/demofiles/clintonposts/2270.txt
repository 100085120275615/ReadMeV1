<br />Just in case you're thinking that my prior post on Sen. Bayh was either myself or the writers in the links taking things out of context, here in its' entirety is the speech as given by this azzwipe. <p></p>
<p>My comments can be read in brackets [ ]. Just for the frack of it, I'm also highlighting his quote "Middle Class" in red so we can see how many times he's going to repeat it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Senator Evan Bayh<br />
<a href="http://www.allamericapac.com/middleclass" rel="news and politics">Speech to the National Press Club </a>
<br />Washington, DC<br />July 17, 2006<br />As Prepared for Delivery<br />
<br />âI come before you to speak about the future of America and our <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>.</strong> The two have been inextricably linked throughout our history. <strong>[Note: nothing is said about our country having been built and the great majority of our citizens being at the poverty level, guess they and we don't count. Strike that, Bayh says we don't matter.]</strong>
<br />
<br />I also speak about the future of the Democratic Party, my Party, the Party historically committed to a strong, growing <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span>, a commitment too many voters now question. <strong>[Of course, nothing's said here about the Democratic Party acting like sociopathic obsessive psychopaths in their rabid screaming against anyone who's a Republican and special hatred extended toward President Bush.]/strong&gt;<br />
<br />
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> Americans know that President Bush and his Administration represent the privileged. They know that Democrats stand for those less fortunate, and proudly so. They look to Washington and see a government absorbed in self-interest. Who speaks for them, those neither rich nor poor? Too often, their answer is âno one.â<strong> [Less fortunate? What the frack does that mean when this idjut is saying the "less fortunate" are Middle Class? Guess that means that anyone whose income doesn't reach that bracket is SOL as far as he and the DemoncRATS are concerned.]<br />
<br />
</strong>For the future of our nation and the future of my Party, that must change. If this President will not speak for our <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span>, I will. And if Democrats want to lead this nation, we must.<strong> [Yep, he's on the Middle Class bandwagon and frag everyone else. Of course, in this butt munchs' way of thinking the only ones worth anything are DhimmicRATs and the Middle Class.]<br />
<br />
</strong>As Democrats and Americans, we must build an âOpportunity Societyâ to strengthen our <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span>. We must confront the challenges <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> Americans face â health care costs, college affordability, retirement security and more â so that all can build lives of greater prosperity and promise. And we must reward hard work, thrift and ingenuity so that all who aspire to it can join the <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span>. <strong>[Let's make sure I'm getting this right. The only ones who count in Bayh's "mind" are dhimmicRATs and the Middle Class.]<br />
<br />
</strong>This must be the work of our generation.<strong> [What about making it so our low level income population has a chance for college affordability and frack former Taliban students from entering our Ivy League universities?]<br />
<br />
</strong>This not been the work of President Bush and this Administration.<br />
<br />For five years, America has been governed by those who believe that what is best for the most fortunate among us is what is best for all. <strong>[Wrong! I've seen time after time when what's needed by the neediest has been worked for. Congress would gladly have cut the funding that's needed to help our veterans who are maimed and disabled. Congress had the gall to add pork barrel grants amended to the bills that were written to provide emergency funding to tend to those who bore the battle that we may live in freedom. That was more important to them than making sure promises to our Armed Forces were kept.]<br />
<br />
</strong>That is wrong.<br />
<br />A strong, vibrant <span>
<span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span>
</span>
<span> is what makes America a land of opportunity, stability, and shared values</span>.<br />
<br />But the American <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> did not happen by accident. It was built. <strong>[True. It was built by those who had nothing when they started out and didn't have any qualms about who they stepped on as they climbed the social order. Getting any feelings of fracking up, Bayh? Probably not, since your forefathers were the ones who started out on that ladder and you've just added your little bit to the destruction of those less fortunate than your war chest political campaign.]<br />
<br />
</strong>For twelve generations, Americans have made the tough decisions, the sacrifices, done the hard work to make America an exceptional nation.<br />
<br />Now is our time.<br />
<br />We must begin by recognizing the challenges and unprecedented change facing <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> Americans today.<strong> [Hey, Bayh, you really need to take a look at what the vast majority of your constituents have money-wise to survive on. We're talking little to no little "luxuries" such as a home computer, Internet service (BTW, is Al Gore still babbling on about him being the "father of the Internet? Curious minds want to know.), or a meal at a fast food "restaurant".]<br />
<br />
</strong>Globalization is transforming our economy. Too many good jobs are going overseas. Employees can no longer count on good health insurance or pensions. Skyrocketing health and energy costs squeeze family budgets.<strong> [Bayh, you really need to do some research into how many of the Grant and Hamilton counties in your home state are irrevocably gone to India, Mexico, and other countries. Your constituents are now greatly in the poverty class due to the globalization. Heck, small business employers can't afford any insurance for themselves or anyone they may hire. This I speak of on a personal level. One of the reasons our country is losing so many jobs is due to NAFTA which President Clinton had no problem signing and which has directly caused huge numbers of jobs and companies to Mexico.]<br />
<br />
</strong>A <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> life has never been easy, but itâs getting harder by the day. <strong>[Cry me a river. If you want to talk about life never being easy try living for a year on the level of funding a disabled veteran gets, with no outside assistance to help you in the style to which you're more than accustomed. You wouldn't last a week without yelling for help or coming up with some excuse for not being able to fulfill this.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Our aging population means more families are caring for their children â and their parents, too.<br />
<br />At a time when a college degree is still the best ticket to success, fewer and fewer <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> families can afford the cost.<strong> [And hang the poor who can only dream of going to college. No wonder they enter the Armed Forces with the GI bill a goal to strive for.]<br />
<br />
</strong>All of this and more is moving the American Dream out of reach for too many and creating anxiety for our<strong> <span>Middle Class</span>. [You want to talk of anxiety? Bayh, you haven't a clue what real anxiety is.]<br />
<br />
</strong>They ask, how can our children hope to have a better future if things continue like this?<br />
<br />I am confident they can. But not with the leaders weâve got and not if we continue down the road that weâre on.<strong> [Most definitely not with the road the Democratic Party is wanting to lead us down. Ever since the 1999 Presidential Election was lost to the Democrats their party leaders have had only one very much publicized goal - to destroy the Republican party and do whatever it takes to stop anything that the Republicans do for the good of the US. Talk about tunnel visioned sociopathic psychopaths!]<br />
<br />
</strong>President Bush and Vice President Cheney have done more for fewer Americans and less for most Americans than any Administration in history.<br />
<br />They have either ignored the challenges facing our <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> or made matters worse.<br />
<br />Through inaction, incompetence, and ideological extremism, the Bush Administration and their friends in Congress have made the ladder of success much harder to climb.<strong> [As if you're willing to help the lower class climb the ladder of success. By your own words in this speech the only ones who matter a damn to you are the Middle Class, and that's only due to your party not giving a rip about other voters.]<br />
<br />
</strong>On issue after issue, Bush, Cheney and Rove have lived for today and forgotten about tomorrow. They have focused on the next election not the next generation. And they have cynically appealed to Americansâ narrow self-interest instead of the common good. They may have won some elections, but the American <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> has lost valuable ground. <strong>[Note: Pot, meet Kettle. Obviously you're projecting others of being what you yourself are, "narrow self-interest cynics".]<br />
<br />
</strong>College costs go up, and they raise interest rates on student loans.<br />
<br />Retirement insecurities mount, and they want to privatize Social Security making seniors less secure. <strong>[Bayh, under what your goals are seniors and those reaching the age where they're shortly going to be recipients of Social Security they're already being shown they have less worth to you than yesterdays' newspaper. Here's hoping you're bit in the butt by your own words in any and all future elections.]<br />
<br />
</strong>When companies go bankrupt, executives get golden parachutes and workersâ pensions get the shaft. Just look at Delphi in my home state. Itâs a disgrace.<strong> [Not to mention the golden parachute given to any and all former Congress Critters for life! Of course, the raises you guys got due to not voting for a raise for yourselves isn't being mentioned by you. Hypocrite!]<br />
<br />
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> jobs are eliminated because of global competition. Their response? Turn a blind eye to currency manipulation, illegal subsidies and intellectual property theft squandering American hard work and ingenuity.<br />
<br />Health care costs are skyrocketing, and they have no prescription.<strong> [It doesn't concern him what happens to the poor who are literally wondering if they should buy medicine they need to survive or not buy food, if they should not buy gas to keep their 10 year old car running (they can't afford a new car) or have needed dental work done. No wonder it took a proctologist to find Bayh's head!]<br />
<br />
</strong>Energy costs soar, hitting consumers at the pump. Their answer is to have no answer. America is more dependent on imported oil today than we were on 9/11. On one of the defining challenges of our time, weâve made no progress whatsoever. None. </p>
<p>Vice President Cheney, who is in Iowa today, tells audiences that âHousehold net worth is at an all-time high.â Like so much about this Administration, he is technically accurate but grossly misleading. The truth is that <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> Americans are working harder than ever and receiving less. Average household income has declined every year during the Bush presidency. <strong>[Not to mention those whose incomes don't even reach Middle Class or who have now lost their employment due to NAFTA (thanks for nothing, Bubba!) and are feverishly looking for employment at their former wages and good luck there, cause you're going to need it!]<br />
<br />
</strong>The Administration has increased the national debt by nearly $3 trillion, money our <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> and children must repay with interest. They borrow from Japan, China, Persian Gulf Countries, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Germany, even Mexico. They are mortgaging our future. This is not how great leaders act.<br />
<br />This Administration has been stunningly blind to the forces shaping our future.<strong> [Yadda, Yadda. The Democratic party has done nothing to help our country but doesn't have any qualms about doing whatever it takes to bad mouth our President, his administration, or our country's leadership. Yep, that means you, Democrat!]<br />
<br />
</strong>The result?<br />
<br />Ideologues and special interests win. The <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> loses. Itâs that simple. And it must change.<strong> [And under your plan, Evan, everyone loses. It's plain and simple. If you put one income class above all others you're doing your level best to destroy the other classes. It's cut and dried. Bet you didn't think that others would read what you wrote and shove it in your face as outright hypocrisy.]<br />
<br />
</strong>But while Americans are crying out for something better, they see Washington as indifferent, hostile or self-absorbed. And theyâre right. <strong>[Wrong! We see the Democratic party and its' leadership doing what you accuse Washington of doing. We've seen this for more than 6 years and there's no sign that you or your party is going to learn, or is capable of learning, from its' mistakes.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Washington is broken. There is a chasm between what <span>
<strong>Middle America</strong>
</span> needs and what Washington delivers: all wedge issues, all spin, all cynicism, all gridlock, all the time.<br />
<br />Itâs as if Washington is on a different planet.<strong> [Again, here and in the paragraph immediately above you're projecting what you and your party are doing.]<br />
</strong>Once you could tell a system was broken when it took a crisis to trigger a response. But today, right now, we have crisis after crisisâ¦Katrina, energy, the budget, health costs, Iraq, â¦and to each of these crises, the system doesnât respond.<br />
<br />Washington rewards and preserves the status quo as though that were its central purpose.<br />
<br />Too many have forgotten that we represent the interests of our constituents in Washington, not the other way around.<strong> [Evan, you're sure as shiite aren't in touch with what your constituents are going through. As I said before, consider this a challenge to move here and live with the low-level income that most of one small city in Grant County has to live on for a period of no less than one full year. You'd not be able to stand the culture shock of going from your ivory tower and exorbitant pay to what they have to exist on.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Too many have forgotten what Harry Truman said: In America, itâs not the politicians who run the country. Itâs the people. The politicians are just the hired help.<strong> [Which is exactly what you and the other DemocRATs have forgotten due to being so blinded with hatred of anything remotely attached to other political parties.]<br />
<br />
</strong>As frustration mounts with a broken Washington, the <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> looks to the Democratic Party for hope â as they always have. And what do they see?<strong> [As a former Democratic party member I'll tell you exactly what I see, a party that is so obsessed with hatred that they'll do whatever it takes to hurt, damage, or destroy anyone and anything that's not Democratic Party centric. The party has become so psychopathic that it's basically entered self-destruct phase with little to no hope of regaining its' sanity and actually caring about what's best for the country.]<br />
<br />
</strong>I was born and raised a Democrat. I am proud of what my Party has accomplished for America. If you look at the great progress of the last century â the changes in America that make you most proudâ none of them would have occurred without the leadership of the Democratic Party.<strong> [Yeah, sure, whatever. The last Democratic president we had had no qualms about stealing the contents of Air Force One when he and his wife were moving out of the White House. That president was so obtuse that he had the audacity to ask a court what the definition of "is" was. That president was so clueless that he had the gall to say that oral sex wasn't sex. I am ashamed to admit that I was ever a member of this party, but do so in the interest of Fair Disclosure.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Lifting this country out of the Great Depression, winning two World Wars, drawing the line in the sand against communism, landing a man on the moon, civil rights, womenâs rights, the GI Bill, Social Security, Medicare, aid to education, and on and on.<br />These were the accomplishments that shaped Americaâs century and made Americaâs blue and white-collar workers the most prosperous and free on Earth.<strong> [Kindly note that this weasel didn't even mention what the political parties were during these times. In other words, he's doing his best to make people believe that these things were all due to his party and frack full disclosure.]<br />
<br />
</strong>But was long ago. Memories are short.<strong> [As you doubtless hope is true of everyone that lives in America legally. Are you stating this hopefully, Evan? Hmmm?]<br />
<br />
</strong>We may consider ourselves the party of the <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span>, but too many <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> Americans no longer consider us their party.<strong> [Oh, I understand now. You're basically saying that unless you're Middle Class don't bother applying for membership in your "illustrious" party. Thanks for the clarification.]<br />
<br />
</strong>They have left the Democratic Party in droves -- costing us the last two presidential elections and the last six congressional elections, and if we donât learn some lessons, weâll lose in 2006 and 2008 as well.<strong> [Wrong. The reasons why your party lost the last two presidential elections is they saw all too clearly that your party backed an adulterer who was such a weasel that he lied about anyone and everything that he thought gave him a bad image. Remember Monica, a little blue dress, the State Troopers who went out hunting for sex partners for a certain party, and your political party doing everything in its' power to refocus on any and everything else, not to mention Al Gore screaming about the legal aspects of what votes counted, Electoral College or the number of actual votes?]<br />
<br />
</strong>We must not let that happen. Because the <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> is more than a source of votes for my Party, it is a fundamental part of who we are as Democrats and Americans. <strong>[Evan, let me get this straight. You're saying that if you're not a Democrat you're not an American? Cause that's sure how this comes across.]<br />
<br />
</strong>So I offer this advice to my fellow Democrats: without an agenda that speaks directly to the <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> and all who aspire to it, we are no longer the Party of Roosevelt, Truman, Kennedy, and Clinton. And we will not be a majority party. Our nation must do better, but for that to happen, we Democrats must, too.<strong> [Yep, confirmation of what I just asked has been given here. Thanks for dissing a preponderant portion of Americans in one fell swoop. The next sound you hear will be your standing in your constituents point of view going down the proverbial tubes.]<br />
<br />
</strong>We have both a patriotic responsibility and a political imperative to reclaim our legacy as the party of the <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> by fighting for their interests and by producing results that make a difference in their lives. <strong>[Frack everyone else, full steam ahead, eh Sen. Bayh?]<br />
<br />
</strong>This begins with understanding their concerns.<strong> [Evan, you wouldn't understand anyone else's concerns if they bit you in the butt due to your political myopia.]<br />
<br />
</strong>In my travels across Indiana and 22 other states last year, in coffee shops, living rooms, and union halls talking with ordinary Americans about their hopes, their dreams, and their anxieties, three areas dominate.<strong> [Uh huh. Yep. If you say so. What the frack do you know about ordinary Americans? Odds are you only went to households that had been previously vetted as espousing your agenda and paid handsomely to your campaign account.]<br />
<br />
</strong>One is Security. All Americans know it is a dangerous world. Three thousand people were killed on September 11th. Suicidal terrorists have pledged to attack again - and they have in London, Madrid, Amman, Bali, and across Iraq. North Korea has expanded its nuclear arsenal and tested missiles intended to hit the United States. Hamas is in charge of the Palestinian Authority. The Middle East is aflame. And the radical leader of Iran seeks nuclear weapons, has pledged to destroy Israel, and has asked his people to imagine a world without the United States. <strong>[Gee, the leader of Iran seems to have the same goal for our country as do the Democrats with their now removed Internet links on their goals of doing whatever it takes to discredit the President, our government, and the Republicans.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Most Americans know â and this is borne out in poll after poll â that President Bush and Karl Rove are a lot better at national security politics than national security policy. Instead of making us more secure, they have undermined our security. Iraq is the foremost example. They have turned it into a tragic, tragic, mess.<strong> [What part of the historical sectarian feud between Sunnis, Shia'ia, and every other Muslim sect or other religion in Iraq don't you get, Evan? As far as these tribal groups understand it's their sworn duty to kill any and all who don't hold the same religious beliefs that they do and this has been going on for about 1,400 years! It's not the fault of President Bush or Karl Rove that these savages are on a literal religious blood hunt and it doesn't matter who is killed, for in their eyes it's the will of Allah.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Democrats can do better.<br />
<br />America needs a national security strategy that is both tough and smart. We Democrats must reclaim the tough and smart legacy of Roosevelt, Truman, and Kennedy, and aggressively challenge the President and his party about who can do a better job of securing this country. We must go toe to toe with Republicans on this issue, not try to change the subject or pretend it doesnât exist. Ceding the ground of national security to the Republican Party has hurt our standing with the <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span>. We must never make that mistake again. Most Americans are also looking for leaders who share their values and understand their lives. Many are working longer hours for less money while their children are alone at home at the mercy of a coarsening culture. Parents are anxious about the influence of violent video games and Internet pornography, obscene music and television, and the danger of predators stalking our children across cyberspace. As a parent with young children, I share these concerns.<strong> [The mistake your party made is believing that all and sundry are going to rally to your cause and not do their homework. Doing so shows the evidence that the Democrats are to be trusted at about the same level as Saddam and his excuses for the torture and murders of thousands of Kurds, Iraqis and Kuwaitis or the insane Iranian President who's working for a world war so the 13th Imam will return.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Values matter, and Democrats must understand the non-economic pressures facing most families today, not just the economic ones. We must have an agenda that speaks to the heart and the pocketbook, not one or the other. But economic opportunity is always on peopleâs minds. It is my focus today.<strong> [The heart says "run away" from this group as it's heading in the same direction as an overabundance of lemmings.]<br />
<br />
</strong>As Democrats, we must ask: âDoes our agenda speak to the great majority of Americans in the economic middle?â<strong> [My heartfelt response? Hel, NO!]<br />
<br />
</strong>Too often, they are telling us ânoâ â and voting for Republicans in increasing numbers. Why? Because too often our signature proposals do nothing directly for them. Just one example:<br />
<br />Over the past 10 years, the economic issue emphasized most by Democrats is raising the minimum wage. Raising the minimum wage is absolutely the right thing to do. And shame on the Republicans for blocking it for all of these years.<strong> [No, shame on the Democrats for doing their level best to try to make themselves look good by pushing for something that most small mom and pop businesses just plain can't afford. If the minimum wage is raised and is more than a small company can afford, what happens? Simple, they fire the help and add more work to themselves. Who's the winner in that situation? Nobody wins, but man, do the Democrats in power sure feel good cause they raised the minimum wage.]<br />
<br />
</strong>But this year, less than three percent of workers earned the minimum wage or less.<strong> [Evan, what color is the sky on your planet? What you so blindly fail to realize is that the vast majority of the legal population in this country is living below Middle Class wages. Then again, anyone can bend the polls to what they want to see or what they think/know those who paid for the polls wants to "prove". For example, if I paid for a poll to show how many people think that you're totally in touch with the actual conditions under which most of your contituents work and it came out as 98% <em>against</em> you'd more than likely say the poll was biased.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Raising the minimum wage must be an important part of the Democratic economic agenda â it is the moral, just and wise thing to do. But it cannot be seen as the entirety of our economic agenda.<strong> [Just where the frack do you expect small business owners, who are struggling with major increases in shipping, transportation, and so many more factors to magically come up with funds that just plain aren't there to pay increased wages to employees? Here's a hint: if the money's not there to pay higher minimum wages employess are going to be laid off or fired. Not to mention that anyone living on minimum wages doesn't remotely come close to the Middle Class income brackets. Here's hoping such people remember how you feel about them when election time rolls around.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Working to eliminate poverty, which my friend John Edwards speaks so eloquently about is a moral imperative. But if we don't also directly strengthen the Middle Class, we will never achieve our potential as a nation. And Democrats will not be in position to help anyone, poor and <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> alike.<strong> [Gee, nice of you to admit there are poor people. That being said, this whole speech disregards them except for in this one paragraph. I do have to admit that you're letting all and sundry know that this income group is <em>not </em>a concern to you and your party.]<br />
<br />
</strong>We must convince <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> Americans that weâre on their side not only by fighting poverty but by directly addressing their challenges, too. Too often they see one not the other. It must be both.<strong> [So let me get this straight. You're now saying that Middle Class Americans are those who live in poverty. You can't have it both ways, Evan. You really need to get out into the general public without prior vetting and notification that you're about to descend from your position of wealth and power and see how John and Jane Q. Public in the $20,000 and less yearly income has to make decisions of whether to eat decent meals or have their health care or educational needs met. Then again, you probably don't even have a clue how much a gallon of milk or a loaf of bread costs.]<br />
<br />
</strong>And we must embrace <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> economic values. Americans have always believed that hope is more powerful than fear, opportunity as essential as security, a ladder up as important as a safety net below. That success â through hard work, ingenuity, and thrift â is a virtue to admire not envy. <strong>[Hope? Hope is pretty much a fracking joke when the populace is governed by clueless wonders such as yourself and your party as a whole. Evan, stop by a unemployment office where someone is being told that this will be their last unemployment check. Stop by a Workforce One office where those desperately seeking work and are sent on job seeking jaunts are faced with the awful truths that they're considered too old for education in a field related to the last job they had. As a priestess I've had to counsel such ones who are without hope of ever again having more than $400 a month to live on. Then again, taking me up on this challenge would take you places where you would never dream of going.]<br />
<br />
</strong>This is what we did in Indiana. It was <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> prosperity from good jobs that paid for health care, education, and greater opportunity for the less fortunate. The Middle Class was our engine of progress. It must be for the nation as well.<strong> [As you point out, every one of these things is "was" as in the past. There aren't good jobs, there is less and less opportunity for the less fortunate. So, you're saying that such ones really don't count as they're not Middle Class, correct?]<br />
<br />
</strong>As you all undoubtedly know, I am thinking about running for President â I havenât made a final decision â but if I do run, creating opportunity for <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> Americans will be a centerpiece of my campaign. Itâs a message I will take across America on behalf of other candidates this fall.<strong> [May the gods have mercy on our country should you or one of your party win in the 2008 presidential election, or if your party wins the majority in Congress.]<br />
<br />
</strong>I will go into greater detail later, but today, I want to lay out just a few of the potential building blocks of an Opportunity Society for our <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span>.<br />
<br />We must begin by making college more affordable.<strong> [Affordable? Sen. Bayh, anyone who lives with an income below $20,000 and doesn't receive a full scholarship or receive assistance in paying the astronomical fees related to college can hang up any chance of ever receiving higher education or a well-paying job that requires a degree. Do you or your party intend on helping such ones be able to attend college? I didn't think so.]<br />
<br />
</strong>In a global economy that values ingenuity and technological know-how, a college degree is as important as a high school diploma was 50 years ago. Now, we must make it as common.<strong> [No chit, but as I pointed out there are a sea of Americans who would love to go to college and receive higher learning. Unfortunately, for the vast majority this opportunity will remain only a dream which will slowly fade away as is the norm with most dreams.]<br />
<br />
</strong>We could provide a $6,000 refundable tax credit to cover the first $6,000 of college costs. This would pay for 100 percent of the average tuition for a four-year public university and help families making up to $100,000 per year, 87 percent of all Americans.<strong> ["A $6,000 refundable tax credit". Would you care to enlighten us on where those earning anywhere from poverty level to say $60,000 a year are going to come up with that kind of money in the first place?]<br />
<br />
</strong>Rising health care costs are also squeezing family budgets and harming small businesses, the most dynamic part of our economy. People ask me about health care more than any other domestic issue.<br />
<br />We cannot solve this complex problem today, but we can start.<strong> [If you and your party really gave a tinker's damn about this you would be pushing the legislation for the help through without adding all kinds of pork barrel projects as amendments.]<br />
<br />
</strong>The risk of catastrophic illness â cancer, heart disease, stroke â raises insurance premiums for small businesses and individuals substantially. We could cap individual and small business risk by covering 75 percent of health costs above $50,000. This would cut insurance premiums by up to 20 percent for small businesses and individuals, helping 57 million middle income Americans. <strong>[Covering 75 percent of health costs over $50,000? You are seriously out of touch with reality in thinking that everyone can afford to pay tens of thousands of dollars or more. Most Americans at the lower end of the income bracket do without medical care despite knowing that this can or will add to the likelihood of death or disability of themself or their loved ones.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Retirement security is another challenge for <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> Americans. Social Security, pensions and savings are all part of the answer, and all must be strengthened.<br />
<br />This is not the forum for addressing Social Securityâs long-term imbalances, but privatizing the system would only make seniorsâ insecurities worse. Social Security has done more to help <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> seniors from falling into poverty than anything else.<strong> [And what do you propse for the seniors who are facing the remainder of their lives in insecurity due to increased Medicare costs, increased medical bills and the uncertainty of being put in a nursing home or an assisted care facility should their health take a major turn for the worse?]<br />
<br />
</strong>But it takes more to maintain a <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> life in retirement than Social Security.<br />
<br />Workers whoâve earned pensions deserve protection. When corporations try to shed their obligations in bankruptcy, employee benefits deserve priority status.<br />
<br />And we need to make it easier for all Americans to save for retirement. The system should favor the <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> by replacing the current 401(k) and IRA deduction with a 30 percent government match. This would promote retirement savings for more than 90 percent of Americans to supplement pensions and Social Security.<strong> [Where do you propose those earning minimum wage come up with the opportunity or the money to have a 401(k) or IRA ? Minimum wage jobs don't offer the opportunity to engage in such a luxury as trying to ensure good income in their senior years.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Finally, energy security and affordability is a defining challenge of our time. With drivers and businesses getting hit at the pump, itâs an important <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> issue, too.<br />
<br />I propose tax credits up to $3,400 for the purchase of new, high mileage vehicles to help drivers conserve and to make ethanol widely available so consumers can chose between gasoline and ethanol, whichever is cheaper.<br />
<br />These ideas, and many more, are the types of things we should consider to help <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> Americans meet our challenges and fulfill our potential.<br />
<br />Itâs possible that all are not doable at once, and all must comply with fiscal reality. But the important thing is to begin, to let <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> Americans know that weâre on their side, share their priorities and will help whenever we can.<strong> [Share your priorities? How the frack can you possibly know what the priorities are of the minimum wage earner or the monthly pittance given to our active duty Armed Forces personnel, the disabled, or the senior citizen who exists on what remains of their planned income after promised pensions are worthless due to the huge "golden parachutes" given to the Middle Class executives of a bankrupt company?]<br />
<br />
</strong>We have waited too long.<br />
<br />For 230 years, Americans have been dedicated to the self-evident truths that all men and women are created equal and have been endowed by our Creator with inalienable rights â life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.<br />
<br />At the heart of this ideal â at the heart of the American Promise â is that everyone whoâs willing to work hard and dream big and sacrifice can make their dreams come true.<strong> [Earth to Sen. Evan Bayh, "The American Promise" does not play out for the vast majority who are breaking their health striving for jobs that are not there for them due to the flood of criminals who enter our borders illegally.]<br />
<br />
</strong>Now, the tides of history challenge that belief, whether a nation characterized not by class differences but common opportunity, common values, common dreams â a dominant <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> â can survive.<strong> [Make up your mind, Evan. You are perpetuating class differences in your 46 count of Middle Class references in this diatribe. In this piece of self-serving bovine waste material you have denigrated everyone who doesn't hold a six-figure income or higher repeatedly.]<br />
<br />
</strong>I believe it can. And I believe it must.<br />
<br />But nothing is pre-ordained or etched in stone. Our destiny is up to us.<br />
<br />Our present leaders have proven inadequate to the task. They have not focused on our future and what will make it better.<br />
<br />Instead, they are committed to a deep-seated philosophical belief, hostile to our <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong>. It is the same conceit used throughout history to justify concentration of opportunity in the hands of the few. <strong>[Evan, your "deep-seated philosophical belief" concerning every class and every person who is not Middle Class is showing and it is very apparent how little you judge their worth to be.]<br />
<br />
</strong>This is not the American way. It is not the Democratic Party way.<strong> [Uh, Evan, you might want to check at the bank for your reality check is bouncing. This is exactly the way the DemoncRATic Party has been doing for the last 50 years at least. Your Party is so out of touch with reality and so filled with venomous hatred bordering on the obsessed pathological that the Party faithful need help and they need it <em>now</em>!]<br />
<br />
</strong>At this critical moment, when a brighter future filled with more hope and opportunity and progress is ours to make, we must do better than what George Bush has offered us.<br />
<br />We must change the dysfunctional mess that is Washington. <strong>[Dysfunctional would be Howard "Aaarrgh" Dean, Al Gore, John Kerry ... shall I continue with these prime examples of who <em>not</em> to follow?]<br />
<br />
</strong>We must re-establish the Democratic Party as the instrument of <span>
<strong>Middle Class</strong>
</span> progress.<strong> [Frack anyone who doesn't meet your criteria for Middle Class is your goal, right, Evan?]<br />
<br />
</strong>We must summon the American people to meet the challenges and make the hard decisions these times demand.<strong> [Which seems to include destroying anyone who doesn't meet your goal of having at least $65k a year for income according to what I'm reading in this speech.]<br />
<br />
</strong>The road to American greatness does not lie down the path of least resistance. We have followed that course too long.<br />
<br />With new leaders and a new direction, there is no obstacle we cannot overcome.<br />
<br />And if we do these things, our <strong>
<span>Middle Class</span>
</strong> will prosper. America will be strong. The Democratic Party will lead the nation.<br />
<br />And most important, we will deserve to.<br />
<br />Thank you."</p>
</blockquote>I counted no less than 46 times that Bayh used the term "Middle Class" in this speech. To me that says that the poor and the wealthy aren't Americans in his mind.<br />
<br />Hint to the DummycRATS: You guys lost the 1999 election and the 2003 election. Ever since Al Gore whined like a spoiled brat since he didn't win under our national election laws where it's the electoral college and not popular vote your party has lost credibility. <p></p>
<p>Was I a DummycRAT registered voter? Yep. At one time I honestly thought this party actually cared about the law and tried to run the US honestly. Bubba and Shrillary's antics caused a serious reality check on my part. Al Gore's terrible two's tantrums and the monotomous shrilling of "BushHitlerHalliburtonNaziRepuglican" and the cries for the death of any "Repugs" or "NeoCons" has ensured that I, for one, will never vote for another Democrat. I can only hope that the Republicans will keep the majority of Congress and that no Democratic presidential candidate will ever sit in that high office.<br />
<br />If that happens, Gods protect the US for we're going to need all the help we can get.</p>
