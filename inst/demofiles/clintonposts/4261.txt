Hillary Clinton has canceled an appearance Saturday before a Hispanic advocacy group in Hartford because of a labor protest planned for outside the venue, the organization announced Friday.</p>
<p>Clinton, D-N.Y., was to give the keynote speech at the 30th anniversary gala of the Connecticut Association of United Hispanic Agencies Inc. at the Hartford Civic Center. The event will benefit the group and its programs.</p>
<p>The group, known as CAUSA, said Clinton decided not to attend because of a protest planned by the Greater Hartford-New Britain Building and Construction Trades Council.</p>
<p>The council announced that it was holding the rally to protest ING Group Inc., which had been a sponsor of Saturday&#8217;s event, because of its decision to not guarantee work for minority contractors and other Connecticut construction workers as it builds a new facility in Windsor.</p>
<p>The trades council said the financial services company initially committed to using labor union resources to construct the building, but later changed its mind.</p>
<p>&quot;The ING Group is the major sponsor of this statewide event and we plan to show that throwing a few dollars out for an event is not the only way to be seen as a good community neighbor,&quot; trades council President Charles LeConche said in a prepared statement earlier this week.</p>
<p>Carmen Sierra, executive director of CAUSA, said the trades council demanded last week that ING withdraw because of the dispute. She said ING did withdraw its involvement and financial support for the event earlier this week, but the trades council then reneged on an agreement it made with CAUSA about the protest.</p>
<p>&quot;This action by Charles LeConche is outrageous,&quot; Sierra said. &quot;We agreed to his initial demands, but it is clear now that he was interested in only creating a media event for himself.</p>
<p>&quot;Mr. LeConche has caused immeasurable damage to the building trade union which has had to struggle to get blacks and Latinos in their ranks,&quot; she said. &quot;This renegade action by Mr. LeConche to gratuitously cause damage to the Latino community will not be forgotten.&quot;</p>
<p>Clinton&#8217;s press secretary, Philippe Reines, confirmed that the senator will not be attending the event, but offered no further comments.</p>
