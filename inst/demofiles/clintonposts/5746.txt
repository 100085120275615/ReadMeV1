Governor Michael Rounds, normally neutral, is thought to be on the verge of signing a bill that would outlaw all abortion, even in cases of rape and incest.

I'm still visiting my sister and her family until sometime Friday. The weather outside is a smidge colder than I like it. I've been reading a lot-hey what else is new?-and one of the books is about reincarnation while the other two are about the history of immigration in the U.S. and what constitutes an American. I've been experimenting with how to put smileys into this thing but it's tough because I'm new to it. Mary Anne's friend Mimi just called from Massachusetts. That was the big highlight of my day.<br />Hey, I took a walk down to the business district past St. Mary of the Isle Church.

I'm plugging away at a computer. I'm an awfully early bird as far as getting up unfortunately.<br />Right now, I'm still visiting Mary Anne. Tomorrow night is the big move. Steve and I shall be on our way to Pennsylvania where I shall be living from now on.<br />---------From the <strong>I'm Bad I'm Nationwide Department:</strong><br />: I don't know my way around the general area of Long Beach. Today was the very first time ever that I cruised around the local side streets of city instead of just to and from by way of parkways. It turned out to be more than a little bit of a mistake. I ended up on a parkway on my way to JFK Airport. Fortunately I made a u turn because there was no traffic. I got away with it because there were no policemen either. I spent loooong boooring time roaming around in circles. I finally and at last asked some young guy (Dairy Barn employee ) for directions and made it back. The whole thing started because I wanted a full tank of gas and refuse to set foot anywhere near a Mobil station.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, April 28, 2006:</strong> <strong>The Devil Went Down to Egypt: </strong>In an area north and east of El Minya, Egypt, According to National Geographic Magazine <a href="http://www9.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel">http://www9.nationalgeographic.com/lostgospel</a><br /><strong></strong>the supposed Gospel of Judas has been found. Supposedly written between 130-170 A.D. it casts Jesus' traitor as a trustworthy friend, and as having betrayed Jesus out of obedience to Him. Of course, it's all an obvious lie. I'll bet those Jesus Seminar characters are having a good laugh. Gnosticism never really goes away. It just blends in with whatever happens to be current at any given time. Only the books and epistles accepted by the Catholic Church at the Council of Trent(1545-1563) as "sacred and canonical" are to be acknowledged as legitimate. For further information, read: <a href="http://www.vivificat.org/2006/04/bearer-of-bad-news-brief-analysis-of.html">http://www.vivificat.org/2006/04/bearer-of-bad-news-brief-analysis-of.html</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, May 1, 2006:</strong> I'm now a Pennsylvanian. Steve and I drove my car into Wyoming this past Friday night. It's a very nice environment. Soon I'll be tracking down a job. Yesterday I enrolled as an official parishioner at Our Lady of Sorrows Church in West Wyoming and joined their Holy Name Society last night. Today I got a card at Wyoming's Free Library right next to but much smaller than the Methodist Church. It's a very busy very sloppy time for me.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, May 2, 2006:</strong> Yesterday, the Feast of St. Joseph the Worker, I tracked down St. Joseph's Church in Wyoming. I missed Mass-unfortunately there was no Mass at O.L. Sorrows- but I spent some time in front of the Blessed Sacrament praying the Rosary. Everything is still nightmarishly busy at the new house. All sorts of repairs have to be made. The library is much nicer-with much more peace and quiet-than that stark raging nuthouse over in Copiague. I'm still trying to get to know the roads, stores, hot spots etc. of the new area.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, May 3, 2006:</strong> Today, I went to 8 a.m. Mass at St. John the Evangelist Church in Pittston. My mother, Uncle Frankie and I made sure that we went because it was a Mass for Aunt Mary Theresa. It would have been her and Uncle Frankie's 56th wedding anniversary. After that we went grocery shopping. <strong>The long and winding road: </strong>Then I took a tour of the area without a map and found out the hard way that I need much help with directions. I stopped at a local gas station/convenience store and bought a map of each county. Before that I asked a couple of people for directions proving quite conclusively that we men are a hell of a lot more afraid of getting lost than we are of asking for directions. It's a lovely day and the library is very nice and quiet unlike its Copiague counterpart. All is still total chaos at the house.<br />A complaint to the friars at<strong> </strong><strong>The Franciscans of the Immaculata: </strong><a href="http://www.marymediatrix.com">http://www.marymediatrix.com</a> Just exactly when, may I ask, is your forum supposed to be back up again? It's exremely interesting and extremely informative for those of us who have an interest in following the Immaculata.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, May 4, 2006</strong>: Other than Rte 11(Wyoming Ave.) these roads out here are an absolute madhouse for the uninitiated. Mountains in bad weather must be pure hell.<br />I've been to Mass in a few churches over here lately and the shortage of diocesan priests is an absolute travesty. If any young single, orthodox Catholic man would be willing to consider a vocation as a diocesan priest, he should get in touch with Fr. Thomas M. Muldowney, the vocation director for the Diocese of Scranton at mailto: <a href="mailto:rev-thomas-muldowney@dioceseofscranton.org">mailto:rev-thomas-muldowney@dioceseofscranton.org</a> There are all sorts of Religious communities that need new young people too.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday</strong>, <strong>May 5, 2006</strong>: Today is another groovy day. My parents have been married for a grand total of a half century-without a single argument. All is quite well as I persist in trying to get the lay of the land. Soon enough, I shall get a Pa. license, job etc. Friends would be a mighty nice touch too. People out here seem to be quite a good bunch. The house is still an absolute nightmare. A million repairs have to be made. Today is the plumber's turn. The painters will be showing up late.<br />Of course it is the month of May, the month dedicated to the Immaculata. Everyone must continuously further develop his devotion to Her by praying her Rosary and other chaplets, and wearing her brown Carmelite scapular and Miraculous Medal.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, May 6, 2006: </strong>Yesterday was El Cinco de Mayo. Because my old pal Mary Gallagher (la Senora Rodriguez to her students) is a Spanish teacher, I have the inside scoop on stuff like this. Living in Pennsylvania is still, so far, a hoot. Today it's been drizzling slightly. I went to first Saturday Mass at 7:30 a.m. today. O.L.P.H. , with the help of the Knights of Fatima, goes all out with a Rosary, Mass and continental breakfast. St. Joseph's just has an organist and singers for first Friday and first Saturday Masses.<br />On the Carmelite calendar, yesterday was the feast day of St. Angelus and there are more to come.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, May 8, 2006: </strong>Carmelite wise, today is the feast of Bl. Aloysius Rabata' and tomorrow is the feast of Bl. George Preca.<br />Today I went to an employment agency on Wyoming Avenue in Kingston to apply for help getting a job. The ladies said my chances seemed pretty good of getting a day shift, Monday to Friday job-my very first ever job outside New York.<br />The house is still a nut house. I hung out with Fran and Uncle Frankie a lot over the weekend and talked to Gary's wife Maria yesterday on the phone. All is still about the same in New York.<br />Please read the new blog/yahoo group,Mary Vitamin on my link list. I always like to encourage links that promote True Devotion to Mary.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, May 9, 2006: </strong>Today was a pretty hectic day for me. After 7:00 a.m. Mass at St. Joseph's I got ready to go with my father and Uncle Frankie to get our license problems-new state, new rules-straightened out. We found out that they have all sorts of requirements about I.D. and we didn't have enough on us. We're hoping for better luck next time. We spent plenty of time cleaning up the house. Old pictures are very nice to see but the confusion is annoying.<br />I got the library later than usual.<br />I found out on the phone last night that Pittston's KofC council has meetings on first and third Monday nights of month.<br />I got my copy of the Long Island Catholic today. So far so good with the mail forwarding.<br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, May 10, 2006: </strong>All is well so far. Ever since my last few days in New York, I've gotten into the habit of taking at least one long (oh well, at least by my standards anyway) walk each day. I try each day to make sure that I go for a walk of at least a mile (round trip). I'm losing weight and hyperventilating at the same time.<br />I found out that Dan Brown's book,<strong> The DaVinci Code </strong>has been released as a movie. Please don't even think of so much as giving those characters the satisfaction of wasting your valuable time and money on it.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, May 11, 2006:</strong> Last night I watched Doug Keck, on the <strong>EWTN </strong>show <strong><em>BOOKENDS</em>,<em> </em></strong>interview a man who has written a book debunking <strong>The DaVinci Code. </strong>The author said that although Dan Brown claims his book is supposedly entirely fictional, he presents it in a way that leaves the average reader with extremely serious doubts about the Catholic Faith. Storytelling will often do that since a good storyteller, if he is able to captivate his reader's imagination, possesses an influence over him that no mere writer of non fiction can possibly match. This morning, on the same network, Fr. Mitch Pacwa, S.J. and Fr. Charles Connor of the Scranton Diocese argued that the supposed Gospel of Judas could also destroy people's souls because it casts doubt upon the true Gospels. In this entirely spurious gospel, the author claims that Judas Iscariot was told by Jesus to betray Him. They reminded us that mankind has been passing the blame for his sins ever since the Original Sin in the Garden of Eden. Adam and Eve blamed each other. The serpent blamed them. It's one of the consequences of Original Sin. This apocryphal gospel, if accepted, will destroy people's faith in the Church's teachings about sin.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, May 12, 2006: </strong>Last night it was pouring out but now the weather is much nicer. Today I made sure I went to CVS and got a much desperately needed photograph album. Oddly, when I tried to send something about the Friday dance, they threatened not to send it because of objectionable glamour and <a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=intimate%20apparel">intimate apparel</a>. Hey gimme a break!! The most risque thing in the whole thing is a cartoon belly dancer. That most certainly qualifies as stupid. The painters and plumber are still plowing through the house. Everything is still out of control but getting better all the time( it couldn't get much worse).<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, May 13, 2006: </strong>Today, among other droll, mundane things, I mowed the lawn. Tomorrow is Mother's Day. The weather outside is groovy. The work that still has to be done on the house is a bottomless pit. I think I'm having a mighty nice time out here in spite of all the changes. Yesterday I watched a Jesuit priest on <strong>EWTN. </strong>He made some especially significant points just in time for Mother's Day. He argued that it was altogether wrong for the Supreme Court to use subjective criteria in order to establish personhood(to be distinguished from mere humanness). A person, ethically understood, is in possession of certain entirely intrinsic and inviolable rights from the very instant of conception, that are his and can never legitimately be taken away. The mere possession of a soul(will, intellect, memory), even in the severely handicapped individual, qualifies him as a person because all of the requisite faculties are there at least in potentiality.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, May 15, 2006: </strong>Yesterday was Mother's Day. Happy day to all you mommies who qualify. We went to <strong>Cooper's Restaurant </strong>in Pittston to celebrate. I found out that it is very close to the <strong>Knights of Columbus </strong>council around here. Today, weather-wise, is the single lousiest day yet since I've been here. A couple of days ago there was a 5 minute ish rainstorm but today it's been consistently icy cold with an annoying drizzle. I was forced to trade in my light short sleeved shirt for my Tigger sweater.<br />I found out that on June 6, Congress will vote on whether or not to accept homosexual marriage as legal. If that ever happens our religious liberties as Christians will be destroyed.

Besides the usual painters and plumber, today the furniture guys and electrician showed up too. Things have been going fairly well for me as I get used to my entirely brand spanking new world. I have to get my resume together-a few changes are still required-so I can help that temporary agency get me a job.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, May 17, 2006: </strong>Yesterday was the feast day of <strong>St. Simon Stock</strong>, a really big name on the Carmelite calendar. According to Carmelite tradition, the <strong>Virgin Mary </strong>gave the brown scapular to St. Simon along with a promise that all who wear it and live by its conditions will be saved.<br />The weather outside today is colder than I like it but it's fairly nice. The painters are finished but the electrician and plumber are still busy. I'm still getting used to life around here.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, May 18, 2006: </strong>Late yesterday, there was a pretty substantial amount of rain and today it started drizzling again. I got over to that employment agency with my resume. We shall just have to wait and see exactly what they intend to get me from now on.

After a few minutes worth of annoying trial and error, I finally got it to work well.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, 22, 2006: </strong>Happy 44th birthday to my brother in law Steve, the mere spring chicken. I didn't get a chance to put anything into my blog on Saturday because that was the day of my very first ever Pennsylvania Carmelite meeting on South Meade Street in beautiful downtown Wilkes Barre. It was at the <strong>Little Flower Manor.</strong> I'm now a member of the Northeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the lay Carmelites. At 1:00 p.m. today until 6:00 p.m. <strong>Our Lady of Sorrows Church </strong>on 8th Street in West Wyoming is having a blood drive. Be there or be square.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, May 23, 2006: </strong>I gave my blood yesterday. I used to give, usually, at the <strong>Knights of Columbus</strong> in New York. The last time I gave a New York donation was at my high school a few months ago. My eleventh grade, seventh period history teacher, Brian Clancy, said hello. He still remembers me by name after all these decades. He took one look at me and blurted out "Lawrence". Out here I have no past. Today I applied for a job with the US Postal Service and am keeping my eyes and ears peeled for other openings.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, May 24, 2006: </strong>I seem to have spoken a smidge too soon about<a href="http://www.modblog.com">http://www.modblog.com</a> It's been working quite well lately so give it a chance please. It must have been going through certain technical difficulties a while ago. I keep putting out resumes wherever I can. Soon I hope I shall have a job. The weather out here is pretty freaky. First it's cold, then it's hot, rainy dry blah blah. Last night I watched<strong> It Happened One Night </strong>with Claudette Colbert, Alan Hale and Clark Gable. The night before I watched <strong>The Maltese Falcon </strong>with Myrna Loy, Humphrey Bogart, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet.

It was very good but I couldn't handle the two hours worth of subtitles. Today I got a reminder of the disadvantage of life around here. I tried to track down my old (<strong>SUNY Farmingdale)</strong> philosophy teacher's phone number. When I tried to open up an e mail from her so I could find it, there was a message on the screen saying that I wasn't allowed because it was adult and sexually explicit. That's beyond weird. Today is Ascension Thursday. It's a holy day of obligation so go to Mass.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, May 26, 2006: </strong>The 22 of this month was the Feast of St. Joachina de Vedruna de Mas and the 25, when it's not Ascension Thursday, is usually the feast of St. Mary Magdalene de Pazzi. This past week I've been watching the story of St. Teresa de Jesus on <strong>EWTN. </strong>Last night I watched the movie <strong>Lost Horizon </strong>with Edward Everett Horton, Jane Wyatt, Sam Jaffe and Ronald Colman. Today it rained miserably for about five minutes.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, May 27, 2006: </strong>Last night I watched the old Marlene Dietrich movie, <strong>Blue Angel</strong> in which she plays Lola Lola. The only other name that's even vaguely familiar is Emil Jannings. The Pennsylvania life is slowly but surely wangling its way into my system. The people seem as nice and interesting as all the New Yorkers I'm used to having to bluff my way past. Unpacking is still a nightmare. I think tomorrow night is the next <strong>Holy Name Society </strong>meeting.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, May 30, 2006: </strong>Well the <strong>Holy Name Society</strong>, as I should have known, won't be having any more meetings until September. I went to Gino and Michelle's big Memorial Day party on Sunday. It included a ride in their <a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=go%20cart">go cart</a>. Unfortunately I drank a smidge too much hooch and got a violent headache. The last two movies I watched were both Fellini movies. One was <strong>The White Sheik </strong>with no familiar names in the cast. The other was <strong>8 1/2 </strong>with Marcello Mastroianni, Anouk Aimee and Claudia Cardinale. After a few days of all sorts of annoyingly cold, rainy weather, today's weather has been very hot and sweltering.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, May 31, 2006: </strong>It's the last day of a pretty nice month. It's the Feast of the Visitation. I'm still trying to keep tabs on my job search. The weather came close to pert near 100 degrees yesterday. My relatives have started making arrangements for their big annual hootenanny in Hilldale next month. All will be total chaos as a million different personalities pretend to be remotely capable of getting along for a few days at a time. I've been having a hard time getting my birth certificate ready so I can get a new Pa. license.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, June 1, 2006: </strong>June is busting out all over. The weather is getting hotter by the second. All is about the same. My job hunt continues. I've been trying to check out the local colleges so I can have both work and school together. Life in the new place is very hectic but in such an especially nice kind of a way.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, June 2, 2oo6: </strong>Today I went for my very first ever Pennsylvania oil change and my very first ever <strong>Jiffy Lube </strong>change instead of <strong>Saturn.</strong> It was on Wyoming Avenue in Kingston. I just finished reading <strong>A Confederacy of Dunces </strong>by John Kennedy Toole. Ignatius Reilly is a combination of St. Thomas Aquinas, Laurel and Hardy and Don Quixote. I just started reading <strong>The Brothers Karamazov </strong>by Fyodor Dostoevski. It's like a semester in an intensely difficult, philosophy, theology classroom.<br /><br /><strong>Saturday, June 3, 2006: </strong>It's raining again. The temperature has dropped from the 90s to the 60s. Yesterday I got my form to fill out for my birth certificate. That's what I have to go through to get a Pa. license. It's the first Saturday of June. My life has been working out so far so smoothly. I miss New York but it's nice here too. Who knows when I shall finally get an answer for my resumes.!?!<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, June 5, 2006: </strong>The weather's not so bad lately. I lost my N.Y. license over the weekend. I've been reading a lot lately. The Mustos came over to eat yeasterday. All went really well. The house is still a total state of confusion though. Life is really quiet around here. Last night I listened to jazz and pop cds. I try to keep as musically eclectic as possible.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, June 6, 2006: </strong>The weather's really nice and warm today. I've still been having trouble with getting my license straightened out for the new state. I have to go to N.Y. in a few days. They have all sorts of rules and regulations out here about ID. It's very frustrating. Last night Mass at <strong>Our Lady of Sorrows </strong>was 7pm instead of the usual 7am it is most days. It's very good when they do that though because that's when they have the prayers to <strong>Our Lady of the Miraculous Medal. </strong>My bedroom door was just put on yesterday and soon will have to be painted.<br /><br /><br /><strong></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, June 7, 2006: </strong>The weather's still really nice and warm today. Last night I read yet another fifty pages of <strong>The Brothers Karamazov. </strong>Dostoyevski is mighty taxing on the brain cells but he's quite educational. Maybe I shall soon have some comments about him on one of my other blogs where I deal with the wide world of the artsy fartsy. Tomorrow I shall be off to New York so I can get my car troubles straightened out. Getting a Pa. license is like applying for a top level high security job.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, June 8, 2006: </strong>Today I'm back at Mary Anne and Steve's in Long Beach. The weather is rainy. On the way over to New York I stopped at <strong>O.L.P.H. </strong>while Burt Koza was drilling the young uns for graduation, I reckon. I came back because of license troubles. It's raining again. Steve promised me one of his Jesuit friends would help me with my job search.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, June 9, 2006: </strong>I'm in Long Beach. Steve helped me send a resume and cover letter to <strong>Scranton University. </strong>Hey let's hope it works out. Maybe later I'll go see Aunt Norma in her new digs. Tomorrow's Jennifer's shower. The kids are really neat and growing up quite well.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, June 10, 2006: </strong>Over at the Caslowitz' place. I'm visiting Mary Anne, Steve and young uns. We're supposed to get ready for Jennifer's shower. The menfolk have our own separate partying to do. The weather is cool judging by the way it feels through this window and my underwear. (Later that day) We spent a nice time partying with Larry while all the womenfolk went to Jennifer's shower at the <strong>Knights of Columbus' Memorare Council </strong>in Seaford. A couple of days ago, she was the birthday girl. There was marvellous food and a splendid time was had by all. Larry had to go shopping for stuff and I ended up going with him like olden times.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Sunday, June 11, 2006: </strong>Many thanks to Sammy for spotting my idiotically obvious mistake about the <strong>Maltese Falcon. </strong>I can't believe I've been out of high school exactly 29 years today. Pretty soon it's off once again to Pa. I hope I can at least make it to Mass. Yesterday's party went well and I didn't end up with a morning after headache. The weather seems nice today.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, June 12, 2oo6: </strong>Well, my big New York (Back back in the New York Groove) weekend is finally and at last over with. Twas neat seeing all my kinfolk. Today I cut the grass. Last night I went to 7p.m. Mass at <strong>St. Anthony of Padua Church </strong>in Exeter. Tonight I go back again for Mass. The weather is really nice these days. In a couple of weeks is the big hoo hah! Over the weekend I got my latest copy of <strong>Latin Mass Magazine. </strong>It's very interesting and educational.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, June 13, 2006: </strong>It's the Feast of St. Anthony, an appropriate day for it. I went to Mass at <strong>St. Anthony of Padua </strong>last night at 7:30. Tonight it's back again for the feast day. Mass is at 7 p.m. I saw most of <strong>Camille </strong>with Greta Garbo, Lionel Barrymore, Robert Taylor. Because of Mass, I was forced to miss the beginning. I also have a copy of the book somewhere. It's by Alexander Dumas <em>fils</em>. Today I went to the dmv to get my license for here. There was all sorts of homeland security bs. to have to contend with. Because of Moslem terrorism everybody has to suffer.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, June 14, 2006: </strong>There are two Carmelite feast days this month. June 7 was the feast of Bl. Anne of St. Bartholomew. Today is the feast of St. Elisha. The weather outside has been getting really groovy. I'm still awaiting word on my resumes. My first druthers would be to get the job Steve helped me to apply for over in Scranton since I'd get quite a kick out of an academic environment. My license circumstances still suck but let's just hope tomorrow will be a more productive day. I'm on a deadline and must get N.Y. plates traded in for Pa. plates within a couple of days.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, June 15, 2006: </strong>Go to Helen Hunt for it. On this day in 1963, the living legend of Helen Hunt was born. I just got extremely bad news at the dmv. I flunked the eye test and now have an appointment scheduled for 2 p.m. this afternoon at an eye doctor. I haven't worn glasses since the ninth grade. Mr. Morabito, who was then my biology teacher, wanted to know why I stopped wearing them.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, June 16: 2006: </strong>I went to Dr. Jason Smith of Forty Fort to get my eyes checked. Great Caesar's freakin Ghost!! My eyesight is 20-200 in my left eye and 20-30 in the right. I need bifocals to get a license. They're for driving, reading and computer stuff. Oh the curse of us bookworms!!! Last night, I watched Luis Bunuel's <strong>The Exterminating Angel. </strong>I should suppose you could say it was very <strong>Twilight Zone-y.</strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, June 17, 2006: </strong>Today I went to my second Pennsylvania Carmelite meeting in Wilkes-Barre. There were three new women there. There were also coffee and snacks at the meeting. First we prayed the Lectio Divina and Liturgy of the Hours from the breviary. After the meeting we went to Mass in the chapel and said the Rosary before it started. Tonight is the big party. It will be nice to be able to see the kinfolk. We're getting that much closer to the big annual gang thang.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, June 19, 2006: </strong>Yesterday was Father's' Day. Many kudos to all who qualify. It was very busy around here because of all the company. Heat stroke weather has finally and at last arrived. As of today I now finally and at last wear glasses again. My bifocals are a hoot. I'm having an interesting time getting used to them. Because I can't see well enough without them they're necessary for driving. <strong>When I'm Sixty Four: </strong>Yesterday Beatle Paul McCartney turned sixty four years old. Everyone enjoyed the festivities I suppose. It's too bad he's getting a divorce.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, June 20, 2006: </strong>Last night I saw Joan Crawford's <strong>Mildred Pierce, </strong>featuring Eve <strong>(The Mothers In Law) </strong>Arden and Ann Blyth. There were no other familiar names in the cast but I recognized a few other really familiar faces and voices. Lately the heat wave's been a for really and for truly scorcher. In a couple of weeks is the big she_ bang in Hilldale. Last night I went to 7 p.m. Mass at <strong>Our Lady of Sorrows. </strong>Today the library opened an hour later than usual.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, June 21, 2006: </strong>Yesterday, in a raging thunderstorm( so a few minutes of it got blacked out) I saw <strong>Casablanca. </strong>It starred Humphrey Bogart, Sidney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre (only a short time after <strong>The Maltese Falcon</strong>), as well as Ingrid Bergman, Paul Heinreid, Claude Rains, and Dooley Wilson as Sam. The film, most especially in its last 15 minutes was a veritable bottomless pit of movie cliches and one liners galore. Today is cousin Larry's birthday. He's (ahem) a smidge older than I, shall we say? I now have my Pa. license in my possession finally and at last fully equipped with my very first ever picture of me as an adult with glasses-bifocals, yet. My new plate is on my car. Hey in case any of you know Jo Anne and her family-she's that little red haired girl-they're on their way to California.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, June 22,2006: </strong>Last night I finally went to my very first ever Pa. <strong>KofC</strong> meeting. The council is the <strong>Assumpta Council 3987 </strong>at 59 Parry Street. I met all new people there and I'm fully expecting things to work out really well for me. I got there very easily but driving home I went nuts. The side street I started out on has too many twists and turns for me so I went on Rte. 309. Today I have a bit of a headache.<br /><br /><strong>Friday, June 23, 2006: </strong>Today is the Feast of the <strong>Sacred Heart. </strong>Ordinarily tomorrow should have been the Obligatory Memorial of the <strong>Immaculate Heart of Mary</strong> but the Solemnity of <strong>St. John the Baptist </strong>outranks it on the Church's liturgical calendar. The sucky weather seems to have left us alone for a while. My nephew Michael went to his senior prom last night. His high school graduation party is over the weekend. So far everythings's been working out really well for him. Yesterday I heard from Mary Anne from the<strong> Carmelites</strong> and Wayne from the <strong>Knights of Columbus. </strong>I've been getting really involved with them.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, June 24, 2006: </strong>We're back in Long Beach again. Tomorrow is Michael's big day. Even Sam has gotten a haircut. Everybody's been really busy over here. It rained throughout most of the trip, to my total chagrin. Sam and Bridget aree both watching TV right next to me. I'm looking forward to the big weekend.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, June 26, 2006: </strong>All went well for Michael over in Long Beach yesterday. Many congratulations to the new high school graduate. It's been absolutely pouring constantly lately. The weather is nightmarishly boring and annoying. Dave came over to fix the new dishwasher. Speaking of nightmarishly boring and annoying, The big annual 4th of July shindig is coming up in a few days. I went to 7p.m. Mass last night at <strong>St. Anthony of Padua </strong>in Exeter because it was the only one I was available for. <strong>This week in Lindenhurst history: </strong>On June 24, 1891, the name of Breslau, N.Y., was officially changed to Lindenhurst.<br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, June 27, 2006: </strong>I just got a reminder, on one of my e mails, that today is the Feast of <strong>Our Lady Of Perpetual Help. </strong>Of course, it was in Italian, so I'm not absolutely positive of everything it said. Today is absolutely pouring out. Flooding is everywhere. It's one not necessarily for the record books but most certainly for the news headlines. Coming up any day now is the big annual Hillldale shindig. It's what puts the boonies on the map once a year. A splendid time is guaranteed for all. Of course, I'm still adjusting to my new glasses. I feel as if I've wandered into a reunion of the <strong>Byrds</strong> or <strong>Jefferson Airplane</strong>. I went to 7:30 p.m. Mass last night at <strong>St. Anthony of Padua.</strong> Will <strong>The Brothers Karamazov </strong>ever end or what?<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, June 28, 2006: </strong>Tonight is my big<strong> KofC </strong>meeting over in Luzerne's council. I'll go nuts in an entirely unfamiliar area if the weather's anywhere near as sucky as last night. It's for the fourth degree. I still have to get some unavoidably mandatory paperwork done. The big weekend is well nigh upon us. It poured so much last night it was pert near as if we seemed to have been forced to relive the big flood of 1972. Bridges were washed out and there were all sorts of flooding and accidents. The phones, because of fallen cables, are all gone until further notice.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, June 30, 2006: </strong>Lately the biggest Pa. flood since <strong>Hurrican Agnes </strong>in '72's been running the entire show around here. The phone was out for four days. The Wyoming Bridge on 8th street is still closed down. Wednesday night the area was stuck with an 8 p.m. curfew and I couldn't make my 4th degree meeting. On Wednesday, I watched <strong>The Loved One, </strong>the 1965 movie based on <strong>Evelyn Waugh's </strong>novel. It's an extremely seriously warped (hey remember this is the mid 1960's here) film starring <strong>Robert Morse, Anjanette Comer, </strong>and a veritable plethora of 1960's show business icons. This weekend is the big Hilldale she bang.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, July 1, 2006: </strong>Well, it's finally and at last here. I know Gary, Maria and their kids have made it in. Elaine is here and so is Anthony. Mary Anne, Steve and Michael got in but Sam lucked out and went on a really interesting trip for a bar mitzvah. The weather's nice and hot even though it rained-major thunderstorm, that is-yesterday. Mary Anne and Bridget came in 9:30 a.m. yesterday just as I was getting home from my walk. Steve and Michael got in last night.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, July 5, 2oo6: </strong>Well, folks, I reckon the big Hilldale she bang is finally over and out for yet a whole nother year. It was very nice to be able to see that Batman &amp; Robin both made it. Larry, Gary, Frankie, Steve, Richie & I appeared to have neglected to pack our guitars and accordions. The Ronald showed up all chalk full of <a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k=old%20navy">old navy</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=old%20navy">old navy</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=old%20navy">old navy</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=old%20navy">old navy</a> (military, not retail chain) stories.

I'm still waiting around for news about a job. I applied at that school and on Wednesday I have to take a civil service test in Scranton. I hope it works out with one or the other of them or even the employment agency. Until then I keep busy with my many anonymous blogs. This has been a very busy birthday month. All sorts of birthdays keep sneaking up on us. Next Friday I have to go to a Carmelite meeting. Yesterday on the phone I heard from Wayne from the <strong>KofC. </strong>I should have stuck around for the meeting a few nights ago but to everyone's chagrin I left.</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Monday, July 10, 2006: </strong>Over the course of the past few days, I watched <strong>Mysterious Island </strong>(with Herbert) and <strong>Heaven Can Wait </strong>(Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Buck Henry, Dyan Cannon and all sorts of 70s stars.) The weather's been warm lately and last night was a very big thunderstorm. There's only 2 more days to go until my big test- civil service, that is. All the churches around here are making changes because of priest shortages.</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Tuesday, July 11, 2006: </strong>Ugh!! Tomorrow is my big civil service test over in Scranton. Today must be a veritable bane thereof of liberals everywhere because it is the Feast of St. Benedict of Nursia, a namesake of Pope Benedict XVI and a co-patron of Europe. He founded the western monastic tradition which contributed so much to the beauty of western culture. Last night, I watched <strong>Tom Jones. </strong>I also finished-yes, finally and at last-<strong>The Brothers Karamazov </strong>and have moved on to Flannery O'Connor's <strong>Wise Blood. </strong>That's the one the liberals don't like because it frequently repeats the n word. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Wednesday, July 12, 2006: </strong>The test is finally and at last over with. It was pouring out over the course of the night. The weather was a smidge better by the time I took the test though. It was in Scranton. It's most certainly not as if I've never been throught one before. It's odd because in New York well over 150 people at a time show up for it. Out here, though, there were fewer than twenty of us. Most New York applicants are black, Hispanic, Asian, etc. but most of these characters were white. It was still an extremely seriously annoying test, unfortunately. I ate pizza today so it wasn't an all bad day.</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Thursday, July 13, 2oo6: </strong>After an altogether too long period of rainstorms-I just can't even try to stand it anymore-it's finally and at last starting to show some signs of being at least for now a fairly nice day. I still await news about whether or not I shall get one of those jobs. I'm a-rootin for the one at the <strong>University</strong><strong> of Scranton's</strong> library of course but hey for now I should just keep my eyes and ears peeled. Whatever happened to that temporary agency is entirely beyond me. Today I went over to the church's rectory to get my envelopes. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><br /><br /><strong>Friday, July 14, 2006: </strong>It started out miserably foggy and now it's a real scorcher.

Last night I watched the Elizabeth Taylor classic,<strong> Butterfield 8. </strong>It also starred Eve Arden, Eddie Fisher(a former Mr. Elizabeth Taylor), Laurence Harvey, Dina Merrill, Susan Oliver and Kay Medford. I keep racking up those 60's classics and old movies in general. I keep waiting to hear about one of those jobs I applied for. Meanwhile all sorts of other things have to be done. I go back to Wilkes Barre tomorrow for a Carmelite meeting. <strong></strong><br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, July 15, 2006: </strong>It's raining again(everybody sing the Supertramp song). I was out early today to the Carmelite meeting even though it's a Franciscan feast day(St. Bonaventure of Bagnoregio). Tomorrow, because of its being a Sunday, the feast of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel will not be celebrated. While at the Little Flower Residence I found out about yesterday's job fair so I made sure I picked up an application. I made a mistake and ended up having to come home by way of a route that's other than the one I've gotten used to by now. It was a neat change of pace. I swear the roads around here go around in circles.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, July 17, 2006: </strong>Since Saturday, we've been having a veritable heat wave. Last night I saw<strong> Foreign Correspondent. </strong>The only familiar names in the cast are Robert Benchley, Laraine Day and Alfred Hitchcock in an uncredited bit part. Alas, I still await word on job-wise circumstances. I have to get in touch with the Little Flower to find out what openings they have. It doesn't pay to bother to apply for anything I can't get anyway. Life around here has been getting nicer every day but I have to lose weight. The local parishes are still undergoing a shakedown.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Tuesday, July 18, 2006: </strong>The by now aggravating heat wave is still out of control. My car, of course, has no air conditioning so I'm especially peeved whenever I have to drive anyplace. I spoke to someone from the Little Flower Home and she said there were no openings other than laundry people, floor people and nurses' aides. Shucks and wazoo. At least my Friday dance is gaining in popularity. For that I get all sorts of feedback. I've been trying to build up traffic on my blogs by visiting other sites and advertising. I've become one of those compulsive characters. Lately I've been reading Charles Dickens' <strong>The Pickwick Papers. </strong>I'll have to tell you all about it pretty soon. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Wednesday, July 19, 2006: </strong>Pennsylvania's most distinguished native son celebrated his 100th birthday yesterday. <strong>Mr. Peanut, </strong>the one and only ace boon legume, is still most certainly quite the handsome guy for his age. There was a peanut parade but the chunky's are boycotting it because the creamy's didn't want them to march. The grand marshall is a member of the loyal order of fluffernutters.<br /></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><br /><strong>Thursday, July 20, 2006: </strong>Alas, the world of the arts has sustained a great and irreparable loss. Recently, we mourned the death of <strong>Red "Never Got a Dinner" Buttons. </strong>The Borscht Belt/Catskills, movie , tv, etc. comedian died at the age of 88. Tomorrow we have to do the Friday peanut dance. For practice, go to:<a href="http://www.planters.com/dancing">http://www.planters.com/dancing</a> Maybe that will help us overcome all the heatstroke. I've heard that my old stomping grounds, New York, was recently under threat of a hurricane. Let's hope it doesn't happen.<br /></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Friday, July 21, 2006: </strong>Hey, are we all doing the Friday peanut dance really well by now or what? Yesterday, my parents and I finally and at last got around to making that long promised trip to the <strong>St. Anne's Passionist Monastery </strong>in Scranton, Pa. It's an easy trip and it's during the novena for the feast of Sts. Joachim and Anne. Up until then, I'd only visited the Passionists in Connecticut and New York City. Sweltering heat and thunderstorms are stilll the order of each day around here, alas. I'm still trying to pick up as much mileage as possible for my blogs. My <a href="http://www.wheresgeorge.com">http://www.wheresgeorge.com</a> stats even seem to be picking up lately too. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Saturday, July 22, 2006: </strong>My old parish, <strong>Our Lady of Perpetual Help, </strong>in Lindenhurst, N.Y. , recently held a very successful annual feast between July 12 and 16. Their five ethnic nights were: Polish, Irish, Italian, U.S. and German. For all the groovy pictures go to<a href="http://www.olphlindenhurst.org/feastphotos.htm">http://www.olphlindenhurst.org/feastphotos.htm</a> Monsignor Daniel S. Hamilton and company-Knights of Columbus, Holy Name Society beer salesmen, etc. -must have gone pert near stark raging nuts without my indispensible assistance-HA!HA!-but somehow a most splendid time seemed to have been had by all.<br /></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Monday, July 24, 2006: </strong>The heat wave seems to have subsided a smidge, at least yesterday was a bit on the way cool side. Today, too, shows signs of being a bit cooler than average. I"ve been doing pretty well lately with<strong> The Pickwick Papers. </strong>I'm still hoping for signs of better luck with <a href="http://www.wheresgeorge.com">http://www.wheresgeorge.com</a> Where has all that money gone? I know it has to be out there somewhere. Other people even get hits in foreign countries. I'm stuck with all the local yokels. Drinking cold water and waiting for bites from my resumes is the order of the day. Yesterday I saw the Hitchcock classic <strong>Suspicion. </strong>It included Cary(Judy, Judy, Judy) Grant, Joan Fontaine, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Dame May Whitty, Nigel(Dr. Watson, I presume) Bruce, Leo G. (Waverly from <strong>The Man from U.N.C.L.E) </strong>Carroll, and Hitchcock. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Tuesday, July 25, 2006: </strong>Last night I watched the Sherlock Holmes classic, <strong>The Woman In Green. </strong>It starred Basil Rathbone, Nigel Bruce, Hillary(of Abbott &amp; Costello fame)Brooke, and Eve Amber. Right after that I saw the movie version of Graham Greene's classic novel, <strong>The Third Man. </strong>It starred Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, Wilfrid Hyde-White, Lee Strasberg, and just plain Valli. </div><div align="left">This morning, shortly after 7a.m. Mass at St. Cecelia's in Exeter, I went to the Department of Labor in Wilkes Barre and got another resume together so I can get into their files in hopes of getting a job. It's still hot here but cooler than a few days ago. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Wednesday, July 26, 2006: </strong>Last night, I watched <strong>My Favorite Brunette,</strong> with Bob Hope, Dorothy Lamour, Peter Lorre, Lon Chaney, Jr., Bing Crosby and Alan Ladd. Today, thanks to Anne M., I sent in a resume to Geisinger Medical Center in Wilkes Barre. The heat is still out of control. Drink lots of very cold water. Those sudoku puzzles might be a nice distraction from the weather. They drive me nuts.<br /></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Thursday, July 27, 2006: </strong>Last night, to my chagrin, I missed most of Herman's Hermits' <strong>Mrs. Brown You've Got A Lovely Daughter </strong>but at least I got a chance to see <strong>Bonnie and Clyde </strong>with Warren Beatty, Faye Dunaway, Michael J. Pollard, Gene Hackman, Denver Pyle, Dub Taylor, Estelle Parsons, Gene Wilder and the interestingly named Evans Evans. A couple of these people were really familiar fixtures on 60's hillbilly TV comedies. Michael J. Pollard is he consummate nerd boy. Yesterday and today are both entirely too hot for me and on top of that I just cut the grass.</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Friday, July 28, 2006: </strong>Last night I could have watched <strong>Cleopatra, </strong>starring Elizabeth Taylor, Richard Burton, Rex Harrison and a cast of thousands of other 60's icons but hey puuh leeese! It started at 8p.m. and went on for over four hours!! I hope to see it some other time. The heat wave still goes on and yesterday I spent pert near the whole day with a headache, sick and tired. My California connection, Cathleen, says people over there are stuck with hundred (at least) degree heat waves. On top of that I need a haircut but enjoy driving people nuts with my hippie image. Right before I got to the library I got gas. Hey at least it's about fitty cent less expensive here than in NY.<br /></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Saturday, July 29, 2006: </strong>The heat wave just goes on and on. Last night I finally got a chance to see my very first ever-yes, folks, finally and at last!!-Brigitte Bardot movie. As everyone knows by now, she was John Lennon's ideal woman. I saw <strong>A Very Private Affair. </strong>It featured, besides Bardot, Marcello Mastroianni, and Louis Malle, who was also the director. I have been trying to keep reading and watching old movies. Hey, one never knows when it will come in handy especially since I don't happen to like sports. When I get a chance to meet new people around here, I'll at least have something to say.<br /></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Monday, July 31, 2006: </strong>A full thirty five years ago tomorrow was the legendary <strong>Concert for Bangla Desh, </strong>starring Beatle George Harrison and featuring Beatle Ringo Starr, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Billy Preston and Leon Russell. It was great musically but alas it started the boring ball rolling for all those pop star fundraisers to come. <a href="http://www.theconcertforbangladesh.com">http://www.theconcertforbangladesh.com</a> Today's a real scorcher, a continuation of the heat wave, much as Martha Reeves & the Vandellas and Linda Ronstadt warned us of. This morning I just finished <strong>The Pickwick Papers </strong>all waspy and nice and I've just started Tom Wolfe's hippie counter-cultural classic <strong>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. </strong>It's a veritable testament to 60's flower power and hippiedom. Dylan, Ken Kesey, the Grateful Dead, Jack Kerouac all wander in and out of its pages. Movie-wise, I saw Humphrey Bogart's <strong>High Sierra </strong>on Saturday. Ida Lupino, Barton (<strong>I Dream of Jeannie)</strong> Maclane, Cornel Wilde, Paul Harvey, and Zero the Dog (as Pard) were in it. Last night, I saw <strong>Dark Passage, </strong>also with Bogart. This one included Lauren Bacall, and Agnes (<strong>Bewitched)</strong> Moorehead. Finally, I saw Bette Davis' <strong>Jezebel. </strong>Also appearing were Henry(<strong>The Smith Family) </strong>Fonda, Spring (<strong>That Girl)</strong>Byington, and-lest we presume to forget-both Rochester and Stymie. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Tuesday, August 1, 2006: </strong>Last night I saw <strong>One Way Passage, </strong>with William Powell and Kay Francis, <strong>Confession </strong>with Kay Francis and Basil Rathbone, and <strong>Captain Blood, </strong>based on the classic Rafael Sabatini novel, with Errol Flynn, Olivia (still alive!!!) de Havilland, Basil Rathbone, Guy Kibbee, Vernon(Three Stooges, Laurel &amp; Hardy) Steele and of course, lest we forget, good old Stymie. I've also been getting very heavily into <strong>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test. </strong>Welcome back to 1965. Today's just about the worst day of the heat wave. The librarian told somebody he expects 100 degree temperature. Yesterday, in the mail I got the Tidings from my N.Y. council. I'll have to tell you tomorrow about what's in it. I really enjoy keeping track of the old gang. Tomorrow I have to say hello and happy birthday to cousins Fran and Elaine. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Wednesday, August 2, 2006: </strong>A happy birthday hoo ha to Fran and Elaine. Yesterday I saw Angela Lansbury's <strong>The Three Musketeers. </strong>It also starred Vincent Price, Gig Young, Gene Kelly,Lana Turner, June Allyson, and other notables of that era.. After that, there was Lansbury's <strong>The Manchurian Candidate. </strong>It starred Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, John McGiver, and other notables from that era. Today I saw <strong>A Girl In Ever Port,</strong>with a brotherless Groucho Marx, William Bendix, Don Defore, Teddy Hart from the <strong>Our Gang Comedies</strong> and others from that era. The weather's still too hot and today may be the worst. Tonight I go to a KofC meeting. My New York council is having an Americana music night, trips to Spain(well I never been to Spain but I been to Pennsylvania) and Foxwood, a fishing trip and a golf outing. </div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><strong>Thursday, August 3, 2oo6: </strong>Last night I went over to say happy birthday to Fran. Yesterday I watched <strong>The Big Store, </strong>with the Marx Brothers, Margaret Dumont and Charles Lane, a regular on comedies and dramas ever since anybody can remember. He is 101 years old and still among the living. I also saw<strong> Room Service </strong>with The Marx Brothers, Ann Miller, Lucille Ball and, oddly, no Margaret Dumont. Then there was <strong>Monkey Business </strong>with Thelma Todd, Maurice Chevalier, Rolfe Sedan but alas, no Margaret Dumont. I've been trying to become as knowledgeable as possible about old movies. The heat wave still goes on. I missed last night's KofC meeting because of it. My car has no <a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k=air%20conditioner">air conditioner</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=air%20conditioner">air conditioner</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=air%20conditioner">air conditioner</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=air%20conditioner">air conditioner</a>. Lately it's to hot to take a walk through the neighborhood. I still check my job applications regularly. <strong>The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test </strong>is finished and I've started Thackeray's <strong>Vanity Fiar. </strong>It's longer but less bizarre.</div><div align="left"></div><strong></strong><br /><br /><strong>Friday, August 4, 2006: </strong>Last night I watched my very first ever movie with either Veronica Lake or Fredric March in it. I saw <strong>I Married A Witch. </strong>I suppose it may have been the inspiration for TV's <strong>Bewitched.</strong> Besides them, Robert Benchley, Susan Hayward and many others were in it. The weather's a smidge cooler today. I tried driving to a gas station in Kingston last night and went nuts. It was pouring for a while when I got home. I found out in the Citizen's Voice that St. Anthony of Padua's blood drive is next Wednesday.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, August 5, 2006: </strong>Last night my father and I went to the first Friday/ Saturday Mass and holy hour at the Oblates of St. Joseph Seminary on Rte. 315 in Yatesville. Before that I watched a retrospective episode of <strong>Seinfeld. </strong>Yada yada yada. Did you know that Jerry Seinfeld will be at the Kirby Center around here on my next birthday!!? Wow!!! I reckon that's just about pert near the plum highlight of HIS career huh? I cut the grass this morning so even though the weather's about 30 degrees cooler than it's been lately(my windshield got fogged up-oh behave!!!)I worked up quite a sweat.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, August 7, 2006: </strong>Last night I wathched a couple of movies that are awfully recent by my standards: I saw <strong>Fat Albert </strong>with Kenan Thompson and Bill Cosby<strong> </strong>and <strong>The Godfather </strong>with Marlon Brando, Talia Shire, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and even the living(yes to this very day even) legend of Abe <strong>(Fish) </strong>Vigoda among very many other 70s luminaries<strong>. </strong>Saturday night, I pigged out on entirely too much Chinese food. That night I got a bad headache that came back last night.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, August 8, 2006: </strong>Today has been very cool so far. I can, finally and at last, breathe in my car. The temperature up until now has yet to go past 70 degrees. Unfortunately, Marie S., a very old friend of the family, died on Sunday morning and I have to make sure I show up at her wake later today. Over the course of the past few months, I've been becoming quite a blog addict and have been looking for ways to advertise my blogs so they can get lots of attention and generate lots of traffic. Never having been a fan of the telephone I suppose this internet fascination of mine is how I've been making up the difference.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, August 9, 2006: </strong>Yesterday I went to Marie S's wake in West Pittston. Today I went to her funeral at the Methodist church in Plains. It was very sad because she was such a very good person. I got a chance, finally and at last, to say hello to all her kids, Sandra, Rick, Sharon and Jean Marie(Gina), whom I had not seen-and always wanted to- since our very early days many decades ago. It's too bad I couldn't have met them under nicer circumstances. At least the weather's most certainly been cooling down around here. May the heat wave be only really mild from now on.<br /><br /><strong>Thursday, August 10, 2006: </strong>Today is my younger sister Mary Anne's 43 birthday. Nothing much is happening these days except for relief from the recent heat wave. We're gearing up for two upcoming kinfolk weddings. I'm absolutely exhausted and woke up at 3 a.m. with an extremely seriously annoying headache. Maybe it's because yesterday I showed up for a funeral and gave blood. At least the headache is gone.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, August 11, 2006: </strong>Last night I saw <strong>Force of Evil </strong>and <strong>He Ran All the Way</strong> both with John Garfield. Yesterday I got an appointment to go to a postal service job interview next Thursday morning in Pittston. Nothing much else is new. The weather's nice and all is so far so good. I walk a few days a week.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, August 12, 2006: </strong>A groovy birthday is wished for Uncle Frankie(today) and cousin Mary Ellen(tomorrow). Today is also cousin Java and Nunziata's 33 anniversary. That's the lima bean anniversary I think. This morning according to what Anne M. specifically told me on the phone last night I was supposed to meet her at the Little Flower Manor and go to someplace south of there for a day of recollection. Oddly, though, nobody showed up. I hung around a while and left. the highest number of page views I've gotten on any of my blogs so far on ny one day is 97 on August 10 for my modblog.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, August 14, 2006: </strong>Last night I saw two Neil Simon movies. One was<strong> The Odd Couple </strong>with Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, and an all star cast of 70s famous people. I also saw <strong>Plaza Suite </strong>in which Matthau played three separate roles and it also included an all star cast. Cathleen, my usual e mail connection, is not available today and was not available on Friday either. The weekend was pretty quiet with no major jolt in circumstances. On Thursday, I have to go to my postal interview. DUh.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, August 15, 2oo6: </strong>Yesterday I watched the famous <strong>Weekend at the Waldorf</strong><br />with Lana Turner, Walter Pidgeon, Ginger Rogers and Leon (<strong>Mr. Ed) </strong>Ames. The week has been going so far so well. No major catastrophes have struck just yet. The weather is cooler and even the price of gas has been going down a smidge lately. Alas, I haven't been doing enough walking lately and it's starting to show in the old labonza.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, August 16, 2006: </strong>Today is the anniversary of Elvis Presley's death and Woodstock. Lately I watched <strong>The Lost Squadron </strong>with Richard Dix, Mary Astor and Joel McCrea; <strong>Sky Giant </strong>with Richard Dix and Joan Fontaine; and <strong>Citizen Kane </strong>with Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten, Ruth Warrick, Agnes Moorehead and Nat King Cole. Tomorrow is my big day at the Pittston P.O. My <a href="http://www.modblog.com">www.modblog.com</a> stats have finally been going through the roof.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, August 17, 2006: </strong>I'm so deliriously happy to be able to say that yesterday my <a href="http://www.modblog.com">www.modblog.com</a> site hit an all-time high-and I only started it around the end of May-of 143 unique visitors and_oh yeah, I lie to you not_552 page views. This morning, at 9:30 a.m. I sat through an interview at the Pittston Post Office on Dock Street, with six other guys. The postmaster, a woman, interviewed us all together. It was a nice fifteen minutes. New York P.O.s have very many more people at these things. Right within eyeshot of the place are a Knights of Columbus council and a Burger King. Hey, while you happen to be in Pittston, I should hope for your sake you don't even think of neglecting to stop at the twenty third annual Pittston Tomato Festival today through the 20th. It even includes a tomato fight($5 fee of course) at 1:30 p.m. on Saturday. <a href="http://www.pittstontomatofestival.com">www.pittstontomatofestival.com</a> Here's my inevitable trivia contribution: The original word, in English, for tomato, was "Belladonna". Literally, in Latin, that means "Beautiful woman". Obviously, then, it makes perfectly good sense, that a woman who is a real looker is often called a tomato.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, August 18, 2006: </strong>Happy Friday, cha cha cha. Yesterday I saw two Carole Lombard Films. First, there was <strong>The Princess Comes Across </strong>with William(<strong>I Love Lucy) </strong>Frawley and Fred <strong>(My Three Sons) </strong>MacMurray. Then there was <strong>Love Before Breakfast </strong>with Caesar<strong>(Batman)</strong>Romero. This morning, before three a.m. I woke up with a headache. Maybe the traditional Friday dance will cure it for me. This morning, I even noticed that this blog has been getting mileage. Having not budged from 124 hits for quite a while it now has gotten 145. I just finished <strong>Vanity Fair </strong>and have started Graham Greene's <strong>The Power and the Glory. </strong><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Saturday, August 19, 2006: </strong>Yesterday I saw three Bela Lugosi movies. There were <strong>Zombies on Broadway </strong>with Wally Brown and Alan Carney, Sheldon Leonard and Sir Lancelot; <strong>Genius at Work </strong>with Wally Brown and Alan Carney: and <strong>You'll Find Out </strong>with Kay Kyser and his band featuring the legendary Ish Kabibble, as well as Peter Lorre and Boris Karloff. Hey, somebody from <strong>O.L.P.H. </strong>appears to have visited another blog of mine recently. Today was my Carmelite meeting and tomorrow is another day of recollection.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Monday, August 21, 2006: Funny Face</strong>, starring Audrey Hepburn, Fred Astaire and Ruta Lee, was the last movie I watched. Yesterday I went to St. Martha's Church in Stillwater, Pa. It was for a Lay Carmelite day of recollection. Fr. Joe Kakareka was in charge. There were also secular (discalced) Carmelites there from Elysburg. The scenery in that part of the Poconos is exceptionally nice. It's an entirley rural area. Besides the real livestock the farmers even have fake livestock.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Tuesday, August 22, 2006: </strong>Yesterday I watched <strong>Please Don't Eat the Daisies </strong>with Doris Day, David Niven, Madge<strong>(Batman)</strong>Blake, Janis Paige and lots of other old timers from that era. Jennifer and Joe's wedding's coming up. I guess that means it's haircut time again. The weather's hot but it's manageable. My blog stats are going through the roof. Even this one has 167 hits. My hay fever stinks but it's been worse.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Wednesday, August 23, 2006: </strong>Tomorrow's the big day. I get to go back to New York for a wedding. Larry and Rose's daughter Jennifer is marrying Joe. Today I even got a haircut right by the Wyoming Bridge at a little shopping center. The place is run by a woman named Rose. August is winding down and the weather is still warm. My car still has no air conditioning but that's the only disadvantage.<br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Thursday, August 24, 2006: </strong>Once again, I'm visiting Mary Anne and Steve and the kids. It's time for Michael's <a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a><a href="><a style="><a href="http://eastelmhurst.blogspot.com/ onmouseout="><a href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k=birthday%20party">birthday party</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=birthday%20party">birthday party</a></a>'; return true;" style="BORDER-BOTTOM: 3px double; TEXT-DECORATION: none" onmouseout="window.status=''; return true;" href="http://www.serverlogic3.com/lm/rtl3.asp?si=22&k;=birthday%20party">birthday party</a>_yesterday he turned eighteen. This weekend is Jennifer and Joe's wedding. It's nice being back in New York for a change. I'll be able to give Gary and Elaine their fudge.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Friday, August 25, 2006: </strong>Today is nice but Steve says he and Mark can't take the young uns on the boat because according to <a href="http://www.weather.com">www.weather.com</a> there's a 60% chance of rain and it's not worth the trouble. Tomorrow's the big day for Jennifer and Joe. I spent all of yesterday afternoon and last night with and awfully annoying headache. Sdvil and Ibuprofen didn't help. It turned out to be one of those kinds I just have to wait out.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><br /><a href="http://www.smileycentral.com/?partner=ZSzeb068_ZNxdm801YYUS" target="_blank"><img src="http://www.smileycentral.com/sig.jsp?pc=ZSzeb068&amp;pp=ZNxdm801YYUS" border="0" /></a></div><div align="left"></div>
