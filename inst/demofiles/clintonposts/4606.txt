<p>In what starts out to be a feeble attempt at an adoring puff piece by Time Magazine whose main focus is to paint Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi as a kindly, polite, but tough fighting politician, Time went too far and exposed the old biddy for what she really is - a dimwit and vengeful old bag who couldn't care less about America.  Here are some morsels:</p>

<blockquote>The 66-year-old San Francisco lawmaker is an aggressive, hyperpartisan liberal pol who is the Democrats' version of Tom DeLay, minus the ethical and legal problems of the former Republican House leader.</blockquote>

<p>But is isn't very difficult to find examples of her (or her close associates') unethical behavior.  <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/4/5/110157.shtml">For example, this report</a>:</p>

<blockquote>In what pundits are calling a quid pro quo for her hard line on the ethics of House Majority Leader Tom Delay, R-Texas, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is under fire for an adviserâs nine-day, $4,475 junket to Spain and Germany last April, a trip primarily paid for by a nonprofit transportation-research organization Pelosi had helped to secure Federal Transit Administration monies, according to a report in the Washington Times.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/national/20050504-122024-4420r.htm">Or this report</a>:</p>

<blockquote> Mr. Dicks said earlier this week that a five-day trip he took to Miami this year was paid for by a defense lobbying firm without his knowledge. Upon learning that Alexandria-based Spectrum Group had paid some of the expenses, Mr. Dicks offered to pay the $985 out of pocket, his spokesman said. 
    Mr. Thompson and Mr. Clyburn got embroiled in the ethics battle when the Associated Press discovered documents showing that their travels in 1997 to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) had been paid for by a lobbyist. 
    That lobbyist, Jack Abramoff, is under federal investigation and has been at the heart of questions surrounding travel by Mr. DeLay. Despite evidence showing that Mr. Abramoff paid for travel by Mr. DeLay, the Texas Republican said he never knowingly allowed any lobbyist to pay for his trips.</blockquote>
    
Again, from Time...

<blockquote>in a 1996 interview with the San Francisco Chronicle said, "I pride myself in being called a liberal" and "I don't consider myself a moderate." </blockquote>

<p>That statement speaks volumes.  As you move more toward the left - where she claims to be - the number of Democrats who you can count on for support dwindle quickly.  The Democrat revulsion for the Bell Curve doesn't mean it isn't real - and this is a perfect example of its reality.  That far-left stance is going to cost her and her party big numbers of moderate voters who think of people like Michael Moore, Cindy Sheehan, and John Murtha when they think "Liberals."</p>

<p>Time adds...</p>

<blockquote>Still, some Democrats think Pelosi's leftward tilt, combined with her strident attacks on Bush, undercuts her strength as a party leader. A number of Democratic candidates have distanced themselves from her. "We hope she campaigns in as many districts as possible," said Ron Bonjean, spokesman for Dennis Hastert, the Republican Speaker of the House. "She comes across as very liberal."</blockquote>

<p>As a general rule, if your opponents are cheering you on, you are doing something wrong.  And addressing her dingbat public pronouncements = which have been many - Time says:</p>

<blockquote>The charitable view of her often disjointed speaking style is that she's someone who thinks faster than she talks. The uncharitable view is that "she's Teresa Heinz without the accent," as one Democratic activist said.</blockquote>

<p>Pelosi herself puts the cherry on the whipped cream with her assessment of what would likely happen were the Democrats to gain a majority in November (not a likely outcome):</p>

<blockquote>It would also be a test of Pelosi's skills: she has unified the Democrats in opposition, but it would be much more difficult to keep Democratic members in line if they took control. "They listen to no one," says Pelosi. "They don't listen to each other."</blockquote>

<p>I would add, after listening to Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, and Joe Biden, they don't even listen to themselves.  Pelosi is a dingy old bag whose time has come and gone.  She will fade quickly after this election and nobody will much care.</p>
