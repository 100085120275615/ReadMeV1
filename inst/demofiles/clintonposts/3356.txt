<div>Just saw a report from Iraq where a Tennis coach and thwo team memebrs, one Sunni and Two Shite, were executed by Islamic extremists because they were warned not to wear shot pants and did anyway. According to the report, leaflets were spread sometime last week warning against this atrocity (wearing shorts). I wonder if they got the memo? I actually hope they did get it and were just ballsy enough to wear the shorts anyway just to piss the ignorant fuckers off! Where is the congressional outrage? Where are all the hollywood wanna-be's crying out against this? Where is Hillary and her stupid shit? I guess they agree with the extremists.</div>
