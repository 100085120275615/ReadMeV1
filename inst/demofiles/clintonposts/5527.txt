Once upon a Clinton administration, it was conservatives who especially despised Mrs. Clinton.  Yes, they hated her husband, but they seemed to find the First Ladyâs own power moves very un-lady like.<br /><br />It seemed unfair, to me, to read such grotesquely biased books about her as the one written by Peggy Noonan with the title, âThe Case Against Hillary Clintonâ. Then Ed Klein wrote, âThe Truth About Hillary Clintonâ. What were these right wing critics doing attacking the personal character of Hilary when all she wanted was to help the poor and get health care reformed?<br /><br />But now Iâve had enough of Mrs. Clinton as well. Iâve always questioned whether she was really married to Bill Clinton, and now I realize she is not. She is really <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?pid=108775">Mrs. Joe Lieberman</a>.  Her support of the $200 million dollar-a-day Iraq war, refusing to take a strong stand against this irrational invasion and occupation, is infuriating. <br /><br />This is what drives potential supporters of the Democratic Party crazy! It is a party of actors that is constantly trying to find its best mark on the political stage and ends up delivering only embarrassing performances.  It is the party of the <span>third</span> way, Bill Clinton, that only he could pull off. But when Kerry, Gore, Lieberman and Mrs. Clinton emulate the neo-con suit in liberal cloth, it only serves to drive home the point that they are empty suits.<br /><br />The Middle East is best served by leaving it alone. It may be a potential lethal threat to us, but so is global warming, China and Russia. The more America steps into the dysfunction, the more we take the blame. Our planet is melting and our nation is still full of poverty and the uninsured..... and yet we spend trillions in Mesopotamia.<br /><br />If Hillary canât stand up and say, âWithdraw the troops and bring them home by January 1, 2007â then there is little reason to ever vote for a Democrat again.
