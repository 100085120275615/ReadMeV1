<br />A driver is stuck in a traffic jam on the highway. Nothing is moving.  Suddenly a man knocks on the window. The driver rolls down his window and asks, "What happened?"<br />
<br />"Terrorists have kidnapped Hillary Clinton, Ted Kennedy, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton.  They are asking for a $10 million ransom. Otherwise, they are going to douse them with gasoline and set them on fire.  We are going from car to car, taking up a collection."<br />
<br />The driver asks, "How much is everyone giving?"<br />
<br />"About a gallon."</div>
