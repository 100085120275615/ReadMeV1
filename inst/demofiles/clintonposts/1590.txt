<p>Jennifer:</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t agree more.  Hillary is too divisive and lord knows we need to put our fractured political machine back to work.</p>
<p>For the Dems: I&#8217;m very impressed with Joe Biden.  He has all the qualities I look for in a President.  Don&#8217;t know why he&#8217;s not getting talked up more.  He&#8217;s great!</p>
<p>For the Reps: I never thought I&#8217;d say this, but seems like getting out of the beltway has been good for Newt.  I hated his attacks on Clinton, but lately he sounds more thoughtful, and has put forth some really interesting ideas re solving our multitude of problems.</p>
<p>I hope both parties can find a nominee who has education, native intelligence, and will begin to heal our political wounds and restore common sense and constitutionality to the executive branch.</p>
<p>Hang in there, kansas dem, I love to hear from you, and as another somewhat disabled senior with a pot load of meds, I can relate&#8230;&#8230;</p>
