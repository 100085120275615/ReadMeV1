In the wake of the FDA's religion-not-science-based decision to stall women's access to pregnancy-preventing emergency contraception, Republicans are now deciding whether to force women who dare have The Sex to get not only pregnant, but cancer.  <br /><br />You see, there's a promising vaccine that would prevent cervical cancer.  But until they realized they couldn't get away with it, the Republican Family Research Council came out against such a vaccine, saying that not getting cancer would turn women into brazen whores.  <br /><br />Hillary Clinton has written a <a href="http://clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=249019&&">letter</a> to Republican Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt, warning him not to repeat the mistake of letting Republican Jesus do their science for them.  <br /><br />"We do not want to see another instance of ideology trumping the health and well-being of the American people," she wrote.<br /><br />Okay, so she doesn't say "Republican Jesus."  But she should.  It's a useful concept.
