<div> <p>In my never-ending, all consuming,&nbsp;no-holds-barred, someone's going to get hurt,&nbsp;impossibly arduous struggle to bring you the truth I offer this:</p> <div><a target="_blank" href="http://pittsburghthoughts.blogspirit.com/images/medium_Bush%20marriage%20in%20trouble.2.jpg"><img src="http://pittsburghthoughts.blogspirit.com/images/medium_Bush%20marriage%20in%20trouble.2.jpg" alt="medium_Bush marriage in trouble.2.jpg" /></a></div> <div></div> <div align="left"></div> <div align="left"></div> <div align="left"></div> <div align="left"></div> <p align="left">On Pages 20 and 21, the <i>Globe</i> announces "Bush and Laura's 29-year marriage FALLS APART," adding: "They barely talk to each other," "[t]hey argue when they do speak," and "she's afraid he'll hit the bottle." Quotes in the article attributed to "a longtime friend" include the assertion that "[w]hen the cameras aren't on, they have nothing to do with one another," and that "[f]or all practical purposes, they've broken up." The "family friend" continues: "After their last fight over booze, they just stopped talking -- period." The <i>Globe</i>'s report that Laura Bush is concerned that President Bush may "hit the bottle" is reminiscent of a September 21, 2005, <i>National Enquirer</i> <a href="http://www.blogspirit.com/rd?http://www.nationalenquirer.com/celebrity/63426"><font color="#FF0000">article</font></a> about "Bush's booze crisis," which reported: "Faced with the biggest crisis of his political life, President Bush has hit the bottle again."</p> <div align="left">Meanwhile, who's the mystery woman behind the scandal? Who is Bush's Monica? My sources report that a Mayflower Hotel staffer has confirmed that First Lady Laura Bush spent at least one night this past week at the hotel, which is four blocks north of the White House. Mrs. Bush reportedly moved out of the White House after a confrontation with President Bush over his ongoing affair with <strong>Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.</strong></div> <p align="left">From The Wayne Madison Report:</p> <p align="left">"Some Washington observers believe that the recent flare up between Laura Bush and the president stems from the fact that her poll numbers are twice as favorable as her husband's (60 percent to 29 percent). Laura Bush's recent solo missions to New Orleans, Colorado, and an AIDS conference at the United Nations represent a virtual declaration of independence from the most unpopular president in U.S. history. "She's [Laura's] taking a page right out of Hillary's book," said one Washington pundit. Rice, on the other hand, has been very close and loyal to Bush since she signed on as his chief foreign policy adviser in 2000. WMR has been told of intimate encounters between Mr. Bush and Rice on trips to New York City (multiple occasions) and New Orleans following Katrina."</p> <p align="left">All eyes will be on Laura Monday night (if she attends) when George holds a VIP ceremony at the White House to back a bill enshrining a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage. The name of the legislation? <strong>The Sanctity of Marriage Act.</strong> There's been no word form Monica ... I mean Condi on the issue so far.</p> <p align="left"><strong>***********************</strong></p> <p align="left">This made me chuckle:</p> <div><strong><a target="_blank" href="http://pittsburghthoughts.blogspirit.com/images/medium_ChainGang-modelled_300.jpg"><img src="http://pittsburghthoughts.blogspirit.com/images/medium_ChainGang-modelled_300.jpg" alt="medium_ChainGang-modelled_300.jpg" /></a></strong></div> </div>
