<div>Quinnipiac has been doing some new polling on who the Dumbacrats have to offer in 2008 as a candidate for President. "Big Ketchup" Kerry, John "LEFTwards", Al Bore, and Hillary were among the highest rated. What do they have in common besides awful nicknames? They're all losers. The first three all blew it and Hillary loses before she even runs!<br />
<br />The Republicans, however, have a multitude of candidates to choose from - not to mention the universal appeal of both McCain and Rudy.<br />
<br />The DNC is going to have to find someone able. She's all they got and that ain't much.</div>
