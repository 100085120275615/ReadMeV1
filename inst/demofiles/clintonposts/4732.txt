<p>Sebastian Mallaby lists Wal-Mart&#8217;s crimes in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082700553.html">WaPo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Senator John] Kerry&#8217;s former economic adviser, Jason Furman of New York University, concluded in a paper last year that <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/atf/cf/{E9245FE4-9A2B-43C7-A521-5D6FF2E06E03}/WALMART_PROGRESSIVE.PDF#search=%22furman%20wal-mart%20%22">Wal-Mart&#8217;s health benefits are about as generous</a> as those of comparable employers&#8230;..According to a <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/W11809">paper for the National Bureau of Economic Research</a> by Jerry Hausman and Ephraim Leibtag, neither of whom received funding from Wal-Mart, big-box stores led by Wal-Mart reduce families&#8217; food bills by one-fourth. Because Wal-Mart&#8217;s price-cutting also has a big impact on the non-food stuff it peddles, it saves U.S. consumers upward of $200 billion a year, making it a larger booster of family welfare than the federal government&#8217;s $33 billion food-stamp program.</p></blockquote>
<p>What an outrage!  Private business muscling in on the government&#8217;s sweet largesse, by offering good benefits to its employees and providing low prices to consumers.  What could the explanation be for such a crime, so heinous that brave Democrat presidential hopefuls must shout it from the rafters?</p>
<blockquote><p>The truth is that none of these Democrats can resist dumb economic populism. Even though we are not in a recession, and even though the presidential primaries are more than a year away, the DLC crowd is pandering shamelessly to the left of the party &#8212; perhaps in the knowledge that the grocery workers union, which launched the anti-Wal-Mart campaign, is strong in the key state of Iowa.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.dinocrat.com/archives/2006/02/09/hillary-and-wal-mart/">Six months ago we wrote</a> about Hillary Clinton&#8217;s being a director of Wal-Mart while her husband was governor of Arkansas.  We ventured to watch the Biography tape on Sam Walton, said to have been initially made in 1987, in which Hillary Clinton was full of praise for the man and his creation.  However, all the tapes of the program that we have been able to get were apparently updated in the mid-nineties.  Hillary still had nice things to say, but those clips were from her First Lady days, and not particularly interesting.
