<span>NEWYORK POST<br />'CLINTON VS. CLINTON' INC.<br /><br />Reading some articles regarding the Dubai Port World ownership deal of key United States' ports like New York and Miami is making us very anxious to know the latest and the up-dates. It has been a dilemma that went through several legislature and administrative sides. Opponents from different political and non-political parties within the administration or beyond are [stuffing] their fierce attack on the deal. Senator Hillary Clinton is one of them.<br />           <br />            The various articles that I have read from local magazines and news papers are dealing with the case form different angle. The various articles seem to be talking about the couple-Bill and Hillary, and as if they would like to raise the issue of opposite views and spread gossips. The local papers and magazines are way talking in beyond that to political and economic perspective.<br /><br />            The couple-Bill and Hillary Clinton, although working and supporting together and in the same direction, they are still human beings; with different views. That's normal. The up normal thing is the extreme directions; one completely agree and lobbying for, and the other completely disagree and welling to convince the congress to place tanks and troops to the ports owned by P & O in order not to let the deal move on. Ex-president Bill Clinton and the current president, Bush, are both agreeing and showing full support to make let the deal move in the right direction; since both of them are aware of the issue form all-angles, and have the [bigger picture] if we could say.<br /><br />If it's about the security, that Sen. Clinton claims, then the DP World will not reject that, since they are sure nothing wrong have been encountered with their strategies pursued.<br /><br />Maybe she needs to know more about other Arabs and Arabic government who are owning and controlling some of the key businesses in the United States and different parts of the world, with no security issues involved with that. Or maybe, out of sarcasm that I have heard from some business leaders, that Bill Clinton did not share with her the money back from the speeches held in Dubai.<br /><br /><br /><br />Humaid AL-Shamsi<br />ID 2987<br />AUS- MGT- 406<br /> </span>
