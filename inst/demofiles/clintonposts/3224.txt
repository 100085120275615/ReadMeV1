<div>I was sitting here avoiding reading blogs by entertaining myself with online poker and listening country music when a thought came to mind (yep, it happens occasionally):  if you asked Ted Kennedy, Howard Dean, Chuck Schumer, Dianne Feinstein, or Hillary Clinton to name one song by Alan Jackson, Toby Keith, Rascal Flatts, Faith Hill or Tim McGraw, do you think they could do it without a) asking an aide first, or b) getting the question in a pre-packaged interview with time to prepare?<br />
<br />Could something as easy to understand, not too as mention easy on the ears, as country music explain why Democrats can't win a single state in "flyover country"? <br />
<br />I once read a comment from certified redneck comedian and veteran of the <span>Blue Collar Comedy Tour</span>, Larry the Cable Guy that said something to the effect of "I believe in country music, the Dukes of Hazzard, and that country fried steak with white gravy is better than a cheerleader on game day."  Do you think any of the prominent Democrats in Congress today could understand that statement, much less relate to it?</div>
