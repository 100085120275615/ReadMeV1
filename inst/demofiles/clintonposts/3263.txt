<div>If Markos Moulitsas bet on horses, he'd be broke. If he were your stockbroker, you'd fire him. If he were a tv show, he'd be <a href="http://baconboy.blogspot.com/2006/01/demise-of-book-of-daniel.html">the Book of Daniel.</a> If he were a baseball team, he'd be the Chicago Cubs.  And if he were a military officer his soldiers would have fragged him by now.  In short, he has the reverse Midas touch when it comes to all things political.<br />
<br />I appreciate his enthusiasm and his aggressive polemicism; he is very entertaining.  But as far as effectiveness, I would like to know just what his winning percentage is.  And there is an irony to this, because just a few weeks ago, the Washington Monthly wrote this <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0601.wallace-wells.html">article about Kos</a> where Kos says: "They want to make me into the latest Jesse Jackson, but I'm not ideological at all, Moulitsas told me, I'm just all about winning."<br />
<br />Fair enough, and let's ignore the fact that being "all about winning" is an ideological position in itself, but it really does beg the question, just when is he going to demonstrate a propensity for victory?  In fact, one might argue that his ability to pick losing causes makes him more like Jesse Jackson than he'd care to admit.<br />
<br />Take the reaction to the cloture debate today.  Only 25 Democrats voted against the motion to close debate, which was a far cry from what Kos and company hoped to get, though <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/1/26/183015/942">he knew</a> that the numbers were against them.  Nevertheless, Kos still finds time to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/1/30/175352/650">blame others</a> for yet another failure.  It is the fault of other organizations for not taking the lead, of the millions of dollars in support of Alito, and the failure of the Senate Democrats to behave like Democrats, that caused the failure to filibuster Alito.  So what is the solution?<br />
<br />Demonstrating a remarkable penchant for stating the obvious, "We need more Dems, and we need more good Dems," says Kos.  The problem, of course, is that Kos generally wants Senators who are far enough to the left that they'll vote reliably Democrat (by his definition), but are too far to the left to be elected.<br />
<br />But the failure of the Democrats to filibuster Alito shows the great failure of Kos' strategy.  I think that Senate Democrats knew after the Alito hearings that they could not pull off a filibuster, but Kos and his crew made enough noise that Senators were essentially forced into making an appearance at an attempt.  Those who harbored any presidential ambitions were forced to vote for a losing proposition and in a very public manner that can be exploited by future Republican opponents.  This strategy may have helped Kos, as it forced key Democrats to capitulate to his desires, allowing him to see who were the "good Dems" and who were the bad Dems.  But it didn't help his strategy of getting more Democrats elected in the future.  All politicians have to pay attention to their base, but forcing them to do so in a public way and in a certain losing cause does them no favors.  My guess at what happened is that the Dems, knowing they couldn't get a filibuster to work, made a simple calculation -- those who needed cover from the Kos faction voted against cloture, while those who are in more "red" states or who realized that Alito actually deserved an up or down vote voted to close debate. It was these Dems who provided cover for the Senators who voted to filibuster -- they were doing people like Kerry, Obama, and Clinton a favor by allowing them to pander to the Kos followers even as they knew they'd never get to 41 votes.  But it also gives Republicans ammunition they can use in future elections and so this will likely end up being both a short-term and long-term defeat for Kos.<br />
<br />And by seeking to eleminate people like Joe Lieberman or elect far left candidates, Kos is again helping the Republicans.  Let's say he finds another Democrat to run against Lieberman.  That candidate will either, a) force Lieberman to spend money he would be better served to spend against a Republican challenger or b) beat Lieberman by playing to the far left, which will make the Republican candidate appear more centrist. In either case this helps Republicans.  Except in a few very blue states, the further to the left the Democratic candidate is, the easier it is for a Republican to move to the center while still appealing to his or her conservative base.  The simple fact of American politics is that if Kos wants to get a Senate majority he is going to have to support Democratic candidates who are (relative to him) more conservative.  But if he starts to do that, he'll lose the people who support his website.<br />
<br />There is another flaw in Kos' "strategy" and that is that his bold fighting words often raise expectations.  Sometimes he tries to soften things, like by acknowledging that it would be very difficult to get to 41 votes, but the nature of his hopeful polemics means that his constituency becomes deeply disillusioned with the Dems when they lose yet again.  One only has to read the comments to see that many of the commenters are ready to cut off the money or register as independents, indicating that the false hopes raised by Kos are doing more harm than good.  If Bismarck was right that "politics is the art of the possible" then Kos, by leading impossible charges, is showing himself to be terrible at the art of politics.  And that only helps the Republicans.</div>
