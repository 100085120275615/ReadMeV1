<p>McCain Vs Hillary?  I&#8217;ll take a John McCain over Hillary anytime. </p>
<p>Now, aren&#8217;t you folks telling Hillary to suck up to the radical left if she wants to be president?  LAUGH.</p>
<p>Your problem with Hillary in 08 are little things.  Things like family members selling presidential pardons to criminals, stealing the Whitehouse furniture on the way out the door, lying about Travel Gate, lying about what she knew about Monica, taking 100K bribe from that dirty broker (You know, her miracle turning of 1,000 dollars into 100,000K by &#8216;reading the journal&#8217;, trying to socialize 1/7th of the nations economy and being rejected by her own party, selling off the lincoln Bedroom to raise campaign finances, crooked staff going to jail (covering for her), the FBI enemies files fiasco, etc etc.</p>
<p>Democrats of course don&#8217;t talk about these things, they merely smear McCain and possibly mention that Hillary has &#8220;baggage&#8221;.  Yeah, I&#8217;ll say she has baggage and we are going to hear about it again and again and again right through the election.</p>
<p>There has got to be someone more honest, less dishonest and corrupt that you can run besides Hillary.  McCain is going to crush her&#8230;.and you folks will once again be claiming the election was &#8220;stolen&#8221;.   </p>
