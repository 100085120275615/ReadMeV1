<p>The Dems have actually stepped their class warfare campaign by taking on Wal-Mart. When WaPo&#8217;s resident pinhead Sebastion Mallaby notices it you know it&#8217;s painfully obvious.</p>

<blockquote><p>Once upon a time, smart Democrats defended globalization, open trade and the companies that thrive within this system. They were wary of tethering themselves to an anti-trade labor movement that represents a dwindling fraction of the electorate. They understood the danger in bashing corporations: Voters don&#8217;t hate corporations, because many of them work for one.</p>
<p>Then dot-bombs and Enron punctured corporate America&#8217;s prestige, and Democrats bolted. Rather than hammer legitimately on real instances of corporate malfeasance &#8212; accounting scandals, out-of-control executive compensation and the like &#8212; Democrats swallowed the whole anti-corporate playbook.</p>
<p>To see the difference between then and now, just look at the Clintons. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hillary Clinton sat on Wal-Mart&#8217;s board; and when Sam Walton died in 1992, Bill Clinton lauded him as &#8220;a wonderful family man and one of the greatest citizens in the history of the state of Arkansas.'&#8217; Campaigning in the New Hampshire primary that year, Bill Clinton came proudly to the rescue of a local company called American Brush Co. by helping it become a Wal-Mart supplier.</p>
<p>Times change. Last year Hillary Clinton returned a campaign contribution from Wal-Mart, even though she had no compunction in banking a check from Jerry Springer. The nation&#8217;s most successful retailer, which has seized the opportunities created by globalization to boost the buying power of ordinary Americans, is now seen as too toxic to touch. But a trash-talking TV host is acceptable.</p>
<p>Clinton is not alone in this. The stiff-necked Joe Lieberman, who holds fast to his principles on the Iraq war, recently abandoned his centrist economic credentials by appearing at an anti-Wal-Mart rally. No matter that Lieberman once served as chairman of the business-friendly Democratic Leadership Council. Now he proclaims his determination &#8220;to wake up Wal-Mart and say, &#8216;Treat your workers fairly.&#8217; &#8221;</p>
<p>After Lieberman, a senator from Connecticut, stepped down as chairman of the DLC, he was succeeded by Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. Well, Bayh recently showed up at an anti-Wal-Mart rally, too, as has Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who is the current DLC chairman. The Wake Up Wal-Mart campaign bus, which is trundling across the country on a 35-day tour, ensnares prominent Democrats in almost every state it passes through. Harry Reid, the Democrats&#8217; Senate leader, appeared at an anti-Wal-Mart event on Saturday, and Sen. Joe Biden and Gov. Bill Richardson popped up at earlier stops. When the campaign bus reaches Washington state on Labor Day, both Washington&#8217;s Democratic senators are expected to greet it.</p>
<p>How can supposedly centrist Democrats defend this betrayal of their principles? Some claim that their beliefs are consistent, but that the company has changed: The Wal-Mart of the early 1990s mainly bought American, whereas today&#8217;s irresponsible monster buys cheap stuff from China. But this argument merely illustrates how far Democrats have come. Since when did the party&#8217;s centrists believe that trading with China is evil? It was the Clinton administration that brought China into the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>Other Democrats reaffirm their centrist credentials while calling upon Wal-Mart to pay workers more. &#8220;We are not here today because we are anti-business,&#8221; Bayh asserted in Iowa recently as he demonstrated against Wal-Mart &#8212; a contention that the retailer&#8217;s shareholders, who have spent millions defending their brand against Wake-Up Wal-Mart, may have a hard time swallowing. But the idea that Wal-Mart pays below-market wages is false. Otherwise nobody would work there.</p></blockquote>
<p>The attacks on Wal-Mart coming from the Dems is nothing more than pandering to the far-left moonbat brigades and does nothing but hurt people who rely on lower prices and those who work for the giant retailer. It&#8217;s a campaign that is destined to fail. According to Wikipedia, Wal-Mart has <a href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wal_Mart&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=answers&#038;ct=result&#038;sig=__y2mKJDKulqoBB8rpL1ih1IBnh2Q=">1.7 million workers</a> (largest private employer in the US), not an insignificant number. Toss in about a gazillion loyal customers and you&#8217;re talking a pretty sizable block of voters that the Dems can&#8217;t afford to alienate and you&#8217;ve got the recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s that other thing too &#8212; <em>But the idea that Wal-Mart pays below-market wages is false. Otherwise nobody would work there.</em> The Dems claims against Wal-Mart are false, so false that even Sebastion Mallaby caught it. </p>
<p>Even though Mallaby never uses the words &#8216;class warfare&#8217; he knows that&#8217;s exactly what it is. So will a lot of voters who used to think that Democrats were interested in helping the type of people who shop and work at Wal-Mart. It&#8217;s becoming clearer to more and more people that the only thing Democrat politicians are interested in helping is themselves. The party outgrew any notions of people being more important than the party long ago, if it ever really had them in the first place. </p>
