<em>Okay, so I'm the only one demanding it. Anyway. Just read a synopsis of Ed Klien's book on Hillary Clinton. I thought Republicans were against smoking crack?!! He needs to put the pipe down. I think I said all I wanted to say about those losers when I wrote this. You listening Ed? They got that wire fully cranked on ya buddy?!</em>

</strong>Ladies and gentlemen I have stumbled upon a disturbing secret. 90% of conservative blogs are actually being written by brain washed monkeys. The monotonous tone of the content, mixed with the weird primal behavior patterns, leave no room for doubt. They all have a strikingly similar, some might say..Robotic, method of discourse and rebuttal. They are all quoting misinformation and faulty facts from the same play book. In an age when Dogs have their own blog and Cat's are being given college degrees online from prestigious universities, it would only follow that the Republican party would use both the power of the internet, and the trainablity of the monkey to accomplish their goals of ruling the world. Here are some of the things that tipped me off:<br />*They get agitated when you try to get them off message for five seconds. It's like the computer chip in their brain sends a signal to a strategically implanted wire that then zaps them in the ass.<br />* The word "liberal" makes them foam at the mouth, bare teeth and squeal.<br />* When confronted with logic they all start ranting about Hillary Clinton. Even if the topic had nothing to do with Hillary Clinton. You mention the war in Iraq, and for some reason they throw up the Hillary Clinton shield. If you piss them off they will type Hillary Clinton five thousand times and then they will throw their poo at you.<br />* Martha Stewart frightens them more than nuclear war. You show them a picture of someone who has BOTH female genitalia AND money and they wring their hands and rattle the cages. They have been programmed to believe that Martha Stewart is the great hunter who is out to make their species extinct.<br />*Picking insects off of one another and eating them brings them great pleasure. The more bugs one monkey has the more excited his monkey friends become. If you get between them and this grooming ritual they will come to your blog and rant about Hillary Clinton.<br />*They travel in packs. The dominate monkey rules the pack and always resembles Sean Hannity. He is jowly, fat, and thinks he is gorgeous. The female monkeys fawn all over him. They will do whatever he bids just to capture his attention. Even if it means serving up themselves or their offspring for his dinner.<br />*I have it on good authority that there is a distinct odor that accompanies them. It is not at all pleasant. It smells a little like B.S. but more like decay.<br />*They live to please their Programmer. No matter how wrong, or misguided or dangerous the programmer might become, they have been trained not to question him. His code name is the puppet master. Please the puppet master, please the puppet master, please the puppet master.In addition to these little tip offs I think they must have been provided with special computers. These computers have words on them instead of letters. It was probably easier to teach them to make complete sentences this way. These words are:<br />Liberal<br />Hillary Clinton<br />Idiots<br />Tree huggers<br />Whiners<br />American<br />Patriot<br />God fearing<br />Values<br />Immoral<br />Martha Stewart<br />Coward<br />Elitist<br />Freedom<br />Getting it down<br />Hard Work<br />Military Might<br />Liars<br />Terrorist<br />Terror Alert<br />Family<br />Children<br />Fear<br />Moonbat<br />and many many more. Just add a few "a's, and's, the's &amp; are's" and you can pretty much bet that any monkey can start up a blog and spread misinformation. It's genius when you think about it. Now don't get me wrong...there are some actual human beings, good tax paying Americans writing for the conservative view as well. And God bless them and their opinions (however misguided). However, when you come across a blog that chants those same key words over and over, and displays the above mentioned behavior..then you know...just keep surfing, it's another monkey.</div>
