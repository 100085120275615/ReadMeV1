<div><p>One of the many canards the Left-Wing Media Elites have been trying to sell us is how America is ready to embrace Hillary Clinton as the next President of the United States.&nbsp; There have been a series of articles praising her conversion to moderation and how successful she has been in getting a state overpopulated with Democrats to vote for her.&nbsp; Yet despite all this fawning, a recent CNN Poll indicated that 47% of Americans would definitely vote against her.&nbsp; Obviously, there is a disconnect between what America thinks and what the New York Times and other Left-Wing rags have to say.&nbsp; ABC even went as far as to have some boring show about a female President starring the ever expanded Gina Davis, which was taken off the air as a consequence of the Idol juggernaut.</p>

<p>America is not that enthusiastic about having another Clinton Presidency.&nbsp; The first one was bad enough and at least Bill Clinton had some intellect, unlike that robot who parrots whatever the polls tell her to think.&nbsp; Of course, the Left will argue that these results indicate how America is not ready for a woman President and how threatened people are by a strong-willed woman like Hillary. Why is it that all feminist seem to think that people are threatened by strong-willed women?&nbsp; If that was the case, why did Margaret Thatcher reign supreme for 12 years in the U.K., a country that is more traditional than the United States.</p>

<p>What is objectionable about Hillary is that she is a fraud.&nbsp; She never worked an honest day in her life while practicing as a lawyer as indicated by the Whitewater scandal and her $100,000 gain in a $1,000 commodities deal.&nbsp; In the White House, she was at the center of much of the scandals and corruption, including stealing furniture and collecting illegal contributions for her future Senate campaign.&nbsp; Not to mention being one of the biggest enablers in American History to some of the sorriest behavior we have witnessed by a President.</p>

<p>In end, Hillary is distasteful to so many not because she is a women or due to her viewpoints whatever they might be.&nbsp; She is distasteful because her entire record is one that was achieved through her continued marriage to a man she apparently doesn't care about, except when his fame was enough to propel her into the United States Senate.&nbsp; I would suggest that Hillary is no feminist as she is more adept a practicing one of the world's oldest professions, except that she provides her services for power, rather than cash.</p>
