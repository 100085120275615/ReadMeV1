Letâs play Connect The Dots.<br /><br />Dot 1: Sen. Hillary Clinton, wife and co-president of ex-President Bill Clinton plans to run for president on the Democrat Party ticket sometime in the near future, some think as early as 2008, when current President George Bush will retire to Crawford, Texas and Cindy Sheehan will move her âBring The Troops Home Now!â show to, some think, Chappaqua, New York, the present residence of the Clintons.<br /><br />Dot 2: Hillary Clinton was visited recently by Ned Lamont, the Connecticut giant killer who, with a little help from his friends, recently bested Lieberman in a primary and has now become the nominee of his party for the U.S. Senate. Lamontâs friends include a pirate ship of bloggers -- among them Marcos Zuniga Moulitsas, captain of the good ship <a href="http://donpesci.blogspot.com/2006/03/what-do-kossacks-want_15.html">DailyKos </a>â who hate, bloody hate, anyone associated with the Democrat Leadership Council, a bunch of candy-ass wimps and wimpettes who just donât know what it means to be a Democrat.<br /><br />Dot 3: Bill Clinton, Hillaryâs husband, was formally associated with the DLC, as was Lieberman. DLCâers believe their party had been captured by fever swamp progressives, most of whom post at DailyKos and other progressive sound-off boards. Bill Clinton was the Moses who led his party out of the arid wastelands of progressivism to the Promised Land. Hillary is not formally associated, except by marriage, to the DLC.<br /><br />Dot 3: Ned Lamont (the progressiveâs new Mohammed) went to the mountain; the mountain (Hillary of Chappaqua) did not go to Mohammed.<br /><br />Dot 4: And there at Chappaqua, the two banged heads and discussed strategy. According to an AP <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CT_CLINTON_LAMONT_MEETING_CTOL-?SITE=CTNHR&SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">report</a>, Clinton and Lamont were joined at the meeting by Hillary aide Howard âWolfson, Lamont campaign manager Tom Swan, and Lamont's wife, Annie. Clinton and Lamont had never met before, Wolfson said.â<br /><br />Dot 5: Top Lamont aide Tom Swan, a loner from the Connecticut Citizens Action Group, said, âIt was clear that Sen. Clinton and her team want to be helpful to Ned's election in November.â And to this end, the Clinton Campaign promised to contribute money and Wolfson to the Lamont campaign.<br /><br />Connecting all the dots, we arrive at the following conclusion: Hillary is a Swamp Fox; Ned and Swan are Babes in Toyland; and Wolfson is a Hillary imbed â you know, a spy.
