<div align="justify">The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com">Washington Post</a> has an article entitled &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/12/AR2006071201680.html">Beyond the Poll Numbers, Voter Doubts About Clinton</a>,&#8221; which examines the interesting dynamics surrounding <a href="http://clinton.senate.gov/">Senator Hillary Clinton&#8217;s</a> bid for the 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination. A taste:</div>

<blockquote>Never has a politician stepped onto a presidential stage before an<br />audience of voters who already have so many strong and personal<br />opinions about her, or amid arguments that revolve around the<br />intangibles of personality and the ways people react to it.</p>
<p>Clinton&#8217;s assets are formidable: an unrivaled ability to generate<br />publicity and money, and approval ratings that are notably strong,<br />given her polarizing reputation and the controversies she has weathered over 15 years in the national eye. In recent public opinion polls, she handily leads potential Democratic rivals.</p>
<p>Beneath these positives, however, there is evidence of unease &#8212; about<br />her personal history, demeanor and motives &#8212; among the very Democratic and independent voters she would need to win the presidency.</p>
<p>A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll highlighted the paradox.<br />Fifty-four percent of those responding view her favorably, and a<br />significant majority give her high marks for leadership (68 percent),<br />strong family values (65 percent), and being open and friendly (58<br />percent). At the same time, only 37 percent of Democrats in the poll<br />say they would definitely vote for her for president.</p>
<p>A Gallup poll from last summer also highlighted a perception that she<br />is too divisive, with 53 percent of respondents saying they do not view<br />her as someone who would &#8220;unite the country and not divide it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Follow-up interviews with skeptical Democrats and independents who<br />participated in the Post-ABC News poll suggest that many view her as an inscrutable public figure who gets high marks for her ability and<br />intellect but who nonetheless gives them pause because they find it<br />difficult to relate to her on a personal level.</p></blockquote>

<div align="justify">This resembles the predicament former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Reno">United States Attorney General Janet Reno</a> confronted in the Florida gubernatorial race in 2002 (she eventually lost the Democratic primary to attorney <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_McBride">Bill McBride</a>). Voters either liked her or disliked her. There were only a few voters that had no opinion of her. Senator Clinton has the same problem. This should definitely be interesting to watch. </div>
