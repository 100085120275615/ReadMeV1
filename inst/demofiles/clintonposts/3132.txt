<div>Hillary has become so paranoid about <a href="http://www.observer.com/pageone_newsstory1.asp">one part</a> of the nation that she has decided to go so far as fly to Boston, instead of taking the 2 hour drive from Portland, Maine. Why? Because 14 miles of the 2 hour drive would be through New Hampshire. Now I know a short flight when I see one. I flew from Salt Lake City to Jackson Hole, Wyoming one time to go to Yellowstone, and that was on a little twin engine prop. It took maybe a couple hours. The kicker though was when I had to catch a redirecting flight in Atlanta...from Nashville. The trip normally takes me three hours driving to get to downtown. The flight took all of 45 minutes. It was the most pointless thing I've ever done. The plane didn't even really have a chance to get to the cruising altitude, nor did I even have the chance to finish my soda and peanuts, and I think I spent more time taxiing and waiting than I spent in the air.<br />
<br />But on top of her refusal to go into NH, is that she didn't go there during the 2004 Elections, her entire first 4 years on the Senate, or the last 4 years as first lady. Does that seem a bit odd? Even though she continues to try and <a href="http://www.willisms.com/archives/2005/06/hillary_clinton.html">appeal</a> to both sides of the political spectrum all over the nation, she still doesn't visit the states with the big primaries.</div>
