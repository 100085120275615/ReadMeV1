<p><strong>Dear homesick Kiwi</strong></p>
	<p>Welcome to this exciting episode of the HUHU, offering the normal steaming plate of controversy, intrigue, probing analysis and lip syncing, together with news from Kiwis in New York, in Nepal, in Gloucestershire and in tears.</p>
	<p><strong>NEW ZEALAND NEWS</strong></p>
	<p>Just when you thought it was all quiet in this neck of the woods, over a hundred New Zealand soldiers had to be <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3685158a11,00.html">deployed quickly</a> to East Timor, with several hundred more on the way, to help stem spiralling chaos after the army split and the country seemed on the brink of civil war. The Kiwi contingent is supporting a much larger Australian force, and has already been <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3686725a10,00.html">in the thick of it</a>.</p>
	<p>Mark Inglis&#8217;s quite incredible achievement of reaching the summit of Everest on two prosthetic legs has lost some of its gloss amid controversy. The expedition passed a sick British climber near the summit, who later died. Some, including Sir Edmund Hillary, have <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3678980a10,00.html">criticised the party</a> for not effecting a rescue. The team has defended themselves angrily, saying at that altitude there was no chance of doing anything to help - it&#8217;s hard enough to keep yourself alive. Sir Edmund hasn&#8217;t spoken out again, and Lady Hillary has agreed to Inglis&#8217;s request for a chat about it over a cup of tea.</p>
	<p>Yes, a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3672481a10,00.html">boring budget</a>, as everyone boringly predicted. No tax reductions, a ballooning surplus and no major new spending. Boringly, Labour&#8217;s dipped in polls and most NZers don&#8217;t believe the government&#8217;s claims that there&#8217;s no money available for tax relief, but it doesn&#8217;t really matter at this stage with no election in sight.</p>
	<p>A New York based New Zealander <a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&#038;ObjectID=10382799">sold</a> her software company to Microsoft for $400 million.</p>
	<p>Wellington Hurricanes player Chris Masoe <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3682997a10,00.html">left a bar in tears</a> after being hit by a handbag wielded by his captain, Tana Umaga. Admittedly, he had been drinking all night, and had earlier lost a Super 14 final (oops, just gave away the sports news).</p>
	<p><strong>NEW ZEALAND SPORT</strong></p>
	<p>As widely predicted the Canterbury Crusaders triumphed over the Wellington Hurricanes in the Super 14 final in Christchurch, 19-13. From a spectator&#8217;s perspective the match was essentially ruined by unbelievably thick fog which made the high ball invisible to players and players invisible to the crowd. Some claimed the scores must surely have been estimates, others were heard to remark it&#8217;s just as well smoking is banned in pubs or the game would have been completely invisible.</p>
	<p>In other sports news, a New Zealand woman scored her <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3685195a4560,00.html">third consecutive win</a> in a cheese rolling race in Gloucester, England. Aucklander Dione Carter, 26, won the women&#8217;s race after chasing a wheel-shaped double gloucester cheese down Cooper&#8217;s Hill, a steep 200m slope.<br />

ONLY IN NEW ZEALAND</strong></p>
	<p>Why do New Zealanders go online? For <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3676680a11,00.html">porn and sheep</a> (mercifully, not at the same time). Of course, this doesn&#8217;t include New Zealanders like you.</p>
	<p>A fight and six arrests resulted from a small incident with a mobility scooter in Paraparaumu. The elderly motor scooterer disappeared into the distance, oblivious of the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3672479a10,00.html">bedlam in his wake</a>&#8230;.</p>
	<p>Sure, we&#8217;re famous for rugby and cheese rolling, but Kiwis have been achieving successes in other fields too over the past fortnight. A group of young Kiwis are through the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3678797a4560,00.html">final round</a> of Gidol - a music video lip-syncing contest for their version of You Make Me Feel Like Dancing (<a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=8283101121111618694&#038;q=%22You+Make+Me+Feel+Like+Dancing%22">watch clip here</a>) and 55 athletes set <a href="http://www.northernadvocate.co.nz/storyprint.cfm?storyID=3685618">a new record</a> for extreme ironing, 30 metres underwater off the Northland coast.</p>
