<div>Take a look around,and what do you see? I look around these days and I see a lot of <br />discontent People. Some are unhappy with themselves, some unhappy with others, and some unhappy with themselves and others. So many people these days are quick to blame others yet are not willing to take any responsiblity for their own actions. The news and talk radio are filled with people who blame others. All the liberals blame Bush. All the republicans blame the liberals. Then the liberals call everyone who doesn't believe what they are doing is an absolute rightousness an obstructionist. Where does it end? <br />

<blockquote>The only thing necessary for evil to trimph is that good men do nothing.</blockquote> <strong>-Edward Burke</strong>
<br />
<br /> <br />For good men to do nothing. I wouldn't exactly call Clinton a good man, but he did absolutely nothing to prevent the terrorists attacks on our country. As a President, he failed to protect American soil. Sure, he rode a great economy wave for 8 years, but what good is that when the economy was nearly destroyed by his failures? President Bush did what any red blooded American would have done after this attrocity occured. He went looking for someone's ass to kick. And when we found out who was responsible, we started something that should have been started years and years earlier. (1992 to be exact) And he stood firm on his ground, even when <br />the wolves were out to get him. He stood firm on his ground throughout an election year, and triumphed over an unworthy opponent. He stood firmly to quell the likes of senators Clinton, Kennedy, Kerry, Daschle, and so forth who stand so firmly against america. He was THE good man, who elected to do something. Something of a great nature. He decided to take on the world in an effort to give rights to people, not regime's. To instill demacracy around the world, even where demacracy was something unknown. <br />
<br />Do I think that this War on Terror will end anytime soon. Well, no. As a matter of a fact, I am going to tell you something no one else wants to say. The War on Terror will <strong>NEVER</strong> end. Let me say it again. <blockquote>"The War on Terror will never end." </blockquote> <strong>-GP</strong> <br />
<br />As long as their are people in the world the likes of OBL and Saddam Hussein and Quadafi and so forth, there will always be trouble. But in that same respect as long as their are men throughout our history, such as George W Bush, General George Scott Patton, General Dwight D Eisenhower, and so forth then we will always prevail <br />in the end. <blockquote>"You cannot be disciplined in great things and indiscipline in small things. Brave undisciplined men have no chance against the discipline and valour of other men. Have you ever seen a few <br />policemen handle a crowd?â</blockquote> <strong>Patton said that in 1941.</strong> <br />
<br />Have you ever seen a few policemen handle a crowd? Ask yourself this. Have you ever seen a few good men defeat many more bad? We have an enemy with no face, no country, no nothing. A formidable adversary for anyone, anytime, anyplace. Yet, our leader is willing to stand up and fight this unseen foe. And what appreciation does he get? Slander and media biasment against him. One day, we won't have a George W Bush in the White house, but a John Kerry or a Hillary Clinton that you liberals yearn so fiercely. And at that point, that very point, is when the USA will fall. At its weakest link, a president who won't stand up and fight. A president who will give the order to stand down when the order should be given to Kill them all. Then and only then will all of these fools who stand against president <br />Bush see the light, and then it will be to late..... <br />
