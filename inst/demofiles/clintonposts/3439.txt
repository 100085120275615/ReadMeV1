<div>Now, I voted for Bush twice. The alternative was un-thinkable. As it will be if Hillary is the candidate. Go <a href="http://www.chuckbaldwinlive.com/c2006/cbarchive_20060825.html">here to read Baldwin's column</a>. As is my want, here's a snippet.<br />
<br />
<span>Just recently, our "conservative" President expressed his support for the over-the-counter sales of the so-called "Plan B" (and his Food and Drug Administration just approved it), which is much more than a contraceptive. As I have documented before in this column, Plan B actually terminates an early pregnancy by preventing the fertilized egg from attaching itself to the uterine wall, thereby killing a newly conceived baby.<br />
<br />Secondly, this "conservative" President recently signed into law the Federal Pension Protection Act that greatly benefits same-sex couples-a decision that is being highly lauded by feminist groups around the country.<br />
<br />If that isn't enough, last April the Bush administration entered into an agreement with then-Crown Prince Abdullah that allows Saudis to receive scholarships to study (can you believe it?) aviation in the United States!<br />

<br />Read the whole thing, it's not long. It is, however, mostly on the mark. Do I regret voting for Bush? Considering the alternatives, no. Do I wish he were a real conservative? Yes. Then again, you know the old saying about "wish in one hand, crap in the other.."</div>
