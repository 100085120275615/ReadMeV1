<br />There wasn't really a big international news story in the papers today.  I say that because fighting between the Israeli military and Hezbollah isn't exactly "news", nor is the fact that the United Nations Security Council is unable to agree on the language of a resolution to address the situation on the ground in Lebanon.<br />
<br />The big domestic news story in the papers today was that three-term incumbent Democratic Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut conceded defeat to challenger Ned Lamont in yesterday's primary election in a phone call around 11:00 Eastern time last night.  Unofficial results this morning showed Lamont won with about 52% of the vote.     <br />
<br />The Connecticut primary story is big because, despite the fact that Democratic Senators from Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada to Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York have pledged their support to Ned Lamont, Joe Lieberman has already announced his intent to run in the general election in November as an Independent.  "For the sake of our state, our country and my party, I cannot, I will not let this result stand," he said.<br />
<br />
<strong>SO IF YOU MISSED IT:</strong>
<br />Senator Joseph Lieberman, having lost the Democratic primary election after being accused of "talking and acting" like President Bush, is taking a page out of the Bush Administration book and will ignore the will of the voters by running as an Independent in November.</div>
