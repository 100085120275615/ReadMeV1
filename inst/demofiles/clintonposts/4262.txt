<p><img align="left" src="http://ilfpost.org/author_images/GloriaFeldtPic.jpg" /><strong>By Gloria Feldt</strong><em> Note: given the news about the FDAâs current proposal to allow plan B Emergency Contraception (EC) to be sold over the counterâBUT with requirements that women under age 18 must have a prescription and that pharmacists must keep all EC behind the counter thus making it more difficult for women of any age to access, I thought a brief reminder of what EC is and why it should be fully accessible to all who need it is in order.</em></p>
<p><font size="2">Want to reduce abortions by half? Want to know who    is keeping the means from American women?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The topic is emergency contraceptionâEC for short. You might have heard it called the morning after pill. Itâs birth controlâjust basic birth control pills in a formulation that can prevent pregnancy from occurring if used within 120 hours after intercourse.<a id="more-140"></a></font></p>
<p><a href="http://ec.princeton.edu/"><font size="2">Research</font></a><font size="2"> predicts that if it were readily accessible, well-advertised, and properly used, EC could prevent about half of all unintended pregnancies and abortions. Imagine!</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The World Health Organization says it is completely safe for over-the-counter use, and 39 countries already make it available that way for women of all ages. It is supported by the American Medical Association, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, and a wide array of public health professionals. </font><a href="http://www.drkoop.com/ency/93/007014.html"><font size="2">http://www.drkoop.com/ency/93/007014.html</font></a><font size="2">,    </font><a href="http://www.arhp.org/healthcareproviders/resources/ecresources/ecotcfda.cfm"><font size="2">http://www.arhp.org/healthcareproviders/resources/ecresources/ecotcfda.cfm</font></a></p>
<p><font size="2">And no, making EC widely available doesnât make women promiscuous. We actually have the brains to use it appropriately.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Nor do women use EC as a substitute for their regular methods of contraception. In fact, when they have EC in their medicine cabinets in advance of need, it seems to serve the same purpose as the proverbial string tied around your finger.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">So if EC really could prevent many unintended pregnancies and abortions, whatâs the debate? Why is there any debate? And why should we care?</font></p>
<p><font size="2">The fact is, Emergency Contraception is a vital component to comprehensive health care for womenâit is literally, a womanâs &#8220;plan B&#8221;âif the condom breaks, if a woman has been sexually assaulted, if she thinks her regular contraceptive didnât work for whatever reason&#8211;and that should be personal.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">But it has become a political fight in which the science and medicine are being trumped by the politics of an ideological battle. For a timeline of the long-running battle over EC, take a look at this: </font><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/news/update/2006/08/planb_timeline.html/ohttp://www.motherjones.com/news/update/2006/08/planb_timeline.html"><font size="2">Over-the-Counter Insurgency</font></a></p>
<p><font size="2">Those opposed to EC are the same people who oppose both abortion and family planning in other venues based on narrow ideological and religious views they want to force upon all of us regardless of what the evidence shows. In Fact, FDA officials have testified that they were forced to place the politics over the known scientific facts and their own best judgment. </font><a href="http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=38921"><font size="2">http://www.kaisernetwork.org/daily_reports/rep_index.cfm?DR_ID=38921</font></a></p>
<p><font size="2">An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine called it &#8220;A sad day for science at the FDA&#8221;, when FDA management bowed to political pressureâ¦and continued to ignore the recommendations of its own scientific committees.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">I think &#8220;sadâ is way too timid a word. It is an outrage.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Because, after all, mistakes happen. Condoms break. And not always during regular business hours. And women who have suffered the trauma of rape should not have to endure the second trauma of worrying that they might become pregnant.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">One courageous and ethical woman, Dr. Susan Wood, resigned from her FDA position as director of its Women&#8217;s Health Division in protest over its disregard of science regarding EC.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Like Susan Wood, I think women deserve health care based on science, not politics, and they shouldnât have to fight their government to get it.<br />
So do Senators Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Patty Murray (D-WA), who are rightly holding up the confirmation of Andrew von Eschenbach to the post of FDA commissioner. Their stance has caused the FDA to make its latest tepid proposal. I say, Senators, hold tight until the FDA decides to actually make the approval with its current restrictions removed and an affirmation that the scientific evidence will prevail.</font></p>
