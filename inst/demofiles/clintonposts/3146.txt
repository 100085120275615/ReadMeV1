<div>I am confused how about you? Another time change. Ten A.M. in one room. Eleven A. M. in another room. A day designed for "Brunch" since you do not know whether you are having a late breakfast or an early lunch. A friend left Los Angeles at Eleven P.M last night with a three hour lay over in Dallas. He is supposed to arrive at Raleigh/Durham at Seven A.M. Where is he now and what time is it there? I have "Net" Friends on the other side of the world. Did they change their time? The Southern Hemisphere is having their Fall. Do they "fall back" or "spring forward"? How can they "spring forward" when it is "fall"? Their days get shorter in the fall so how can they save any daylight by going forward?<br />
<br />Where do they put the daylight I have saved? Did I sleep through it or is it in a Bank somewhere? It would be nice to be able to write a check for it when needed. Like you are on the beach in the late afternoon and six Miss Universe Contestants are walking around in Bikini's. Wouldn't it be nice to write a check for another hour, adjust your glasses, and resume your study of sea creatures?<br />
<br />They say Time Travel is impossible, yet each of us went into the future last night. We will return in the fall when we "fall back". The world does not seemed to have made any progress since everything looks the same as when I went to bed last night. How about you? Will I remember the "future" when I "fall back"? At my age, I doubt it.<br />
<br />They say "daylight savings time" was designed for the farmers. How many of us actually know a farmer? Should there be a "City Time" and a "Rural Time"? Would we have to wear two labeled watches or have a watch with four hands? There is probably some "watch" lobbyist at work on this in Washington right now.<br />
<br />How about all the babies born at exactly Twelve last night? What does this do to their Astrology Chart? When they return to their past where do they go? Since they.....oh no....look out new moms you may suddenly gain a lot of weight.<br />
<br />Did I grow older or younger last night? Sure hope it was the latter. I need all the time I can get.<br />
<br />What if there was "Decade" savings time and today was April 3, 2015? I bet we would notice some changes then. For one thing, Ted Kennedy would weigh 393 pounds but would be "holding". Senator Robert Byrd would not only be the oldest Senator of all time but would also be the third oldest human on earth. Hillary would be the mayor of a "village". Bill Clinton would be the manager of the new nudist colony on Mars. The United Nations would be handling the Food for Oil program and there would be a national lottery to pick two lucky "regular" people to actually see the animals in Anwar. They of course would be traveling with the "elites".<br />
<br />But I digress and am getting confused.</div>
