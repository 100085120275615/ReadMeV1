<div>Another lib strikes again with a, no I did not read this book, poor review of Goldberg's new book.  Ya he says it suks.  But whats interesting and cool about Amazon is reading all of someone's reviews.  Lets take a look at what slain likes/dislikes.<br />
<br />
<strong>Hates;</strong> "The Truth About Hillary", "The Anti-Chomsky Reader" by Horowitz,  "Unfit For Command", "Ten Minutes From Normal" by Karen Hughes, and "Give me a Break" by John Stossel.<br />
<br />Judging by his reviews of what he hates, he has never read any of these books.  No a drop of substanial criticism.  A seminar left-wing book reviewer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Likes; </strong>"Roger and Me" by you know who (an American Hero he says),  Chomsky, the Kitty Kelley Bush family book and "Against All Enimies" by Clark.</div>
