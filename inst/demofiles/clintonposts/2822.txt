<div><p>Well, yes, they do. And that is the subject of a two-part series I'm writing for <em>The American Prospect Online</em> on the future of progressive foreign policy. Here is the beginning of <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=ViewWeb&amp;articleId=11913">Part I</a>:<span class="summary">&nbsp;</span></p><blockquote><p><span class="summary">âDon't doubt yourselves. We know who we are.â
Senator Barak Obama said those words to an audience of progressives in
a well-received speech at the Take Back America conference in June. If
only it were true. When it comes to foreign policy, we do not know who
we are, at least not yet.
</span></p>

<p><span class="summary">Today, significant fault lines
divide the left on a host of major foreign policy questions. If such
disagreements were simply a matter of differing policy prescriptions,
that would be one thing. But the divisions are of a more fundamental
nature -- a product of competing meta-narratives liberals hold to
understand Americaâs role in a post-9/11 world. </span></p>

<p><span class="summary">There have been sustained efforts
by Democrats of late to close ranks and present a unified front. Bill
Clinton has said that âwe ought to be whipped if we allow our
differences over what to do now over Iraq divide us.â Even despite
these differences, most progressives now agree that the Iraq adventure,
for all the promise it might have once had, has proven a disastrous
mistake. And over the past year, Democrats in Congress have done a much
better job of coordinating their opposition to the Bush
administrationâs innumerable national security missteps. </span></p>

<p><span class="summary">An artificial, contrived
consensus based on the lowest common denominator might suffice while in
the opposition. However, if Democrats win back Congress this year or
the presidency in 2008, a more clear vision will be necessary. Ideas
are imperative -- but while it is easy to argue that Democrats need
âbig ideas,â it is more difficult to figure out what those might
actually be. </span></p>

<p><span class="summary">In recent months, there have been
several noteworthy attempts to provide an intellectual and ideological
frame for progressive policy. Here, in the pages of the <em>Prospect</em>, Michael Tomasky as well as John Halpin and Ruy Teixeira have offered the most cohesive arguments to date, proposing the â<a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&amp;name=Common+Good">common good</a>â
as a foundation for a new progressive vision. Unfortunately, both these
efforts reserve their focus for domestic policy. Their foreign policy
suggestions are vague and, for the most part, avoid tackling the
challenging questions that have sowed division within liberal ranks. </span></p>
