<span>First the good...</span><span><br /><br /></span><span>Friday was the 25 anniversary of Ronald Reagan's inauguration to president. Via<a href="http://www.townhall.com"> Townhall.com</a>, I found a great website from the <a href="http://reagansheritage.org/">Heritage Foundation</a> that commemorates Mr. Reagan and his career, including many of his speeches, memorable quotes, and video commentary from one of his closest advisors and a Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow In Public Policy for the Heritage Foundation, </span><a href="http://www.heritage.org/About/Staff/EdwinMeese.cfm">Edwin Meese III</a><span>.<br /><br /></span>  <span> My favorite speech from Mr. Reagan so far is </span><span><span><a href="http://www.reagansheritage.org/reagan/html/reagan10_27_64.shtml">A                 Time for Choosing, Mr. Reagan's campaign address for the Goldwater Presidential         Campaign</a>. To me, by far this is probably one of the greatest speeches in history. He just lays out in plain English the state of our nation at that time and more importantly, it comes off as amazingly prophetic as the circumstances he describes then seem quite similar to today. I've read it at least five times already and I'm inspired each and every time.<br /><br />So are you a Ronald Reagan Fan or at least agree that his presidency was benefitial to our nation? If so, what is your favorite speech or quote from Mr. Reagan? If you disagreed with him, why?<br /><br /><br /><span>And now for the bad....</span><br /><a href="http://lashawnbarber.com/archives/2006/01/21/blogs4life/trackback/">Lashawn Barber</a> writes<br /></span></span><span><span></span></span><blockquote><span><span>"</span></span>Tomorrow marks the 33rd anniversary of <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=410&amp;invol=113">Roe v. Wade</a>. In what was hailed a ÃÂvictoryÃÂ for women, the Supreme Court wrote a new law, giving us the ÃÂright of privacyÃÂ to have our babies slaughtered in the womb without fear of prosecution for homicide for ourselves and the abortionists."</blockquote>As usual she is right on the money! It is truly very dark days in our country when we continually allow the mass murder of innocents for the purpose of convenience and selfishness disguised as freedom and choice. I pray that the tide is turning with the appointments of <a href="http://judicialnetwork.com/cgi-data/press_releases/files/42.shtml">John Roberts</a> to the Supreme Court and the soon to be confirmed <a href="http://www.sctnomination.com/blog/archives/candidates/alito">Samuel Alito</a>.<br /><br />It amazes me to no end that many continue to maintain the most backwards of ideas that abortion is actually benefitial to women, while reality says otherwise. If anyone out there knows of someone who is considering abortion or if you are someone who is considering abortion, or maybe you have already had one and need help dealing with your "choice", <a href="http://www.optionline.org/">www.optionline.org</a> is a place that may be able to help. There is a plethora of resources and it is completely confidential.<br /><br />Are there any pro-abortion (anti-life) people out there? How do you reconcile with yourself the guilt of agreeing with murdering the innocent?<br /><br /><br /><span>Now, on a lighter note:</span>  <a href="http://www.fromthepen.com/hillary_plantation_speech.html">Hillary Clinton Plantation Speech  </a>Hilarious!<br /><span>(Hat tip: Bucktown Dusty of <a href="http://www.fromthepen.com/index.html">From The Pen.com)</a></span>
