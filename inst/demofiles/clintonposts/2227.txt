<span>She's full of it!!!!</span>
<br />
<span>Ignoring Illegal Criminal Invaders is done in sooo many places.</span>
<br />
<span>Come here to the Houston/Pasadena area and it's the same thing.</span>
<br />
<span>You have the same thing going on three or four families living in a one or two bedroom apartment.</span>
<br />
<span>Then the ones that don't work all sit outside and cat-call any young woman that happens to pass. Hell they don't care really what age you are. Seems lot's of them don't work but they all have money for beer!!!</span>
