<br />âWhen you look at the way the House of Representatives has been run, it has been run like a plantation and you know what I'm talking about..." - <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/17/nyregion/17speech.html">Hillary Clinton</a>
<br />
<br />She then said that Democrats were the main people responsible for the Civil Rights Movement. I'd like to clear that up for a moment.<br />
<br />"<em>
<strong>In the 26 major civil rights votes after 1933, a majority of Democrats opposed civil rights legislation in over 80 percent of the votes.</strong> By contrast, the Republican majority favored civil rights in over 96 percent of the votes.</em>
<br />
<em>...<strong>Most of the Dixiecrats did not become Republicans. They created the Dixiecrats and then, when the civil rights movement succeeded, they returned to the Democratic fold.</strong> It was not till much later, with a new, younger breed of Southerner and the thousands of Northerners moving into the South, that Republicans began to make gains.</em> " - <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/12/13/194350.shtml">Newsmax</a>
