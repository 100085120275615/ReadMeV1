<div>I see the "Culture War" differently than most folks do, apparently. In my opinion, it's not a breakdown between different races, or different sexual orientations, or different views about God; it's a far more comprehensive breakdown between rural/suburban areas and the big cities.
<br />
<br />Take a look at that Red/Blue map of this election, especially the county-by-county version, which is most instructive. The post-election focus of the media and the Democrats has been the âSolid Southâ that once again served as a remarkably unified base for the GOP.  This is overly-simplified and misses the larger point of the election results. 
<br />
<br />The South is solid for the Republicans, sure, but so are the Midwest, the Southwest, and the Rocky Mountain states. Not only that, but Bush won about 75% of the counties in "blue" states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and even New York. He also won most of the counties in California, Oregon and Washington State. So basically, the Democrats have lost pretty much every part of the country outside of a major metropolitan area on the East or West coasts, and in the Rust Belt. That's what it's boiling down to for the Ds. Not a pretty picture, especially when one considers that they will almost certainly put up yet another Northeastern liberal senator (Hillary) as their nominee in 2008.
<br />
<br />Now, Hillary will no doubt spend the next four years pretending to find God (I can just see her now, getting dunked in the river by an evangelical preacher with James Carville, Paul Begala and Big Bill standing on the banks), and getting to the political right of the Republicans on as many major issues as she can (she's already doing this on military spending and immigration), but pretty much everybody outside of the major coastal metro centers already recognizes the Clintons for the frauds they really are, which is why everyone they campaigned for in 2002 and this year lost.
<br />
<br />The Old, liberal media have in their zeal to demonize Republican voters as haters, focused on the Gay Marriage issue as the reason why this cultural divide exists.  Once again, this is an overly-simplified âanalysisâ and misses the larger point.  Sure, the Gay Marriage issue was voted down in 11 states, but I believe Janet Jackson's bare breast brought far more people to the polls than those ballot items did. Michael Moore and Whoopi Goldberg and all those leftist airhead movie stars who think their opinions should matter more than some poor slob working as a welder's helper in Crystal City, Texas cost Kerry far, far more votes than any racial or religious tensions did.
<br />
<br />The Democrats, rightly or wrongly (I think rightly), have come to be identified by these Red County voters as the party that supports the "Hollywood" culture. They have only themselves to blame for this. They will continue to lose election after election after election until they do something to change this, and frankly, I don't know what they can do.  They depend too much on the Hollywood community for money to just sever ties with them â itâs a real conundrum.
<br />
<br />I saw one of these mini-debates on Chris Matthews' Hardball show on MSNBC a couple of weeks back that I thought perfectly symbolized the real nature of the cultural divide in this country, though probably unintentionally. The topic was the "Desperate Housewives" promo that led into Monday Night Football recently, and the furor that has caused.
<br />
<br />Representing the political "right" in the segment was this 40-something year old, chubby but pretty housewife from Wisconsin who represents some "concerned parents" group whose name I didn't get. Representing the political "left" was a loud, obnoxious white guy from the Communications School at USC who kept calling the woman names, shouting her down every time she tried to make a point, and just couldn't understand why it is that parents of small children might have been a little upset that they thought they were tuning in to watch a football game, and got 60 seconds of nudity and sexual innuendo instead.
<br />
<br />The point here is not to judge who is correct and who is not on this particular issue (The little wifey and I watch Desperate Housewives every Sunday night) - the point is that there are a hell of a lot more of those 40-something, chubby but pretty housewives in this country than there are loud, obnoxious, sanctimonious communications professors, and all of their votes count exactly the same.
<br />
<br />That's the basic problem the Democrats have - they've become a party dominated by the communications professors of the world. That Party is run out of three places: New York City, Washington, DC, and Hollywood. That's the truth.
<br />
<br />The Republican Party is run by people from Midland, Texas, Butte, Montana, Casper, Wyoming, Cincinnati, Ohio and Memphis, Tennessee. That's why the Rs relate far better to the housewives than they do the communications professors, and it's why they will continue to win elections at the national level unless and until the Democrats fundamentally change the face of their party.
<br />
<br />Hillary Clinton is not the answer.
