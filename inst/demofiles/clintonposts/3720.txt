<div>Well David Rosen beat the rap. Yes this guy who was accused of raising many many of hundreds of millions of dollars for Ms.Hillary was aquitted of illegal campain funding. My problemwith this is...Well It happened in Los Angles Caleeefooorniiaaaa. This is a problem on both sides of the political spectrum. Why should canidates be allowed to raise funds for a senate or congressional seat in a place three thousand miles away from  their home state (wherever that is Hiltlery) ?? This party included Cher,Melissa Ethridge(lesbian), Toni Braxton (has declared bancruptcy yet gets to give $$ to Hillary) Diana Ross(nut case drug addict) and the Pitts or now ex pitts Brad and Jenn fake abortion loving Anniston. Well my point is a democrat or any name of almost any high profile case in Hollywood will never be convicted by a jury in that town.  Jackson ,Micheal is in Santa Barbra which is white and  rich old money . Heck you could have had video tape of this guy taking a huge briefcase of cash and he could have  confessed to the Pope in court he would still have been aquitted. Well heck come to think of it they had a video tape in Rodney(I am a loser King of morons case against cops there) and they were  still aquitted. ...  Heck in Los Angles you could admit to whacking Hoffa (tell them were the body is buried and still be aquitted). Heck you could have kidnapped the Lindbergh baby on NBC and be aquitted... My point though in general is why do we allow our politicans to raise funds outside their own states.Why does Hollywood have any say in a New York Senate race..???????????????????</div>
