<p>Hillary Rodham Clinton is at the horns of a dilemma, she is unable to make up her mind as to what is more embarrassing, the '<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2001/3/1/152836.shtml" target="_blank">Rodham</a>' part or the 'Clinton' part of her name and yet here she is aspiring to run and&nbsp;be the president of the great U.S of A come 2008.

Infidelity is a sin which any female in the 'RIGHT' mind would not be able to forgive, the retribution to which is only death and castration.

Last night she's on Barbara Walters, this morning she's on Katie Couric, and tomorrow she goes on Diane Sawyer.

Which explains why President Clinton has volunteered to play himself." - Conan O'Brien </blockquote><p></p><p><blockquote>"Hillary also said in the book it was a challenge to forgive Bill, but she figured if Nelson Mandela could forgive, she could give it a try. Isn't that amazing? I didn't know Clinton hit on Mandela's wife." - Jay Leno </blockquote><p>Note: Just stumbled upon another very like minded site dealing with the said topic. <a href="http://www.blogsagainsthillary.com/">http://www.blogsagainsthillary.com/</a></p>
