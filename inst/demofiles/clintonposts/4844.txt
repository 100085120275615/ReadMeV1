<p>Time magazine continues its public love affair with female politicians running the Democratic Party in its September 4 issue. Coming off a <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/rightangle/index.php?p=15812">huge cover story of Hillary Clinton</a>, the editorial staff has shifted its spotlight even farther to the left in an effort to illuminate Nancy Pelosi, the House minority leader (who, unlike Hillary, she proudly admits her political leanings: "I pride myself in being called a liberal.")</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1376213-1,00.html">As Time points out</a>, if Democrats take command of the House this fall Pelosi could become the first female Speaker of the House ever and second in line of presidential succession after Vice President Cheney -- a scary thought considering her reputation as a pit bull -- constantly barking (and biting) her Democratic colleagues into submission while stubbornly refusing to work with the GOP.</p>
	<p>Consider her quotes, just in the <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1376213-1,00.html">Time magazine article</a> alone:</p>
	<blockquote><p>"If people are ripping your face off, you have to rip their face off" and "Anybody who's ever dealt with me knows not to mess with me."</blockquote>
<br />
Not only does Pelosi come off a little harsh in public, when she speaks its evident she's not the party's most articulate voice:</p>
	<blockquote><p>Even her supporters acknowledge she's not the ideal spokeswoman for the Democrats in public. When she's not making clumsy remarks, like bragging earlier this year that one of the biggest benefits of a Democratic takeover of Congress would be "subpoena power," she's mind-numbingly repeating whatever talking points the party has agreed on that week or indulging her love of alliteration: "People, politics, policy" and "Money, message, mobilization." The charitable view of her often disjointed speaking style is that she's someone who thinks faster than she talks. The uncharitable view is that "she's Teresa Heinz without the accent," as one Democratic activist said.</blockquote>
<br />
The threat of Pelosi in power should raise concerns in both parties this fall -- while her desire to take bipartisanship to extremes could certainly cause major setbacks for Republicans (especially President Bush), her tendency to mouth-off without thinking combined with her bossiness behind the scenes could make for a colorful firework display among fellow Democrats in and out of Congress.
