<span>Weâre all familiar with the Democratic Party talking points.  Because each is repeated so frequently, however, it is difficult to know who said it first.  So for the bored <em>libdem</em> watchers, letâs see if we can identify the nutcases.

Cindy Sheehan<br /><br />While all of the above are Democratic Party themes, none of the answers is correct.  In fact, the perpetrator was one man, and I donât mean the head of the ACLU. <br /><br />No, all these statements were made by the Iranian nutcase President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in his â60 minutesâ interview by Mike Wallace.  If the interview were a boxing match, Mahmoud won in a TKO.<br /> <br /><strong>John McIntyre</strong> on <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com"><span>Real Clear Politics</span> </a>found Ahmadâs demeanor and appearance to be eerily similar to Adolf Hitler.  Appeasing Ahmad. and Iran has many similarities with the 1930's appeasement of Hitler.  In the early 1930's Hitler was written off as a sort of silly looking rabble rouser even when he assumed the Chancellorship in 1933.  Much of the world thought that Hitler could be controlled. They were wrong. <br />We see similarities today, with many politicians saying that Ahmad. is really just a pawn of the Iranian Mullahs.  âIn his answers to Wallace you can almost hear Hitler spouting out grievances of the Sudentland Germans and the Germans in Danzig when you hear Ahmadinejad take up for the Palestinians, Lebanese, and Iraqis.â He is making a play to speak for the world's one billion "aggrieved" Muslims.<br /><br />McIntyre worries that no one wants war with Iran or with a billion Muslims. He notes that the relentless advance of technology will make it utterly impossible to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons at some point in the future, and suggests that we need to change the Iranian regime and its current President.....before it is too late.<br /><br />Clearly McIntyre is right, and we should be doing all we can to encourage the millions of Iranian dissidents.  But I believe there is more we can do.  The US Air Force needs to strike the Iranian nuclear enrichment facilities hard and often.  That will put the damper on their bomb building ambitions.  And it might be the thing that makes the unhappy Iranians believe that the US is serious and would support an uprising.   Iâd take out their air force while weâre at it and as much of the Iranian tank corps as is convenient.<br /><br />Ahmadinejad, again:  âThose who refuse to accept an invitation to good -- will not have a good ending or fate."  Weâve tried long enough.  Now go to hell.<br /><br /></span><br /><br /></span>
