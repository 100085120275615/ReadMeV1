It is very specific on Hillary's votes on national security issues.<br /><br /><span><strong>UPDATE:</strong></span> I had to run after posting the commercial around 7:00P (again, real life doesn't wait for anything). Overall, it is similar in context to their last commercial which blasted U.S. Senator Hillary Clinton on her national security record. The campaign was criticized for not having specifics, all of which opened them up to attacks from the left and media.<br /><br />This time, they decided to go very specific and mention the actual votes Clinton made while a Senator that shows, in their opinion, a weakness on national security issues. In my opinion, this is a stronger commercial for that point alone: they give specifics. </div></div>
