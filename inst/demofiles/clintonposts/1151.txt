Russ Feingold knocked the centrist Democratic Leadership Council today, saying its strategy of hoping to win by being âa little different than Republicansâ hasnât worked. He also accused the group's adherents of instilling fear in Democrats who oppose the war. <br /><br />âThey are the ones that coalesced with the big corporations to pass unfair trade agreements that hurt America,â Feingold said. âIt was the DLC that came up with the health care plan with the Clintons that was so complicated nobody could understand it. Itâs the DLC that has cut off our ability to say things like, âLetâs get out of Iraq because itâs a bad idea.ââ </i><br /><br />He accused the DLC of encouraging a Republican-lite stance on issues that the Democratic party was once more disciplined about, such as education, health care and affordable housing.  He's also been noted in past statements to have said that an opposition party <b>opposes</b> and doesn't back down on issues important to the people.<br /><br />He also commented on yesterday's Connecticut Democratic primary:<br /><br /><i>In a statement released earlier today, Feingold called Lieberman "a fine man" and praised him for his help on campaign finance reform. But Feingold endorsed Lamont, saying, "Ned Lamontâs positions on the critical issues facing our country today are much closer to mine. We need more leaders like Ned Lamont in Washington." </i><br /><br />Feingold's camp also <a href="http://www.wbay.com/Global/story.asp?S=5260229">announced</a> they'll be writing Ned Lamont's campaign a $5,000 check, a standard amount for Russ' <a href="http://www.progressivepatriotsfund.com">Progressive Patriots' PAC</a>.<br /><br /><i>Feingold said Connecticut U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman's primary loss to anti-Iraq war candidate Ned Lamont is a warning that the Iraq war is an issue that won't go away and be replaced by other issues.</i> <br /><br />It was also noted in a <a href="http://www.madison.com/tct/mad/topstories/index.php?ntid=94136&ntpid=0">Capitol Times</a> article that Russ' message of principaled stances for Democrats in November is beginning to resonate:<br /><br /><i>Now that Lamont has defeated Lieberman, Feingold has an indication that his ideas are resonating with Democratic voters - and candidates.<br /><br />In fact, Lamont cites Feingold as an inspiration and says he would side with the senator on many matters, including a controversial move to censure President Bush for authorizing the controversial warrantless wiretapping program from which most Democratic senators have distanced themselves.</i><br /><br />The Iraq war has been a "disastrous mistake," he said, and warned politicians that "you are simply not listening if you don't know people have had it with this mistake and want it to end." <br /><br /><i>Feingold called for Democrats to be bold and said Democrats âshould not be afraid to say we will be tough militarily and otherwise when we need to be. But we need to say weâll be smarter about it and do a better job.â </i><br /><br />And lastly: His Presidential aspirations for 2008?  No surprise here:<br /><br /><i>[He] said he would wait until after the November elections to see if his positions are resonating with the public. <br /><br />Feingold said he would only run if he felt he could win both the nomination and the general election, adding that he wouldnât join the race just to make a statement. </i><br /><br />It's time for change and Russ is leading the charge.
