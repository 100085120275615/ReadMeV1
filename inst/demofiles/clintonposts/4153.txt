<p><a href="http://nationaljournal.com/todd.htm">Chuck Todd</a> makes a very persuasive argument that John Edwards is the most likely alternative should Sen. Hillary Clinton&#8217;s (D-NY) presidential campaign go off the tracks.</p>
<blockquote><p>Organizationally, Edwards is in the best shape of anyone in Iowa. His close ties to the hotel labor workers give him an interesting leg up in Nevada. South Carolina is a primary he&#8217;s already won once. About the only state where Edwards is weak is New Hampshire. And, frankly, if he wins Iowa and Nevada, New Hampshire support will gravitate to him. He&#8217;s planted plenty of support seeds in the state, but he&#8217;s just never been anyone&#8217;s 1st or 2nd choice.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s forget geography for a minute and look at who is best positioned on the two biggest issues Democrats will debate between now and 2008 &#8212; Iraq and electability. Edwards has become an unabashed opponent of the war and liberal activists in Iowa will remember that. That should play well in New Hampshire as well. He&#8217;s also heavily courting labor and someday labor is going to matter again in a Democratic primary; at least that&#8217;s what labor keeps telling itself. But the combination of labor and Iraq positions Edwards very neatly to Clinton&#8217;s left, where she&#8217;ll leave a vacuum since she&#8217;s trying so hard right now to make herself electable in a general.</p>
<p>As for electability, Edwards should be considered too liberal to win a general. Then again, there&#8217;s something about a southern accent which sends voters a moderate message. And that&#8217;s always served Edwards well. Democratic primary voters are very much like Republican primary voters; they don&#8217;t nominate the most electable, they nominate the most electable liberal (Republicans usually find the most electable conservative).</p></blockquote>
