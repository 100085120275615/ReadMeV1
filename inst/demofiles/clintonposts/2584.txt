<div><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Those&nbsp; logging on to this Blog will no doubt discover that something new has been added, thanks to the wizardry and thoughtfulness of Art [&quot;The Dovster&quot;]&nbsp; Galietti, my good friend and personal manager: the musical theme from <em>The West Wing</em>.&nbsp; Art and I share many passions: Torah study, Lavender Earl Grey Tea, box seats at Marlin's games, and <em>The West Wing</em>, to name but four.&nbsp; For The Dovster and me, <em>The West Wing<a href="http://kurtfstone.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/the_west_wing.jpg"><img title="The_west_wing" height="131" alt="The_west_wing" src="http://kurtfstone.typepad.com/kurt_f_stone_speaks_/images/the_west_wing.jpg" width="100" border="0" /></a>&nbsp; </em>has been an unmitigated joy these past seven seasons.&nbsp; Together, we have watched every one of its 151 episodes, marveled at the show's realism, and wondered why the White House isn't populated with such intelligent, articulate and sagacious folks as President Josiah Bartlet [Martin Sheen], Chief of Staff Leo McGary [the late John Spencer] or Communications Director Toby Ziegler [Richard Schiff].&nbsp; Over the past seven seasons, Wednesday night has meant sharing the better portion of an hour with the people we only wish could be leading this great nation.&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But alas, all good things must come to an end; after 7 years, and 151 episodes involving more than 1,575 actors and actresses, <em>The West Wing </em>has gone the way <em>of Mash, Lou Grant</em>, and <em>The Paper Chase</em>.&nbsp; And despite the fact that the Bartlet Administration no longer occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, it has nonetheless been honored with no less than four Emmy nominations: Best Actor [Martin Sheen], Best Actress [Allison Janney] Best Supporting Actor [Alan Alda] and Best Dramatic series.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What <em>made The West Wing </em>so special?&nbsp; Well, for one, it never pandered to its audience.&nbsp; The level of scripting, the flow of dialogue was, from first episode to last, intelligent, articulate and insightful.&nbsp; None of the characters was stereotypic; rather, each was drawn from whole cloth -- a living, breathing human being filled with abilities and foibles, energy and angst.&nbsp; And even if the geography was a bit skewed [lots of those folks actually work in the Old Executive Office Building, not the West Wing], the pace and energy were right on the mark. </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; During <em>The West Wing's</em> long run, members of the conservative punditocracy accused the show of having a decidedly liberal [read: Clintonian] bias.&nbsp; Truth to tell, <em>The West Wing </em>did portray a liberal Democratic administration.&nbsp; Nonetheless, it never stooped to making Republicans look like robotic Neanderthals, nor shied away from the real give-and-take of what used to be called bipartisanship.&nbsp; <em>The West Wing</em> gave America -- and indeed the world -- a glimpse of what people of high ideals, personal honor, moral integrity and human weakness can accomplish if only they realize that politics, in the words of Von Bismarck, is &quot;the art of the possible.&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;True, the people gracing the White House in <em>The West Wing</em>, might well have descended from Olympus or Sinai.&nbsp; Consider that President Bartlet was a Rhodes Scholar with a PhD in economics, his wife a still-practicing M.D. and his staff filled with high-minded idealists for whom tomorrow was vastly more important than today.&nbsp; Each Wednesday night we saw a president who, despite being extremely decisive, was both capable and anxious to listen to the opinions and guidance of others.&nbsp; Each episode involved the staff in crises both great and small, giving viewers a taste of all the ingredients that go into making up response and policy.&nbsp; The writers managed to navigate deftly between the Sylla of partisan victory and the Charybdis of public weal -- something that appears to woefully lacking in the real West Wing.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <em>The West Wing </em>first aired in 1999, toward the end of the Clinton/Gore years.&nbsp; I found myself wishing during that first season that disagreements between Congress and the White House could be handled as adroitly in real life as they were on television.&nbsp; Once the Bush/Cheney Administration took up occupancy in the real West Wing, I found myself wishing that we could once again have a president who was literate, articulate and engaged -- like Bartlet or Clinton.&nbsp; Over the past year or so, the American public is beginning to catch on to the fact that George W. Bush is, regrettably, a lightweight; a president whose gaffs are embarrassing, whose policies are panderous, and whose vision is limited to that which will be best for his cronies, the so-called &quot;haves and have-mores.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;With a few notable exceptions, American politics no longer attracts the best and brightest.&nbsp; Far too often, we are saddled with men and women who get elected because they can afford to run . . . or at least know people who can make it affordable for them to run.&nbsp; It now takes better than 4 years to win the presidency; four years of travel, speaking, fund-raising and trying to be all things to all people.&nbsp; I sometimes wonder if all the candidates currently criss-crossing the country gathering up chits and I.O.Us. ever give thought to what will happen the day after the election.&nbsp; Its a little reminiscent of the 1972 movie<em> The Candidate</em>, in which handsome, charismatic Bill McKay [played by<a href="http://kurtfstone.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/the_candidate.jpg"><img title="The_candidate" height="154" alt="The_candidate" src="http://kurtfstone.typepad.com/kurt_f_stone_speaks_/images/the_candidate.jpg" width="100" border="0" /></a>&nbsp; handsome, charismatic Robert Redford] spends 107 minutes running for the United States Senate.&nbsp; The movie goes through the making, nurturing and growth of the candidate in very realistic detail.&nbsp; Then, in the final two minutes of the film, McKay wins.&nbsp; His campaign handlers burst into his hotel room and inform him that he is now Senator-elect.&nbsp; In the movie's final, most telling take, Redford looks squarely into the camera, blinks and says, &quot;Oh God . . . what do I do now?&quot;&nbsp; I wonder how far from reality Redford's comment truly is.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I know that the Dovster and I are going to miss our Wednesday nights with the men and women <em>of The West Wing</em>.&nbsp; Fortunately, that's why G-d invented DVDs; we can relive the excitement over and over again.&nbsp; For all its intelligence, wit, charm and hopefulness, it will no doubt earn a spot in the Television Hall of Fame.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;True to its message, the last scene of the last episode ended on a note of hope.&nbsp; Abby Bartlet, the First Lady, is sitting with her husband in their bedroom at the White House.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;What are you thinking about?&quot; Mrs. Dr. Bartlet asks.&nbsp; President Bartlet smiles, looks at his wife and says,</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Tomorrow.&quot; </p>
