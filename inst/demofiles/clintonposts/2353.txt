<span>Each day I go through the news reports to choose something to post that I think is relevant and needs shared. This last week has left me so overwhelmed with all that's going on, I truly don't even know where to start. Wiretapping, Alito confirmation hearings, the Pentagon having a database of children for future recruitment, the Medicare Drug fiasco that has left so many without life sustaining medication, Al Gore's "finally a democrat with ovaries" speech and the White House spin machine going bonkers, John Conyers incredible request for investigation and impeachment. So I gave up, I can't choose from this list. It's coming too fast and furiously.<br />
<br />When I was going through the archives of <a href="http://www.happilystuckinithaca.com">Happily Stuck in Ithaca</a> for our podcast, I came across this list that Shane had posted a few years ago and will share it here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span>Things you have to believe to be a republican today:</span>
<br />
<span>Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.<br />
<br />Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.<br />
<br />The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing UN resolutions against Iraq.<br />
<br />A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.<br />
<br />Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.<br />
<br />The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.<br />
<br />If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.<br />
<br />A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.<br />
<br />Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.<br />
<br />HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.<br />
<br />Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.<br />
<br />A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense.<br />
<br />A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.<br />
<br />Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.<br />
<br />The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.<br />
<br />Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery.<br />
<br />You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.<br />
<br />What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.<br />
<br />Friends don't let friends vote republican.<br />
