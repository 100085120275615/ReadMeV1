<p>Today I caught up with a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/weekinreview/20lizza.html?ex=1313726400&#038;en=615fa8aacb81eee3&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">very peculiar Times Week in Review piece by Ryan Lizza</a> that perhaps was meant as a covert satire of some kind. How else to explain the thesis of "The YouTube Election" &#8212; that the rise of populist Web video  might harm the Republic, because more voters will get the chance to see their elected representatives in unguarded moments?</p>
<p>I'm not making this up. Lizza, and the consultant pundits he quotes, seems to think that the problem with George Allen's "macaca" incident wasn't that a sitting U.S. senator used a racist epithet on the public stump but rather that technology has empowered the public to witness such revealing incidents.</p>
<blockquote><p>If campaigns resemble reality television, where any moment of a candidate's life can be captured on film and posted on the Web, will the last shreds of authenticity be stripped from our public officials? Will candidates be pushed further into a scripted bubble? In short, will YouTube democratize politics, or destroy it?&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Letting voters see and hear what candidates say will strip them of their last shreds of authenticity! We must fight for their right to keep their off-color remarks under wraps!</i> Note that Lizza is suddenly talking about "any moment of a candidate's life" being exposed &#8212; but all the examples he cites from the campaigns of Allen and Joe Lieberman are of public statements in public forums.</p>
<blockquote><p>"Politicians can't experiment with messages," Mr. Dowd said. "They can't get voter response. Seventy or 80 years ago, a politician could go give a speech in Des Moines and road-test some ideas and then refine it and then test it again in Milwaukee."</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Horrors &#8212; now politicians will have a harder time saying different things to different constituencies! They might have to be (gasp) consistent!</i></p>
<p>Wait, this is the kicker:</p>
<blockquote><p>Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is not known for her spontaneity, agrees. "It is a continuation of a trend in which politicians have to assume they are on live TV all the time," Mr. Wolfson said. "You canât get away with making an offensive or dumb remark and assume it wonât get out."</p></blockquote>
<p>All right, it's time to pack up and emigrate. What good is American democracy if politicians <i>can't get away with making an offensive or dumb remark</i>? Isn't there some sort of Bill of Rights codicil granting them that right? If there isn't, can't President Bush add one via a signing statement?<br /><div id="simpletags">Tags: <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/george+allen" rel="tag">george allen</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/youtube" rel="tag"> youtube</a>, <a href="http://technorati.com/tag/new+york+times" rel="tag"> new york times</a></div>
