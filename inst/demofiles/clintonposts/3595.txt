<span>Poll shows hurdles for Romney -Conservative stances hurting him in Mass</span>
</a>". This comes a day after Newsmax made much of the fact that Governor Schwarzenegger was in Massachusetts and the two politicians did not meet: "<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/8/20/151438.shtml">
<span>Schwarzenegger Disses Romney</span>
</a>".<br />
<br />A wise move on both parties, I would argue. For Governor Schwarzenegger, being seen with Governor Romney would just add more fuel to the wildfires in California. No, I don't mean the ones in the forest, but the ones who can't see the forest for the trees. Two many Republicans in California want Arnold to "damn the torpedoes" and act as if he were in Texas and not California. Being seen with a pro-life moderate Republican who has Presedential ambitions would have these bangers of pots and pans screaming "See! See! Arnold's pro-choice and he's backing Romney, who's also pro-choice! Ah ha!".<br />
<br />For Governor Romney, being seen with Governor Scwarzenegger would just result in the same problem, but from teh other side of the spectrum. Many view Governor Scwarzenegger as some far-right extremeist, which is laughable, but there you have it. Judging from the quotes in the Boston Globe poll story (did they find *any* pro-life Republicans to talk to?), he'd do stand a better chance of winning re-election by meeting with Senator Kennedy.<br />
<br />But as to the the poll results...among 503 adults, here's some of the numbers:<br />
<br />60% opposed his veteo of an emergency contraception (abortion) pill<br />55% said he should not run for President<br />41% say he's accomplished little as Governor<br />30% say he should be given a second term<br />50% approve of his job as Governor<br />49% have a favorable view of him<br />
<br />Many of his numbers have slipped, supposedly due to his rightward policy slide. While this may preclude his re-election as Governor of Massachusetts, his shifting view on social issues make him (and Senator Clinton) more likely nominees for their parties, not less. Nobody expects a republican to win presidential eleciton in Massachusetts in the near-term, and it appears Governor Romney has set his sights higher that Beacon Hill.<br />
