<p>I would like to welcome all the visitors coming here from my buddy LaShawn&#8217;s website today.  Thanks for stopping by, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here!</p>

<p>If you are a political blogger with at least 1000 visitors a month I&#8217;d like you to join the Mind &amp; Media team because I have a number of political books coming our way.  Currently the book we are promoting is about Hillary Clinton and it&#8217;s called - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0974670189/sr=8-1/qid=1140559291/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-0658634-1783029?%5Fencoding=UTF8">I&#8217;ve Always Been a Yankees Fan: Hillary Clinton in Her Own Words by Dick Morris.</a>
I&#8217;m sure this is a book that every conservative will love and if you like the outspokenness of Dick Morris I&#8217;m sure this book will be a hit.</p>

<p><strong>Normally I charge a $25 joining fee for all new bloggers, however, for this one book, if you are a political blogger with enough traffic, I am waiving this fee.  Then if you like your experience with Mind &amp; Media you can join for all the new books for the $25 and get unlimited books.</strong></p>
