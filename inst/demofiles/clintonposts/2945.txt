<div>Below is my letter to Lis Wiehl of Fox News in response to her NYT-apologist drivel excusing the Times' (and seemingly, all journalists who betray secrets) betrayal of top secret government programs during war time.<br />
<br />I've become more and more alarmed lately with the leftward direction of Fox.  With its kowtowing to major leftists like Hillary Clinton, Susan Estrich, and their shameful obeisiance to their part-owners, the Saudis, in PC-ing all discussions about Mulim terrorism, Fox is slowly morphing into a bastion of elitism like all the others.  I know they are supposed to be 'fair and balanced', but does that mean they'll excuse treason?  Only for journalists it seems:<br />

<br />Subject: NYT is a Treasonous Entity<br />
<br />(In response to your article on Foxnews.com: <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,209281,00.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" id="bodyLinks">http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,209281,00.html</a>)<br />
<br />As are you Lis, if you make excuses for media betrayal of your neighbors (like me).  Today's media regularly and as a matter of course ignores the truth for its leftist, anti-Israel, anti-US agenda; it doesn't give a second thought to doctoring photos and using them as pro-terrorist supports, to ignoring the truth in favor of terrorist rendition of events. Today's media bends over backwards with moral ambiguity to allow killers of innocent women and children to obtain legitimacy.  Now that the terrorists are poised to obtain nuclear weapons, you and like-minded media types will contribute to terrorist victory right up to the first nuclear holocaust on US or Israeli soil.  Are you prepared to live with that Lis?<br />
<br />Our Muslim fanatic opponents hide behind women and children when fighting, targeting other women and children, so that any retaliation kills more innocents that can, with a complicit media, be blamed on the terrorist's opponents. Terrorists cut off the heads of innocent non-Muslims live on the web, they kidnap mothers so that their sons are forced to become suicide bombers, they gang-rape young women who have the temerity to walk out of their house without an escort, and they regularly use easily corrupted media types to promulgate their propaganda of hate and genocide.  Modern reporters enable this despicable behavior by allowing it to succeed with their attacks on EVERYTHING we, the GOOD GUYS, are doing to stop it.  This is why, with justifiable reasons, the entire western world distrusts and even despises the majority of media and their 'reporters'.<br />
<br />Articles such as yours that promote the NYT's bullshit excuses for their treason simply assist the media to continue their slander, lying, and betrayal of Americans and other freedom-loving people around the world.  IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IF OUR ENEMIES KNEW ABOUT THE WIRE-TAPPING AND FINANCIAL SNOOPING we are doing; telling them about it is treason. No question.  In a former age when journalists cared about right and wrong, a newspaper revealing top-secret government programs during a time of war to the benefit of US enemies would be shuttered and its editors and reporters imprisoned.<br />
<br />Personally, I long for the days when traitors were taken out to the nearest wall and unceremoniously shot. Lis you obviously are missing the entire point of the war on terror - it's to ELIMINATE terror and terrorists!  Those who would murder you, your children, your family, and everyone you know, combatant or not, to further their power-mad agendas.  When you excuse the behavior of terrorist fronts like the NYT, you only lump yourself in with those who are part of the problem.<br />
