<div>I once asked Tom Baker, alias CrankyLiberal, who was paying the bills for<br />CrankyLiberalpages.com.  The blog had undergone expensive and extensive<br />renovation.  In his personal statement on CL, Baker confirmed that he was being <br />paid.  The way he put it, was that it keeps his kids in toys and under a roof, a direct reference to being paid for running a virulently hard-left blog.<br />
<br />Baker obfuscated his answer by asking other CL contributors if they were<br />getting any money for their posts.  But he never categorically denied being<br />paid, and the reference in his bio sketch directly contradicted his <br />pathetic effort to obscure his answer.<br />
<br />Now Baker has moved on to a âcooperativeâ blog with his friends <br />at "Bring It On," perpetuating their Krishna-like mantra: âWe hate Bush.â  <br />They are being funded by a mysterious source of income.  BIO is in the <br />same vain as moveon.org, daily kos.com, and democratunderground.com. etc.<br />
<br />David Horowitz in his new book âThe Shadow Partyâ  described graphically <br />how billionaire hard-left socialist George Soros is using his billions in<br />co-opting the centerist Democrat Party and turning it into a hard left socialistic<br />cadre via leftist blogs, underground organizations and selected politicians like <br />Hillary Clinton, Harold Ickes and now Ned Lamont.<br />
<br />Which brings me to my question for Tom Baker, Dr.[not] Forebush or any other<br />âcontributorâ (read identified poster, which by the way include Paul Merda) to <br />Bring It On: Have any/all individually or collectively received, been promised, <br />accepted any funds, benefits in lieu of, equipment, vehicles, free use of building(s), services or free use of otherwise paid for informational contributions from any Soros organization, employee, advisor, or has any individual, groups of <br />individuals or relatives of BIO contributors received from Soros, his organizations, companies of any type, political committees, PACs, groups identified with or associated with Soros. If so, BIO is nothing more than a socialistic front for the Soros hard left machine.<br />
<br />Donât expect an answer.  Baker hid behind obfuscation the first time<br />I asked it, he will ignore it so he doesnât have to admit it or attack NewsGnome <br />to avoid answering (which is the preferred method of far left radicals ala Hillary <br />Clinton). <br />
<br />It is an insidious effort to undermine America and is no less destructive than <br />the methods incorporated by Osama bin Laden and radical Islam. Soros and his BIO type minions are trying to destroy America from within. Soros canât stand freedom. He is a socialist/communist at heart for everybody else but himself.  He undermines it at every opportunity so he can steal billions from you and I.</div>
