<div>Bill Clinton's one achievement as President was the sign into law 'bipartisan' welfare reform.  But like everything else in his Presidency it was mostly smoke and mirrors because he was merely co-opting the GOP agenda.<br />
<br />The legislation ended "entitlement" welfare, under which low-income parents with children could receive federal assistance with relative ease.  Now welfare recipients have a time limit for how long they can remain on the rolls, and they must show they are actively seeking work.<br />
<br />Talk about co-opting! The 42nd President actually vetoed this Republican legislation twice before political strategist convinced him of the electoral peril that awaited him (a re-election loss in '96 to Bob Dole) if he didn't sign it.<br />
<br />As for the claim that the welfare reform was 'bipartisan,' that's just more revisionist history.  In fact 98 House Democrats bitterly opposed the bill.  <br />
<br />From the WSJ:<br />
<br />"Former Georgia Congressman (now Senator) John Lewis not too subtly raised the specter of fascism as he literally screamed on the House floor, "They're coming for the children. They're coming for the poor. They're coming for the sick, the elderly and the disabled."<br />
<br />New Jersey Senator Frank Lautenberg predicted that "U.S. streets would "look like the streets of the cities in Brazil" where there are children "engaging in prostitution."<br />
<br />As usual Liberals were wrong.  Welfare reform is working.  The welfare rolls are down from five million in 1995 to two million today.  People are less dependent on the federal government and more responsible for their own behavior, their own circumstances.  It's called individual responsibility, a key Republican tenet.</div>
