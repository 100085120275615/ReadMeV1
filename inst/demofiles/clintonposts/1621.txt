<p><font size="3"><strong>America is safer under President George W Bush. </strong></font></p> <p><font size="3"><strong>This is the National defense policy that the democrats are offering to the American people. âLetâs offer the terrorist a cup of tea and some of those little butter cookies and maybe they will like usâ. This is the policy Harry Reid, Howard Dean, Nancy Pelosi, and the loony left of the democrat party want to use in fighting terrorist. They want to attack the President and the Republican Party, saying we are not safe, that the presidentâs policies are making us less safe. The President has the&nbsp;guts to take the terrorist on head to head; he will not back down from threats. The democrats have NO plan to keep America safe. Tea and cookies will not do it. Sitting down at a table and talking will not do it. Having guts to fight them will win. </strong></font></p> <p><font size="3"><strong>I hear their words but their actions speak louder. They will not fight the terrorist. If the democrat party takes control America will be less safe. Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi as a defender of the American people? The democrat party and their suggestions that they are the party to keep America safe, is a joke. We need a strong leader. Harry Reid, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Howard Dean are NOT strong leaders. Thus far the democrat party has failed to put forth a plan or vision for keeping America safe. Their first words are âto put in place everything the 9ll commission suggested". From everything I have read most of the suggestions are in place. If President Bush has made us less safe, then I have to ask what happened last week? Thousands of people are still alive today because the President along with our allies in the war on terror&nbsp;had the courage to go after the terrorist, not offering them Tea and cookies. The democrat leadership is congress is very weak, they have no backbone when it comes to fighting terrorist. </strong></font></p> <p><font size="3"><strong>Last week when the terrorist plot was uncovered, instead of the democrat party being delighted that thousands of lives where not blown to bits in mid air, they were upset because it showed their lack of backbone and their weakness when it comes to standing up to thugs. The democrat party with their leadership sought to attack the President and the Republican Party. It is to their shame that they are so weak. They cave in to the loony left of their party. The democrat leadership should have some balls and stand up to the terrorist and the liberals in their party. Protecting America and the American people are more important than any party. This is a lesson the democrat leadership needs&nbsp;to learn. </strong></font></p> <p><font size="3"><strong>Now you know&nbsp;my thoughts for this Tuesday, August 15, 2006</strong></font></p> <p><font size="3"><strong>Keith</strong></font></p> </div>
