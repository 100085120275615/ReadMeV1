Is Gore going to run again? (I sure hope so.) This movie release of "<a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">An Inconvenient Truth</a>" seems awfully well-timed for such a move.  Is it possible that Hillary won't be the one? As I've heard more than one fiercely loyal Democrat say (and I echo): I hope she doesn't get the nomination, but if she does I'll be 100% behind her.  I really like her and would be happy to have her as my President, but I think that she's so polarizing that she can't possibly win. Of course people said that her husband didn't have a chance either.<br /><br />I read the worst Maureen Dowd piece yesterday (<a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/tsc.html?URI=http://select.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/opinion/24dowd.html&OQ=_rQ3D1&amp;OP=24d76ab6Q2FQ7B%281yQ7Bfx,Q7CQ7CfQ7B844KQ7B49Q7B8vQ7BQ7CQ24UQ7DUQ7CQ7DQ7B8vQ60Q7C%28Q60@ife6">link</a>, just in case you subscribe to Times Select or <a href="http://www.smirkingchimp.com/viewtopic.php?topic=65497&forum=20">here</a> for a likely non-copyright version) - making fun of Hillary for making a wonky speech about the environment.  Give me a break!  Maybe I'm just weird in that I find energy conservation and global warming a fascinating topic, but Dowd's comments remind me of a junior high girl trying to fit in by playing dumb.<br /><br />Update: I happened to catch the Hillary Clinton speech referenced above on C-SPAN today, and it was one of the best overviews of the topic I've heard, accompanied by a plan of action that sounded very sensible (except for maybe the extra taxes on the oil industry). I'm even more disgusted with Dowd's piece now. Could the media please pay attention to the complex issues rather than reporting on the political strategy behind every move?
