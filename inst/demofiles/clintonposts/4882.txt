<p>What was in those <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/11/AR2006041101888.html">infamous trailers</a> found in the Iraqi desert?  No one knows for sure, but here are some definite possibilities.</p>
<li>They held Saddam&#8217;s &#8220;Hall of Pastels&#8221;, featuring plush lavender faux fur sofas, calming light blue cabinets, and a toilet with a pink tasseled seat cover.  Saddam invited friends to his hideaway twice a week for &#8220;man time.&#8221;</li>
<li>The trailers were blown in by tornado from the southern Iraqi region known as the &#8220;Red Turban Riviera.&#8221;</li>
<li>The trailers were relics of the Clinton administration.  He may have had a Hillary getaway bungalow in Iraq (people from Arkansas call trailers bungalows - it&#8217;s Ok, my wife is from Arkansas).  Clinton allegedly tricked his dates into thinking they were really going to the &#8220;mystic sands of the Sahara.&#8221;</li>
<li>The trailers were really old schoolbuses painted like trailers to throw off the US Military&#8217;s search for WMDs.</li>
<li>Before the fall of Baghdad, the trailers were the future home of Wal Mart.</li>
<li>They were part of one of Saddam&#8217;s eccentric hobbies.  He created the trailers as part of a large scale program to create lifesized Tonka Toy vehicles.</li>
<li>The trailers were the HQ for Saddam&#8217;s program to direct anti-war protests in the US in the event of a conflict.  The control center has since been relocated to Alec Baldwin&#8217;s backyard.</li>
<p>By the way, Happy Easter and/or Passover to those of you that partake in such things.  To the rest of you, enjoy your long weekend, you moochers.</p>
