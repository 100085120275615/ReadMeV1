<a href="http://www.urbanelephants.com/nyc/" target="_blank">Urban Elephants</a> is pointing out that <a href="http://blogs.timesunion.com/capitol/?p=1930" target="_blank">Capital Confidential </a>is reporting that KT McFarlandâs camp is planning on filing their petitions to get KT on the âJobs and Security Partyâ for the November election so she can run for Senate no matter what happens in the Primary.<br />
<br />As of right now I hope I didnât make a mistake in signing that petition.  If KT was to loose the primary I would hope that she would just bail out.  Hillary is expected to win come November anyway and having two Republicans on the ballot will make the probability of defeating Hillary at about the same odds of winning Mega Millions.<br />
<br />Where I would not regret signing the petition is if she won the primary and sat on an extra line on Election Day.  Though I donât think it would make a big difference, the title âJobs and Securityâ could get KT some extra votes.</div>
