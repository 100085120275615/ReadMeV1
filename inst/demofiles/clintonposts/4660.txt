<p>MSNBC's Chris Matthews, host of Hardball, did his best to rattle both of Virginia's Democratic Senate candidates during a rapid-fire mini debate Thursday evening. And rattle he did.</p>

<p>Former lobbyist Harris Miller stumbled his way through a typical set of withering questions about the Iraq war and why he didn't oppose it from the beginning.</p>

<blockquote>"Mr. Miller, when did you decide in your mind, in your heart, that we shouldn't have gone to Iraq?" Matthews asked.

<p>When Miller said he had not opposed it instictively and gave a long answer about having been misled by Colin Powell, Matthews pounced.</p>

<p>"I'm not clear then, did you think it was wrong to go to Iraq or you just didn't like it when we got there?" Matthews said.</p>

<p>Miller kept trying: "We were told there were weapons of mass destruction, which was a lie, and we were told there was a plan to get out of Iraq within three months. Both of those were lies, Chris."</p>

<p>"But you believed them?"</p>

<p>"Because I didn't have access to the intelligence."</p>

<p>"Did you have access to history books?"</p>

<p>"Yes I had history books."</p>

<p>"Mmmmmmm," Matthews said, in an unmistakable "gotcha" kind of way.</blockquote></p>

<p>But soon it was Jim Webb's turn.</p>

<blockquote>"Do you believe in punishing employers who hire people illegally," Matthews asked the former Reagan official.

<p>"That's a very complex question because of the whole range of employers that are involved. certainly large employers you could have sanctions."</p>

<p>Matthews repeatedly asked Webb what he meant by "complicated."</p>

<p>"Why would you let someone walk Scot free?"</p>

<p>"I don't think its a question of letting somebody walk Scot free. It's a question of accountability."</p>

<p>"Lemme tell you something," Matthews said, sensing weakness. "People have been turned down for attorney general. People have had big trouble in American politics for hiring people illegally and they can't give casual answers like,  'oh it's complicated.'"</blockquote></p>

<p>But perhaps the most stunning moment came at the end, when Matthews started grilling the two candidates about the upcoming presidential contest.</p>

<p>Final question. if you had to vote right now on a piece of paper in front of you, Hillary or Mark Warner, who would you vote for?"</p>

<p>Miller said, simply: "Mark Warner." </p>

<p>But Webb, perhaps forgetting that Warner is practically a rock star in the state Webb is hoping to get elected from, said: "I remain undecided."</p>

<p>So do the voters. Until Tuesday.</p>
