The redemonstration of majority has already begun to pay off in terms of support from politicians. Below, Nerds provide two letters that GSOC and Sexton have received from political supporters on both sides of the aisle.<br /><hr /><br />April 27, 2006<br /><br />As long-time supporters of both higher education and the right of workers to organize, we write to indicate our strong desire that New York University (NYU) engage in good faith negotiations with its graduate employees, GSOC/UAW Local 2110, for a collective bargaining agreement. <br /><br />NYU is a valued and important institution that does much to add to New York City's prestige, intellectual capital and vibrancy. Similarly, we believe that graduate employees are an essential part of the university community - they perform significant work for the University and deserve to have their work valued accordingly.<br /><br />We understand that a 2005 NLRB decision, holding that universities are not obligated under the National Labor Relations Act to bargain with the representatives of graduate employees, has stalled negotiations. However, we also understand that nothing in that decision or the law prevents an employer from maintaining a collective bargaining relationship with GSOC/UAW.<br /><br />Indeed, GSOC/UAW Local 2110 and NYU have successfully conducted negotiations in the past. It is our hope that the parties will once again enter into discussions that conclude with a mutually beneficial contract.<br /><br />Sincerely, <br /><br />Charles E. Schumer &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hillary Rodham Clinton<br />U.S. Senator (D-NY)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. Senator (D-NY)<br /><br /><hr /><br />April 26, 2006<br /><br />Dear Dr. Sexton, <br /><br />I want you to know that I have never written a letter of this nature before. I represent the 59th Senate District in Western New York, which includes the State University of New York at Geneseo. As the senior Senator from all of upstate New York, I have always been a strong supporter of higher education. However, your school has come under heavy scrutiny by many of us upstate. <br /><br />For your University, which is one of the most liberal in the country, to refuse to negotiate a second labor agreement with the UAW for graduate employees is hypocritical and, in the opinion of many, ludicrous. To hide behind an NLRB decision is, frankly, cowardice. <br /><br />For NYU, a University that spawned the Brennan Institute, possibly the most liberal institution in the State, to hide behind the cloak of legality, is frankly unconscionable. You should be ashamed to know that your institution seems to represent anti-government and anti-democracy principles. <br /><br />My advice is to lead your University in responsibly negotiating with the GSOC/UAW before you look even worse. <br /><br />Very truly yours, <br /><br />Dale Volker (R)
