Big time pigskin fan Dick Nixon himself allegedly phoned George H. Allen at on at least one occasion during a game with a suggested play. The play according to legend failed.<br /><br />His brother Bruce is the current GM of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and a colossal horses ass in his own right who once remarked as a justification for signing substance abusing, sex offender Darrell Russell that:<br /><br /><em><span>"Bill Clinton did a lot worse things than Darrell Russell, But he won Florida twice and was our president."<br /></span></em><br />His sister Jennifer recalled young Georgeâs mean streak during his youth when he allegedly hit her boyfriend with a pool que, threw his brother through a sliding glass door and dragged her up a flight of stairs by her hair. She wrote in her book <em>Fifth Quarter: The Scrimmage of a Football Coachâs Daughter</em> that:<br /><br /><em><span>âGeorge hoped someday to become a dentistâ¦..George said that he saw dentistry as a perfect professionâgetting paid to make people sufferâ<br /></span></em><br />When considering that George W. Bush used to get quite the thrill from jamming firecrackers up the asses of captured frogs and then watching them blow up it would seem like he would make a great replacement for the current son with a brand name and a taste for cruelty who currently resides in the White House.<br /><br />Meet George Felix Allen, former Virginia Governor, current United States Senator and the darling of many of the farthest of the far right-wingers to receive the nod for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination. He is a red meat eating, tough talking, God fearing, flag sucking, ass kicking all-American bastard. He is one of a large field of potential candidates including the opportunistic John McCain, flip-flopping Bill Frist, Mitt Romney, Rudy Giuliani who is far too liberal for the theocrats, Sam Brownback who is far too theocratic for everyone else, Condi Rice (a media favorite but Karl Rove knows damned well that those red states would all turn blue for obvious reasons) and the dreaded ultra-stealth candidate Jeb Bush.<br /><br />Allen has done well in flying under the radar and making inroads with two crucial elements of the GOP diehard base with his courtship of both southern bigots (his apparent fondness for the ideals and the flag of the Confederacy is well known and appreciated by many and is explored in a <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20060508&s=lizza050806&amp;c=3"><em><span>New Republic article</span></em></a>) and his flirtation with the kingmakers of the highly influential <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/21372/"><em><span>Council For National Policy</span></em></a> (CNP) a highly secretive group founded by none other than the reverend Timothy LaHaye the man behind those top selling âLeft Behindâ books that have done so much to mutate the Christian religion into something very dark and vengeful. The CNP is a virtual whoâs whoâ of far-right wing religious zealots and ultra-right wingers who make the John Birch Society look flaming liberals by comparison. Allen reportedly was a <a href="http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2006/05/council_for_nat.html"><span><em>guest speaker</em></span></a> at the groupâs 25th Anniversary dinner and is obviously trying to curry favor as the road to the White House quite obviously leads through the CNP.<br /><br />Allen would be a wonderful candidate for the GOP with his matinee idol looks, his admirers in key demographic segments and most importantly his carefully cultivated cowboy persona that has proven to be a huge asset in modern American politics. He is a political strategists dream and Karl Rove must be drooling at the prospects of that he could do with a man like Allen after turning the Yale educated idiot son of a family of Eastern elitists into the toughest cowboy and champion of the common man in the land when he molded the lump of toxic raw material that is George W. Bush into presidential material. He is ready for a break now and Allen would a far easier sell to an easily duped electorate.<br /><br />Everything was going smoothly for Allen until he spouted off and wandered off script during a campaign speech at a young non-Caucasian man who was working on behalf of Allenâs opponent in the upcoming election:<br /><br /><em><span>"This fellow here, over here with the yellow shirt, macaca, or whatever his name is. He's with my opponent. He's following us around everywhere. And it's just greatâ¦. Let's give a welcome to macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia."<br /></span></em><br />Whether it was a Freudian slip or simple arrogance the damage was done and the blogosphere pounced on this blatantly racist remark that has put the Allen campaign in full damage control mode where it has been spinning away ever since. Thanks to the innovations of âYou Tubeâ the Allen slur is still sprouting up all over the internet which incidentally is proving to be a far bigger nuisance to the Republican slime machine than they ever imagined back when they were using it in their attacks on the hapless Al Gore, trying to paint him as a liar for taking comments that he had invented it out of context. If there is any doubt to the power of the ânetrootsâ one need look no farther than that little fruitbag Joe Lieberman and the primary loss that sent the oligarchy and itâs legion of servants into a panic. </p><p>Allen was not only forced to issue a public apology for his remarks and to suffer the indignity of having to call S.R. Sidarth himself, the man who was the target of the âmacacaâ epithet to suck up with a mea culpa "from his heart.". According to a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/23/AR2006082301600.html"><em><span>Washington Post story</span></em></a> Allen also took to the airwaves on the notorious fifth columnist Sean Hannityâs nationally syndicated talk radio show to say to an audience likely comprised of the same angry white males who themselves are bigots:<br /><br />"I take full responsibility. I'm not offering any excuses because I said it, and no one else said it," a somber-sounding Allen told Hannity's audience of more than 12 million listeners. "It's a mistake. I apologize, and from my heart, I'm very, very sorry for it."</p><p>While George Felix Allen was dutifully groveling and crying crocodile tears his campaign manager <strong>Dick Wad</strong>hams was whining about a âfeeding frenzyâ over Allenâs making <em><span>ânational news over something that did not warrant coverage in the first placeâ</span></em>. Allenâs apology for his derisive, bigoted comments is just more of the same hollow, insincere bullshit that we Americans have all too often had rammed down our throats by cunning politicians who occasionally make a dreaded faux pas and believe that the majority is just stupid and lazy enough to shrug it off as though it were nothing. Emperor George W. Bushâs now famous quip that <em>âIf this were a dictatorship, it would be a heck of a lot easier - just so long I'm the dictator"</em> was blown off back in 2000 but after six years of the constitutional gutting spree, the illegal wars, the incessant propaganda and fear-mongering and the enshrinement of torture as a god given American right- nobody with even a smidgen of sanity is fucking laughing now are they? </p><p>The GOP can try to put on a dog and pony show over their so-called âbig tentâ that is fraudulently passes off as being inclusive to all and George W. Bush can make PR appearances in front of the NAACP to pander but Allenâs overtly bigoted comments are the true face of the Republican party and have been ever since Nixonâs infamous âsouthern strategyâ. Hell, if you took even a fraction of the racist planks out of the Republican party platform the entire fucking thing would collapse like a house of cards. There was a day back before Rove and the gay bashing theocrats decided to begin to work on recruiting black voters by trolling their places of worship and inciting them to unite against the evil homosexual agenda the only time that you would typically see a white Republican within a hundred yards of a black church would be with a gas can and a book of matches and dressed up in the finest of white sheets.</p><p>Most southern bigots can get away with explaining their rebel flag worship because they are ostensibly honoring their fallen ancestors, that is their equivalent of a get out of jail free card. Allen who is however a non-southerner with a taste for similar symbols does not enjoy that same luxury and voters have a right to ask what his obvious fondness for a flag that has come more to represent racism and recalcitrant attitudes than anything else. Somebody once remarked to a gathering that I was attending that the âStars and Barsâ represented heritage, pride and history, when I interjected my comments that <em>âso does the swastikaâ</em> the person launched into a profanity laced diatribe that included the words <em>"nigger loving asshole"</em> that was so intense that it even shocked a former sailor like myself. That being said just what is Allenâs reason for his displays of the Confederate flag or for that matter the noose that he once had hanging in his office. Is it pandering to the yahoos or is it something else, something much darker? He did once oppose a state holiday honoring Martin Luther King Jr., a great American and courageous American who is reviled to this day by many red-staters for his participation in the civil rights movement. </p><p>You have to hand it to John Kerry for coming out swinging over Allenâs bigotry and a big thank you to <a href="http://www.taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=24405"><em><span>Taylor Marsh</span></em></a> for providing this wonderful bit of information. The man who threw in the towel despite getting ruthlessly fucked over by the GOP machine in Ohio back in 2004 just laid into George Felix Allen:</p><p><em><span>"Welcome to our America, where immigration is a source of pride and not a punch line. Welcome to a politics where a young Indian American born in Fairfax Virginia can tell a US Senator: "I'm just as American as you are." And welcome to Virginia where it's clear some Republicans need reminding about the "truths" a real Virginian-Thomas Jefferson-- wrote were "self evident" two hundred thirty years ago. And if you ever want a test of whether Republicans are ashamed of George Allen or just embarrassed by him, it comes on November 7th when we have a chance to say 'welcome to the United States Senate -- to his Democratic opponent, Jim Webb.'"</span></em></p><p>While Kerry was in the minority of those denouncing Allenâs racist comments outside of You-Tube and the blogs it was business as usual for the Republican mafia. George W. Bush not only didnât chastise Allen as once he did with former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott for his racist remarks but in typical Bush crime family fashion continues to work hard in order to <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uslatest/story/0,,-6031766,00.html"><em><span>raise cash</span></em></a> for his Senate Race. A White House staff mouthpiece named Dana Perino defended Bush when she issued the following canned statement:</p><p><em><span>âSenator Allen apologizedâ¦.and I think that itâs in everyoneâs best interest, in this day and age of politics when everyone is trying to improve the tone and discourse, to accept apologies when theyâre offeredâ<br /></span></em><br />Time to get out the hip-waders, itâs getting really deep when remarks like that start being thrown around by the dirtiest bunch of back-shooting bastards to ever have ridden into beltway gulch to rape, plunder and loot the treasury. Racism has been standard operating procedure for the GOP ever since 'Tricky Dick's' goons siphoned off segregationists enraged by the civil rights movement and they have wielded it with aplomb ever since by using coded phrases and all out frontal attacks like Lee Atwaterâs Willie Horton smear campaign that painted then presidential candidate Michael Dukakis as some crazed leftist that was going to throw open the doors of the nationâs prisons granting amnesty to every crazed dark skinned person to rape, burn and pillage white America. I think that nothing sums it up better than Atwaterâs own comments taken from an excellent July 2005 column by the damned liberal <em>New York Times </em>Bob Herbert entitled <em>âAn Empty Apologyâ :</em></p><p><em><span>âYou start out in 1954 by saying âNigger,nigger,nigger.â But by 1968 you canât say âniggerâ â that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, statesâ rights and all that stuff. Youâre getting so abstract now [that] youâre talking about cutting taxes, and all these things youâre talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [that] blacks get hurt worse than whites."<br /><br />âAnd subconsciously maybe that is part of it. Iâm not saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me â because obviously sitting around saying âwe want to cut thisâ is much more abstract than the busing thing, and a hell of a lot more abstract than âNigger, nigger.â<br /></span></em><br />There you have the states rights thing and the coded racism and if you extrapolate it forward to include the wide net cast for the fundamentalist red state rabble by the substitution of gays for blacks although the war against civil rights and entitlements is still on you have the current GOP strategy of demonizing a convenient scapegoat for all societal ills while the right-wingers and their fascist lackeys pick the public pocket and manipulate those who are the most ignorant into making the worst choices possible in supporting policies that ultimately destroy their own living standards. The effectiveness of this is a testament as to the power of hate and the use of subconscious fear as a tool.</p><p>Kerryâs bitch-slapping of Allen was classic and in my own opinion every bit as great as the blast when Allen opponent James Webbâs organization pushed back against an early <strong>Dick Wad</strong>hams led effort to try to slime Webb by attacking his patriotism (like all chickenhawks are prone to do to those that had the nuts to serve their country instead of hiding behind deferments or giant warts on their ass to get 4-F status) for opposing the ludicrous flag desecration amendment that the GOP armchair patriots were pimping around the 4th of July. Team Webb had seen the cowardly tactics of the Swift Boat scum and flew into action immediately with this blistering shot across the bow:</p><p><em><span>"George Felix Allen Jr. and his Bush-league lapdog, <strong>Dick Wad</strong>hams, have not earned the right to challenge Jim Webb's position on free speech and flag burning," Webb spokesman Steve Jarding said. "Jim Webb served and fought for our flag and what it stands for, while George Felix Allen Jr. chose to cut and run. While Jim Webb and others of George Felix Allen Jr.'s generation were fighting for our freedoms and for our symbols of freedoms in Vietnam, George Felix Allen Jr. was playing cowboy at a dude ranch in Nevada. People who live in glass dude ranches should not question the patriotism of real soldiers who fought and bled for this country on a real battlefield."</span></em></p><p>The dude ranch comment is just so apropos considering that Godâs gift to America, George W. Bush is also an utter fraud when it comes to riding tall in the saddle but Iâll get to that a while later. Kerryâs statement shows that at least some people in the Democrat party are slowly starting to grow a spine. Personally I never could understand why Kerry never made an issue over the entire BCCI/Iran Contra deal that he investigated in the run up to the 2004 election. Daddy Bush and many of the same thugs who are now movers and shakers in the neocon movement that have fucked up not only our foreign policy but our entire legacy and standing in the world community. It is a mystery but it will have to be one that I look at another time lest I wander too far off of the subject of George Felix Allen and into the entire Iran Contra mess. Incidentally, Allen has strongly supported arch-villain, traitor, felon and onetime Senate candidate for Virginia Colonel Oliver North which should be one more black mark against his ambition for power.</p><p>Ironic that Ollie North was illegally facilitating the sale of arms to the same Iran that the Bushists and neocons are now prepared to bomb in advance of the November elections, times change donât theyâ¦.Reagan and Bush Sr. also were chummy with Saddam in the 80âs which is an era during which American geopolitics and agendas were as convoluted as a nest of snakes. Everything comes around that goes around doesnât it? Allen getting bitten in the ass over Kerry denouncing his comments would be interesting Karma too given his admiration for a criminal like North.<br /><br />Kerry has also came out strong against Sore Loserman by denouncing his bitter smear tactics against Ned Lamont who defeated the slimy little prick that refuses to respect the democratic process:</p><p><em><span>Appearing on ABC News' "This Week with George Stephanopoulos," Kerry said: "I'm concerned that [Lieberman] is making a Republican case." "Joe Lieberman is out of step with the people of Connecticut," Kerry said, adding that Lieberman's Bush-like stance on Iraq, "shows you just why he got in trouble with the Democrats there."</span></em></p><p><br />Hillary's britches must be getting a little bit tighter watching a man like Kerry hog the spotlight and enunciate rather than triangulate. </p><p>But I digress.....</p><p>A sustained assault on Allen could diminish his political capital which would be a tough one to swallow for the GOP base and the party establishment.</p><p><br />He was a natural to be the latest version of the tough talking, faux cowboys and poseur macho men that have been churned out since striking gold with the iconic Ronald Reagan. Arnold Schwarzenegger of course would have been the ultimate in kick-ass macho but even in these dark and twisted through the looking glass times amending the constitution for the sole benefit of a foreign born son of a former Nazi in order to allow him to run for president is just too un-American for all but the most die hard of delusional authoritarians, guys like Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and other total fascist scum like Bill O'Reilly and the rest of the Filthy Fifths in the Republican media echo chamber. </p><p>The all-American cowboy archetype has led to nothing but trouble, revisionism and an excuse to engage in mayhem. It has brought us our own four horsemen of the apocalypse in George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, John Wayne and the Marlboro Man and Allen would love to sign on as another gun for hire.</p><p>The whole macho western bullshit image pretty much started with Barry Goldwater but at least he was the real deal and not some phony like<em> âDutchâ Reagan</em> the actor and pitchman or George W. Bush the Yale educated scion of eastern elitists whose movie set Crawford ranch was acquired just in time for his run for president or a total fraud like Allen who believes that wearing shit kickinâ boots, waving rebel flags, pandering to white supremacists, reeling off football analogies and tossing around ethnic slurs make him one of the good ole boys.</p><p>The American cowboy mythos recently took a body blow with the popularity and acceptance of <em>âBrokeback Mountainâ</em>, it is temporarily punch drunk and reeling.</p><p>Now that the varmint is cornered itâs time to go get a rope and string the fucker up. </p>
