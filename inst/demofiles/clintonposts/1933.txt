</a>Former Massachusetts Governor William Weld is paying visits and making calls to discuss his potential candidacy for Governor of New York. While born and raised on Long Island and wed to a great granddaughter of Teddy Roosevelt, he certainly isn't viewed as a New Yorker. His candidacy would pose two problems for New York Republicans: the carpetbagger issue and his liberal record.<br />
<br />We all shouted "carpetbagger" with delight at Hillary, and while it didn't stick, it will make us look hypocritical and him politically opportunistic. More importantly, however, is his liberal record as Governor of the most liberal state in the nation. Remember, he was nominated by Bill Clinton to be ambassador to Mexico, but failed to face a confirmation vote because Senate Republicans, led by Jesse Helms, opposed his nomination based on his left-reaching positions.<br />
<br />For anyone frustrated by George Pataki's left leanings, you'll pull your hair out over Bill Weld.<br />
<br />Stay tuned.</div>
