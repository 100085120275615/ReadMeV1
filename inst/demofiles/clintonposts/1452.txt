<blockquote>"There are things that I've done that have been hard for people to get into. They haven't liked everything. They want me to do the same thing over and over, and they think I'm inconsistent and erratic when I don't. That's a very narrow viewpoint, I think. Just because I don't do what people like, I'm not erratic. I am lucky to have new ideas. I just try to stay open." - Neil Young</blockquote><br />Photograph by Kilroy_60<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7027/1803/1600/Hello.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7027/1803/400/Hello.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Not since the pairing of George W.

But who could make this up?<br /><br /><div><a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/tennis/story/5732736?FSO1&ATT=HMA"><span>Wimbledon Threatens Crackdown On Cleavage</span></a><br /><div><br />The article specifically mentions <a href="http://www.maria-sharapova.org/">Maria "Make Every Shot A Power Shot" Sharapova</a>, <a href="http://www.tatiana-golovin.net/">Tatiana Golovin</a> and <a href="vhttp://www.mariakirilenko.com/info.php">Maria Kirilenko</a>. Normally I don't publish pictures that I have not taken. It appears, though, that the good people at The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club have more to worry about when it comes to Ms. Sharapova than breasts. What image does it create for the tournament when this type of behavior is being exhibited between sets, Dr. Freud?<br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7027/1803/1600/maria_sharapova_deep_throat_banana%5B1%5D.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7027/1803/400/maria_sharapova_deep_throat_banana%5B1%5D.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />The launch of Discovery was scrubbed today because of weather concerns. NASA is hoping to <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060703/ap_on_sc/space_shuttle;_ylt=AkiGop33w5XIL2oLF_064tKs0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--">launch the space shuttle</a> on the Fourth of July. If things go as planned it would be the first itme we've launched a manned mission our our nation's birthday. This is one of the most anticipated flights in history; failure could lead to the shuttle program being grounded permanently. {Note: $1.3 billion has been spent on repairs since the last mission.} Have been tuned into the space program for as long as I can remember; I for one hope this is a smooth trip from launch to landing.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I've looked at this note I made yesterday several times. Mexican citizens living in the United States were said to be flocking TO Mexico to vote in the country's <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060703/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/mexico_elections">Presidential election</a> today. It's the first time those living outside the country have been able to vote. With the raging debate about immigration reform and National Guard troops being deployed to build a fence along our Southern border there seems to be something wrong with this picture.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Reports out of Cleveland are that the Cavaliers have offered LeBron "King" James a 5-year contract paying $80 million. That's the most the Cavs can offer under the bargaining agreement with the players. Since James came North from Akron, after graduating from high school, the team has steadily improved and made the playoffs this past season for the first time since 1998. James is atypical in this era of athletes chasing the almighty dollar with no thought of long-term consequences.<br /><br />Kilroy_60 predicts this future Hall of Famer will be staying in Cleveland <span>and</span> eventually bringing the first NBA championship to the city.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Everything I read and see about Al Gore's <a href="http://www.climatecrisis.net/">An Inconvent Truth</a> is positive. It doesn't have any <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0361596/">Fahrenheit 9/11</a> feel to it. (What <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/">Michael Moore</a> has to say...and...<a href="http://www.fahrenheit911.com/">Fahrenheit's website</a>? Yes, that's right. The movie was a winner in Cannes; why wouldn't it have a website.)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0497116/">An Inconvenient Truth</a> on the web...<br /><br /><div><a href="http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20060702-9999-1a02truth.html">Gore's 'Truth' Is A New Kind of 'Action' Movie</a><br /></div><br /><!---- END STORY TITLE --------><div><a href="http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060630/ENT01/606300348/1036/ENT">Scientists Give Gore 19 Thumbs Up</a><br /><br /></div><div><a href="http://festival.sundance.org/filmguide/popup.aspx?film=6556">The Sundance Film Festival</a><br />...<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/25/AR2006012502230.html">Al was a winner</a>.<br /><br /><div>This is all well and good. It's one of the most important issues we will ever face. Meanwhile the United States Senate is spending time arguing over an amendment to The Constituion against flag burning. {sic} while ignoring global warming.<br /><br />For my money, if Al Gore is the Democrat candiate in '08 he loses. {Actually <span>loses</span> this time, I mean, not getting screwed out of winning} He says he's not going to run...Tipper says she doesn't know. Can you imagine Al Gore debating Hillary Clinton trying to win the nomination??<br /><br />In case you missed it the flag burning legislation failed to pass by one vote. It wasn't a partisan act to try and push this legislation through, of course. It was only a coincidence that the last time it came up was leading up to the 2000 election.<br /></div></div><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />12 years have passed since Monday Night Football was interrupted by a sloooooooooooooow speed "follow" along the freeways of Los Angeles. {It was anything but a "chase"} Al Cowlings drove <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OJ_Simpson_murder_trial">O.J. Simpson</a> around for three hours before parking the infamous white Bronco at the former football star's Brentwood estate. Simpson went in to have a glass of orange juice and get his head together before the police took him into custody for murder.<br /><br />It doesn't take much for a man to hit a woman let alone to beat on one as O.J. did Nicole. Clearly he didn't have the balls to pull the trigger as he kept threatening during the "follow". It's neither here nor there to me that the the Simpsons were of different races...O.J. killed Nicole and Ron Goldman. That was clearly proven in too many ways for any other conclusion to have been drawn.<br /><br />Alas, through the wonders of the American judicial system Mister Simpson has been free to search for "the real killers". Meanwhile things are such that he will never have to pay any of the $33.5 million from the civil judgement where he was found to be liable for the killings.<br /><br />There was an interesting item recently saying that Nicole's sister Denise is no longer consumed by hate for O.J. whom she has called evil while stating, "I think he's the devil walking around on Earth."<br /><br />What are the chances do you think that the person(s) who did these killings plays golf in Florida? Someday, OJ won't have some jackass prosecutor screwing the pooch or the best attorneys money can buy to save his ass. He'll be burning in Hell.<br /><br />We would have all been better off if he'd have splattered his brains all over the back of the Bronco and had it done with.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Watched the 1975 Thrilla In Manilla on ESPN today. When Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier got together it wasn't boxing; it was war. I don't look for opportunities to watch boxing. But, when an Ali fight is on television I don't find myself turning it off either.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Speaking of war...The United States Supreme Court weighed in this past week regarding The War On Terror. President Bush's plan to try detainees at Guantonimo Bay before military tribunals was determined by the Court to be illegal. What the President will do next is....go to Congress to get authorization to pursue this course of action? We'll see...sooner or later. Most likely later.<br /><br />Three things I have found most intersting about the reporting on this story..<br /><br />Chief Justice John Roberts did not vote on this case because as an appeals judge he blessed the President's plan with a "go ahead"...<br /><br />Only a small percentage of those being held are actually going to be tried for one thing or another...<br /><br />Among the majority who will not be facing trial, we do not know how we're going to dispose of them because for one reason or another they can't be returned to their country of origin.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Didn't get any updating done on the "to be continued" posts, but <span>this one</span> is done...written in the moment. And I've added a BLOGS OF NOTE category to my sidebar.<br /><br />One thing that's been escaping me for awhile is carrying on the tribute to Hunter S. Thompson. Without The Good Doctor I don't know that I'd ever have undertaken this endeavor. So, to close, a Hunter S. Thompson moment...<br /><br /><blockquote>"Work was impossible. The geeks had broken my spirit. They had done too many things wrong. It was never like this for Mencken.
