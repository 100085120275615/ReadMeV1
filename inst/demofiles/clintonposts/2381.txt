<span>In a display of chutzpah <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/opa/pardonchartlst.htm">unseen since the closing days of the Clinton presidency</a>, I bring you this...</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Why isn't anyone talking about the tidy little scheme former President Bill Clinton, U.S. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and the gaggle of corporations and foreign governments have to clean money and park it into Hillary's campaign for President?</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Here's how it works (in case some young, entrepreneuing reporter would like to do the leg-work):</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>1. </span>
<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/02/15/politics/main272386.shtml">
<span>Bill Clinton signs onto a speaker's bureau and commands $100k per speaking engagement</span>
</a>
<span> from companies like Oracle and Morgan Stanley. </span>
<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/3/15/125247.shtml">
<span>He also serves as an advisor to Dubai Ports World</span>
</a>
<span>. I assure you, he's not working with the state-owned DPW pro-bono.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>2. Hillary Clinton runs for - and wins - a Senate seat and immediately the </span>
<a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/671vzdtw.asp">
<span>speculation</span>
</a>
<span> on her </span>
<a href="http://www.votehillary.org/">
<span>presidential candidacy</span>
</a>
<span> begins. She also sits on the influential </span>
<a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/">
<span>Senate Armed Services Committee </span>
</a>
<span>and the </span>
<a href="http://help.senate.gov/" target="_blank" class="boldName">
<span>Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor &amp; Pensions</span>
</a>
<span>, where she sits on the </span>
<a href="http://help.senate.gov/Pensions_sub_index.html" target="_blank">
<span>Retirement Security and Aging</span>
</a>
<span> Subcommittee (note Bill's speaking engagement at Morgan Stanley, a brokerage and investment firm).</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>3. </span>
<a href="http://www.divorceinfo.com/nyfaqspropertydivision.htm">
<span>New York is an Equitable Distribution state.</span>
</a>
<span> In short, what is Hillary's is Bill's and what is Bill's is Hillary's.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>4. In addition to the </span>
<a href="http://www.tray.com/cgi-win/x_candpg.exe?DoFn=S0NY00188*2006">
<span>$25m+ that Hillary has in the bank</span>
</a>
<span>, she can also self-finance based on the precedent that John Kerry set in 2004 by borrowing against the Heinz fortune of his wife.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Is this clear yet? Bill Clinton is serving as a pass-through for corporate and foreign dollars into Hillary's presidential campaign. If anyone believes that people are paying for Clinton's insight into politics while his wife is sitting in the U.S. Senate and mulling a bid for president is dillusional. This is about ACCESS. And do I need to remind anyone on the illegality of corporate and foreign donations to campaigns?</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>This whole thing stinks and how. </span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>I'll be expecting a quick and thorough <a href="http://theepilogue.blogspot.com/2006/03/dumbest-belabored-press-release-ever.html">denunciation from Joe Wineke and Jessica Erickson </a>on this ethical lapse... Hey, where is </span>
<a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/">
<span>Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington </span>
</a>
<span>on this one? After all, they are </span>
<a href="http://www.citizensforethics.org/press/newsrelease.php?view=131">
<span>waxing indignant</span>
</a>
<span> over Sensenbrenner's trip to Europe. Oh wait, then they'd have to target Dems.</span>
