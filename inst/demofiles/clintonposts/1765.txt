</a>Hillary Clinton's Electability Rating (HER) was down slightly in the second week to 37.3% from an initial rating of 37.9%. The HER is designed to measure Hillary Clinton's predicted success in the general election should she win the nomination.  Similar to our 2008 Nominations ratings, it is derived from the Trade Exchange Network data.  The corresponding rating for John McCain is 58.3%, down 1% from its initial ranking.<br />
<br />We expect the ratings to rise and fall based on both a candidate's desirability among general election voters and the likely opposing candidate.</div>
