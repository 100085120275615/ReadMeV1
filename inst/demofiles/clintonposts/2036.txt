<a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2004/10/30/paglia/">Salon has an interview with Camille Paglia (sit through the lame ad to get a day pass, click here to read)</a>
<br />
<br />Readers of The Blogspirator may be surprised to learn that he is something of a fan of Camille Paglia.  Not that we always agree with her, but that she is at least informed, intelligent, and tends to make a decent attempt to support her arguments, and is usually an entertaining read.
<br />
<br />Not this time.  Paglia's usual intellectual rigor is dulled by her ABB (Anyone But Bush) hatred.
<br />
<br />A few examples:
<br />
<span>
<blockquote>
<span>First of all, I think Kerry will be a far better president than he is a campaigner</span>. This is a man with gravitas <span>who is totally prepared to be president</span>. He has <span>national political experience, historical knowledge</span>, and <span>personal contact with the wider world</span> -- unlike Bush. </blockquote>
</span>First, if Kerry can't even manage a campaign - what maked Paglia think he has any executive capabilities?  If he couldn't even be well prepared for the campaign, what makes her think he would be prepared for the Presidency?
<br />
<br />His "national political experience" is as a SENATOR. He has *no* executive experience.  Bush, on the other hand, was Governor of one of the largest states in the Union.
<br />
<br />Paglia claims that Bush has "no historical knowledge."  Paglia shames herself here, because Bush earned a Bachelors in History from Yale.
<br />
<span>
<blockquote>Where he lacks information, Kerry will inform himself -- unlike Bush. I think he will make good appointments -- unlike Bush.</blockquote>
</span>Kerry apparently didn't see fit to inform himself about the al-Qaqaa complex before he went off half-cocked.  Or about the fake CBS memos.  He never informed himself about fetal stem cell research, or cared to look up the actual statistics of people without insurance.  He never cared to research and find out that the return of the draft was a Democrat proposal before blaming Bush.  In the third debate when Kerry criticized Bush for once saying he admired Justice Scalia, Kerry forgot that he himself had voted to confirm Scalia.
<br />
<br />In fact, one could argue that Kerry isn't very intellectually curious at all.
<br />
<br />As for the appointements - Kerry is talking about appointing Joe Biden, a PLAIGARIST, to be Secretary of State.  Would we see Hillary Clinton on the US Supreme Court?  How about Ted Kennedy heading up the slot of Secretary of Transportation. He has lots of experience with bridge safety. How about Bill Clinton as Underdesk Secretary of Interns, while he's at it?
<br />
<span>
<blockquote>And Kerry will repair our alliances: He will win back respect for America abroad. He speaks other languages -- unlike Bush.</blockquote>
</span>Did Paglia just cunt-and-paste (we think she will appreciate that comment!) from the JohnKerry.com website?  This is just pablum. He will not "repair" any alliances.  This is a non-sequiter. How will he "repair" our alliances with countries that were stabbing us in the back to keep the Oil for Food cash coming?
<br />
<br />The Blogspirator could continue, but all of these errors appear in just the first few paragraphs of Paglia's article.  It's hardly worth our time to fisk the entire thing, but it was worth our time to point our the depths that Camille Paglia has descended to.   It's like Lawrence O'Donnell has taken over her brain, to the tune of  "Lies, lies lies, lies!!@#@!#!@#"
<br />
<br />Yo Camille, you were formerly The Blogspirator's favorite non-pornographic lesbian! What happened??? Did you fall and hit your head?
