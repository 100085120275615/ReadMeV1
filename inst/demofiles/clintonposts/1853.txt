</a> In waiting rooms and lobbies across the country, it is still the "Summer of the Shark" and Michael Jordan, failing to learn from past mistakes, toys with ending his second retirement.<br />
<br />Reality changes during a doctor's appointment. Certain world events have yet to happen, according to the paltry selection of periodicals.<br />
<br />For that brief time, Mother Nature hasn't thrown a powerful hurricane at New Orleans or whipped up a giant wave in the Indian Ocean.<br />
<br />Arizona's top ten golf courses are still ranked as if it's 2003.<br />
<br />Love is in the air. Publications tout the rock solid marriages of Brad and Jennifer, Nick and Jessica.<br />
<br />A Reader's Digest shares the heartwarming story of rescuers saving those miners, who floated helplessly in cold water until rescuers could drill deep enough to save them.<br />
<br />The election of 2004 is a cliffhanger. Will Kerry pull it off?<br />
<br />The world according to the waiting room flows through time at a relaxed pace, like an afternoon baseball game.<br />
<br />You miss a few things from the stands on that sunny day, while grabbing a beer or watching two fans fight over a foul ball.<br />
<br />The lobby thrusts you back to life before technology made things so on-demand.<br />
<br />I can close my eyes and envision myself in the Wild West, waiting for major events to gradually reach my small town. Fewer distractions torpedo into my immediate surroundings.<br />
<br />Information is leisurely updated.<br />
<br />The gaps of time mean I can correct past mistakes before reaching the exam room, which, in essence, is a second waiting room.<br />
<br />I can quit smoking and start jogging, retroactive to March 19, 2005.<br />
<br />My imagined reality shatters as a nurse throws a new stack of current events on top of the dusty magazine rack.<br />
<br />The waiting room world catches up, the tortoise momentarily reaches the hare.<br />
<br />I don't fear because I know it is only temporary. Time will again begin to lag, and in six months, I'll be in a fixed period of time again.<br />
<br />In short order, I'll be wondering whether Democrats will pick up seats this November or if Hillary will enter the race and ultimately lose.<br />
<br />The reprieve from updated information puts things into perspective.<br />
<br />A bigger question becomes whether any of those thoughts really matter.</div>
