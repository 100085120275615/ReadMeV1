Actually, I still don't have any particularly learned insights to share, even though a lot has happened since my last entry....  No particular personal insights, but perhaps a few comments:<br />
<br />
I guess the biggest thing is that the "Prince of Terrorists" Zarqawi is no longer slaughtering thousands of innocent Iraqi civilians who only want peace and freedom, and occasionally getting 'lucky'  and getting an American soldier or civilian contractor.  Yep, Unlike the previous 43 times that the media reported his capture or expungement, it is pretty sure that Zarqawi is no longer among the living.<br />
<br />
Lots of more information coming out about this, and there is no need for me to recap any of the facts and 'mainstream' media fantasies about it.  I'll just provide a link to a place that is serving as a kind of clearinghouse on the subject:<br />
<a href="http://hotair.com/archives/top-picks/2006/06/08/zarqawi-deadfor-real/">http://hotair.com/archives/top-picks/2006/06/08/zarqawi-deadfor-real/</a><br />
<br />
I do find interesting the reaction of the media and the 'usual suspects' on the subject:<br />
In general, the very same people who were just a few days ago saying that President Bush, SecDef Rumsfeld and our great military are horrible failures because they haven't managed to catch the great terrorist mastermind Zarqawi IMMEDIATELY changed their tune to : "OH, Zarqawi, was really just a half-wit, a figurehead with no skills and no real danger to anyone.  Having killed him is only going to make things worse because he will be replaced by someone really smart and dangerous, and now the terrorists are going to really be mad at us."<br />
<br />
Can't say that it is fact, because I didn't see it myself, but I hear that one of the newsreaders at one of the 'big three' broadcast TV networks actually shed a tear for her poor Dear Mr. Zarqawi when she had to report his demise.  One thing that I can say is a fact is that the blonde bimbo newsreader on the supposedly 'right wing' (at least that is what everyone left of center calls it) FOX news apparently thinks more highly of al Qaeda terrorists than she does of our military, because she said "It is confirmed;  Zarqawi HAS BEEN MURDERED" [by US military operations].  Unfortunately I don't have that recorded for posterity;  I was just plugging in my video capture stuff when she said it.<br />
<br />
As I was monitoring the various cable news channels I also thought it would be interesting to see what the folks over at the Democratic Underground  were saying about the death of their ' ally in the war against the evil George Bush'....  And I wasn't disappointed;  At least half of them believe that there never was a Zarqawi; <b><i>(hereafter "Zarky")</i></b>  that he was a creation by Karl Rove and Don Rumsfeld.  Of the half that do believe that Zarky was real, half of them really liked the guy.  My favorite post was:<br />
<blockquote><font color="red">"I for one can't wait to get my Zarqawi/Che t-shirt.<br />
<br />
This man was nothing more than a freedom fighter, comparable to the terrorists that founded America by betraying England once upon a time and resorted to similar guerrila tactics. This just makes me sick the way everyone is celebrating the death of this man who at least fought for the freedom of his people to choose their own form of government."</font></blockquote><br />
Never mind that this poster is an America hating communist, he is too stupid and ill informed to know that Zarky was a Jordanian, not an Iraqi, and that his main sponsor was the mullahs of Iran who have been trying to destroy Iraq for decades <i>(Most Iraqis are not the 'right kind' of muslim, don't'cha know...)</i>, and have been at war with the people of that region since centuries before Iraq existed as a nation.<br />
<br />
Again, I messed up with having no proof of this DU post....  The moderators of the site eventually removed it...  My guess is not that they disagreed with the sentiment, but they didn't want the utter stupidity and ignorance of the statement to come back and be used against them as an illustration of what kind of people inhabit the left.  Anyway, while I WAS archiving the thread there, I was overwriting it rather than saving updates as separate files.  (LESSON LEARNED).  But <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1646064/posts?page=46#46">THIS GUY WILL VOUCH FOR ME</a><br />
<br />
Anyway, Maybe 1/4 of the comments were from 'near normal' people who thought one less high profile terrorist  was probably a good thing... (but they questioned the timing.... " Just Bush distracting people from Haditha" or something like that.<hr /><br />
Speaking of Haditha;  While something bad happened there, it begins to look like it may be mostly lies....  A lot of us thought that there were a lot of inconsistancies and red flags when first reported, but later statements by the Pentagon  made us fear that maybe some of the charges were true, to some extent.....  Well, If The GREAT Investigative Journalist <a href="http://americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=5566">Clarice Feldman</a> and  Blogger <a href="http://www.sweetness-light.com/archive/time-corrects-its-mistakes-about-haditha">Sweetness and Light</a> are correct, not only is Haditha NOT the modern equivalent of My Lai that the left was hoping would destroy American military  and further encourage anti-american sentiment around the world...  It may be 95% fabrications by people who have a history of such attempts.<br />
<br />
Sure hope it turns out  to be a a bunch of lies, anyway.<hr /><br />
Hmm, I was going to say something about the New York Times publishing a story yesterday about the means and methods we used to 'get Zarky', but can't find the link now...  Just to boil it down, they published an article Friday that was one or more of the following:<br />
<br />
A: Treason;  The article based on 'information from unnamed Pentagon sources' amongst other things told the world that  we have a 'mole' inside al Qaeda, and enough specific operational information for the bad guys to identify who that 'mole' is, and also secret information on some of the technology we use to combat terrorist operations.<br />
<br />
B.  All just a pack of lies made up by the reporter and editors to try to look like the know something.<br />
<br />
C: NYT used as dupes by the Pentagon in a disinformation campaign to sow seeds of distrust inside al Qaeda.<br />
<br />
Obviously, I'm hoping it is the latter;  But even if it is that, there have been enough recent (not to mention many over the previous 65 years) instances of the New York Times printing treasonous articles and lies that if there were any true justice in the world anymore, the newspaper would be out of business and at least 10% of its staff and management in prison.<hr />Ann Coulter has a new book out: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400054206/ruidosointernetm/"><u>GODLESS: The Church of Liberalism</u></a>  Even though I'm a fan of Coulter's and really enjoyed her earlier book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400050308/ruidosointernetm/"><u>TREASON</u></a>, I wasn't planning on reading, much less purchasing this new one.<br />
<br />
But the comments of <blockquote><a href="http://hotair.com/archives/top-picks/2006/06/07/hillary-rips-coulter-for-smearing-terror-widows/">Hillary Clinton</a>:<br />
<br />
The comments of David Letterman : "I'd like to set her up with O.J.";<br />
<br />
That several of the members of the New Jersy state government are trying to ban sales or reading of the book in the state,<br />
<br />
And even the comments of a few (normally conservative or libertarian) Bloggers and commentators,<br />
</blockquote><br />
Made me run right out and buy a copy as a show of support.<br />
<br />
I'm about 40 pages into it; Typical Coulter in that it is harsh, pulls no punches, well researched and basicly true, if very 'in their face'.  I'm enjoying reading it, although it is not for everyone: because the language is pretty rough and the descriptions of some of the evils countenanced and even supported by liberals are too vivid for 'tender psyches'.<br />
<br />
There are a few places where I somewhat disagree with her, but they pertain to some religious vs. scientific explanations of things, not the politics, which is the main point.<br />
<hr /><br />
Well, thats about it for now....
