<br />By JAY GOETTING, Register Staff Writer<br />Thursday, January 5, 2006 1:07 AM PST<br />
<br />Ten wineries in Napa County will be put under a microscope to see if they are in compliance with the conditions imposed by their use permits.<br />
<br />Planning commissioners Wednesday drew the names of the wineries from a box containing the names of the nearly 400 Napa County wine-making facilities.<br />
<br />The names were put in a hat and transferred to a sheet of paper, which was folded up and set aside.<br />
<br />Only Assistant Planning Director Patrick Lynch saw the names, which he shared with Deputy County Counsel Rob Paul. 'I was sort of a neutral observer,' said Paul.<br />
<br />The primary focus of the inspections will be the amount of wine the facilities produce. The plan is to seek data from the wineries and go to state and federal agencies governing alcoholic beverage production if necessary.<br />
<br />Lynch said the county is not looking at the exercise as a punitive move, but rather an attempt to see if the permit process is working.<br />
<br />'When I came to Napa County, I felt we had wineries that were doing a pretty good job,' said Planning Director Hillary Gitelman, on the job just a year. 'It's a challenging endeavor.'<br />
<br />Commissioner David Graves, a principal at the Saintsbury Winery in Carneros, warned that following what he termed 'a gigantic year like 2005,' volumes of grapes processed could spike above allowed limits. He said such an unusual event only would only serve to even things out with the years of lesser volumes.<br />
<br />Gitelman said officials would be averaging statistics over a three-to-five-year period, which should allow for the anomalies.<br />
<br />'The county recognizes that annual variations can occur due to the grape harvest and the timing of finishing/bottling,' according to a county memo detailing the winery production process.<br />
<br />The total volume produced also takes into account that many wineries do custom crushing or have alternating proprietors. Gitelman said the county will take measures to eliminate the chance of 'double counting.'<br />
<br />Planning commissioners made no reference to compliance with other aspects of a business' use permit, such as special events, hours of operation and other areas often of concern to neighbors.<br />
<br />The list of wineries inspected will likely never be made public. 'We'll never reveal the names,' said Gitelman."</div>
