So now there is now a Help Wanted ad for a John C. Holmes wannabe to put his "little buddy" in a cast and vicariously give women jollies through what God endowed him with.<br />
<br />
All I can say is that I wonder if Hillary would want one that is double-edged on both sides. On the other hand, most of the women she hangs out with probably carry that in their purses or area anyway.<br />

First we cloned Dolly, now Willy. A cast kit with the name Clone-a-Willy is available on the Internet and is needed to enter a competition that promises to rock women&#039;s worlds and give the winner a head start.<br />
<br />
According to the British tabloid Sun newspaper, &quot;the hunt is on for the fella with the perfect manhood - to model for a new sex aid&quot;.<br />
<br />
"Blokes who reckon they measure up will have to take a cast of their pride and joy at home, then send it to bosses at the sex shop chain Hustler Hollywood to be judged."<br />
<br />
"The only time I'd ever put my penis in plaster ... would be if it was broken, like one's arm"<br />
<br />
The winning entry, writes the paper, will be &quot;the model for a series of battery-powered rubber replicas that may find their way into thousands of women's bedrooms&quot;.<br />
