<div>Since 1994, the U.S. Senate has been controlled by Republicans except for a brief interlude in 2001-2002 when the Jeffords Switch gave the Democrats a slender 50 seat majority. In the 2002 midterm elections, Republicans won all of the close Senate races and regained a 51-49 majority. On Tuesday, the Republicans must defend their slender 51 seat majority in the midst of a closely contested national election.
<br />
<br />Here are my predictions for the key Senate races of 2004 and how I think the ultimate Senate make-up will look like in the next Congress:
<br />
<br />1) Oklahoma: Republican Senator Don Nickles, who has represented Oklahoma in the Senate since 1980, is retiring. Oklahoma is a strongly conservative and Republican state. It has backed Republican presidential candidates since the 1950s. In 2002, Oklahoma elected Democrat Brad Henry as governor. The candidates to replace Don Nickles are Republican Tom Coburn, former congressman from the 2nd District of Oklahoma from 1994 to 2000, and Democrat Brad Carson, who won Coburn's House in 2000 upon his retirement. Brad Carson is not a John Kerry Democrat but a moderate to conservative Oklahoma Democratic Congressman. Tom Coburn was first elected with the Gingrich wave in 1994 and proceeded to give both Republicans and Democrats heartburns with his attacks on federal spending and his firebrand advocacy for Christian conservative causes. Carson is an attractive Democrat who is the type of Democrat that can plausibly pass as acceptable to Oklahoma's conservative electorate by distancing himself from the far left liberalism of national Democrats like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton. Coburn is your pain-in-the-ass Republican who will give the Republican leadership in the Senate heartburn for their big-government spending spree since 9/11. Polls show a close race with Coburn clinging to a slender lead. My prediction: Coburn wins a narrow victory due to the Bush landslide in Oklahoma, and Republicans hold the seat. <strong>GOP HOLD</strong>
<br />
<br />2) Colorado: Republican Ben Nighthorse-Campbell is retiring, leaving a vacancy that Republicans do not have the candidate to fill. Democrat Ken Salazar, the state attorney general, is facing inexperienced candidate Pete Coors (yes, the beer Coors family). My prediction: Despite Colorado leaning Republican nationally, Salazar wins because he is the better candidate. <strong>DEMOCRATIC PICK-UP</strong>
<br />
<br />3) Alaska: In 2002, Republican Senator Frank Murkowski was elected governor of strongly Republican Alaska. His first act upon taking office as governor was to promptly appoint his daughter Lisa Murkowski to fill the Senate vacancy caused by his recent promotion. This is first time in U.S. history that a governor appointed their child to the Senate. This nepotism went over in Alaska about as well as John Kerry's presidential campaign has. Senator Lisa Murkowski is running for election for a full term to the U.S. Senate and is being challenged by Democrat Tony Knowles, governor of Alaska from 1994 to 2002. Polls have shown Knowles with a consistent slender lead. My prediction: Nepotism loses, Knowles wins. <strong>DEMOCRATIC PICK-UP</strong>
<br />
<br />4) Illinois: Ever since Republican Senator Peter Fitzgerald announced he would be retiring from the Senate after serving 1 unimpressive term, Republicans have been scrambling to find a decent candidate to replace him. They failed. Democrats nominated state senator Barack Obama, the multi-racial, multi-cultural wonder boy whose considerable political skills as a newly minted U.S. Senate nominee earned him a starring role in the Democratic Convention this past summer and rumors of future national potential as early as 2008. The Illinois Republican struck out three times in its effort to recruit a viable candidate to take on Obama - first with Jack Ryan, who dropped out after details of his messy divorce to his Borg actress wife ("Seven of Nine" on "Star Trek Voyager"), second with former coach Mike Ditka (?), and now third with Alan Keyes. Alan Keyes - where do we begin to describe the nuclear meltdown of his campaign? This carpet bagger from Maryland is known nationally as a black conservative media pundit who ran for president in the Republican primaries in 2000. His novelty is that he is a black Republican with a Ph.D. who regularly competes with Pat Robertson for the "Who Can Say the Most Outrageous Things in American Politics" award. Electorally, Dr. Keyes is an al-Qaeda dirty bomb whose disastrous Senate "campaign" (although using the word campaign to describe what Keyes is doing in Illinois demeans political campaigns all over the nation) threatens to drag down what is left of the Republican party in Illinois with him. So far in the campaign, Keyes has made national notoriety and earned himself a special place in Dick Cheney's heart for calling Dick Cheney's gay daughter a selfish hedonist. On the local scene in Illinois, Keyes made the brilliant decision to support the legalization of machine guns in a state that is turning into the bluest of the blue. Obama has led anywhere from 40-50 points in all of the polls that any non-thinking pollster has bothered to commissioned for this race (My favorite recent poll: Obama 66, Keyes 19). My prediction: Obama wins in a uber-landslide and is catapulted far on the road to the White House in the Alan Keyes Express Train. Dr. Keyes, meanwhile, gets a one-way bus pass back to Maryland courtesy of the Illinois Republican Party.  Hopefully, Keyes will be provided Secret Service protection for the duration of his bus ride out of Illinois so he is not killed by all of the unemployed Illinois Republican state legislators defeated in the Keyes fiasco. <strong>DEMOCRATIC PICK-UP
<br />
</strong>
<br />5) Kentucky: Republican Senator Jim Bunning was first elected to the Senate in 1998 after serving 12 years in the U.S. House of Representatives. Bunning is now 73 and up for his first re-election. This effort has been disastrous. Bunning's behavior in the campaign has been so bizarre that he makes Hannibal Lecter look like a decent replacement for him on the ballot. Bunning has run a lackluster campaign against his Democratic opponent, state Sen. Daniel Mongiardo. During the first Bunning-Mongiardo debate, Bunning looked terrible. He didn't even return to Kentucky for the debate. Instead, he read his responses from a teleprompter from a Republican party office in Washington D.C. As I watched Bunning's performance in the first debate, I was wondering what unlucky Republican staff lackey would be tasked the unpleasant assignment of changing Bunning's Depends after the debate had concluded. Bunning is clearly not up to the challenge of serving in the Senate. Kentucky is a strongly Republican state, however, and the Bush victory in Kentucky will help pull this poor little Bunning caboose over the finish line. If that occurs, let's pray that common sense prevails and Bunning steps aside so the Republican governor of Kentucky can appoint a viable replacement. My prediction: Bunning Wins Narrowly. <strong>GOP HOLD</strong>
<br />
<br />6) South Dakota: Democratic Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle has not been feeling the love lately in American politics. In 1998 and 2000, he was on cloud nine as the Democrats did extremely well in the national Senate elections and slowly whittled away the Republican Senate majority, allowing them to pull even with the Republicans in an unprecedented 50-50 split after the dust of the 2000 elections cleared. In 2001, Daschle was elated even further when Republican Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont switched parties and became an independent, which provided Democrats with a razor thin 50-49-1 majority. Since that time, things have been all down hill for Daschle. First, President Bush personally recruited several excellent Republican Senate candidates for the 2002 midterm elections. Then, Bush campaigned heavily for these candidates and managed to win control of the Senate in 2002. Now, Daschle is being challenged by John Thune, who served as a congressman in South Dakota's At-Large House seat from 1996 to 2002. In 2002, Thune challenged South Dakota's junior Democratic Senator Tim Johnson (who was personally recruited to run for the Senate in 1996 by Daschle). Thune came within 524 votes of defeating Johnson, amidst charges of fraudulent voting scams on the strongly Democratic Indian reservations in South Dakota. South Dakota provided George Bush a comfortable 25 point victory margin in 2000 and is a deep red state. Democrats like Daschle and Johnson have managed to build successful electoral careers in this Republican bastion by blurring party lines and focusing on being better candidates and out-hustling the Republicans in terms of bringing home the bacon from Washington. Tom Daschle has represented South Dakota as either a congressman or senator since 1978. Polls show Thune with a slender, slender lead while President Bush is riding a 19 point margin in South Dakota. My prediction: Thune wins. <strong>REPUBLICAN PICK-UP
<br />
</strong>
<br />There are 5 open Senate seats in the South that are Democratic vacancies (North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Louisiana, and Florida). Due to the fact that the Kerry campaign has written off the South and due to the fact that Republicans have fielded stronger contenders in each of these races, I am making the following predictions:
<br />
<br />North Carolina: <strong>REPUBLICAN PICK-UP
<br />
</strong>South Carolina: <strong>REPUBLICAN PICK-UP</strong>
<br />Georgia: <strong>REPUBLICAN PICK-UP
<br />
</strong>Florida: <strong>REPUBLICAN PICK-UP</strong>
<br />Louisiana: <strong>REPUBLICAN PICK-UP</strong>
<br />
<br />Synopsis: Republicans gain 6 seats, Democrats gain a total of 3 seats. The Republicans make an overall net gain of 3 seats. The new Senate majority in 2005: Republicans 54, Democrats 46.
