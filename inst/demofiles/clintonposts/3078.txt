<br />I for one am backing Steve Laffey in the Rhode Island Senate primary, and would love to see Chafee lose in the primary or general.  I disagree with the argument that we should back Chafee because he's the only Republican that can hold the seat.  Chafee IS NOT, and I repeat IS NOT a Republican.  Since when was a Republican anti-tax cut, pro-choice, pro-union, among other things?  For crying out loud, Chafee received the same rating from the American Conservative Union as Hillary Clinton.<br />
<br />We may lose this race if Laffey is our nominee, but at least we'll have a Republican as our candidate.</div>
