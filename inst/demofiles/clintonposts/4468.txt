<p>TODAY&#8217;S BROADCAST
<a href="http://www.family.org/fmedia/broadcast/a0038809.cfm?&amp;refcd=OL06XRDRC&amp;tvar=n">Preserving Families in a Hostile Culture &#8212; Senator Rick Santorum</a></p>

<p><br />
Senator Hillary Clinton borrowed the African proverb &#8220;It takes a village to raise a child&#8221; to argue that community and government play an essential role in the development of future generations. Senator Rick Santorum believes, though, that the traditional family is the key factor in the successful rearing of children. Echoing his recent book &#8220;It Takes a Family,&#8221; Senator Santorum today discusses how the family unit is a foundational building block of America and how the preservation of the family is necessary for sustaining our nation against ongoing moral decay.</p>

<p><br />
&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you can have a healthy society unless you have that strong foundational unit which is the traditional &#8212; or I call it the natural &#8212; family.&#8221;
