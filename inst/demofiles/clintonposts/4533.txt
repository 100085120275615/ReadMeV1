<p>I don't know how many of you watch Bill Maher's HBO show, but at the
end each week he has a segment he calls &quot;new rules.&quot; I've seen them all
before, but I recently rented his DVD special (of the same name) that includes all of his &quot;new
rules&quot; from Season 1 through the most recent season.. Some examples of the funnier ones:
</p>

<p>New Rule: Just because your tattoo has Chinese characters in it
doesn't make you spiritual. It's right above the crack of your ass. And
it translates to &quot;beef with broccoli.&quot; The last time you did anything
spiritual, you were praying to God you weren't pregnant. You're not
spiritual. You're just high. <br />~
<br />New Rule: When I ask how old your toddler is, I don't need to
know in months. &quot;27 Months.&quot; &quot;He's two,&quot; will do just fine.
He's not a cheese. And I didn't really care in the first place.
<br />~
<br />New Rule: George Bush has to stop laughing at himself. When you're
incompetence literally costs lives, giggling at it isn't cute or funny.
You know, there's a guy who's been running around the country
pretending he's the president, and I believe his name is George Bush.
And he wants everyone to know that he doesn't take himself too
seriously. Which is working out great, because now nobody else in the
world does either.
</p>

<p>You know, if the Republicans really want to joke around, I've got one for you. Knock, knock.
</p>

<p>AUDIENCE: Who's there?
</p>

<p>MAHER: Hillary.
<br />~
<br />New Rule: Instead of the White House hiring Tony Snow away from Fox
News, the White House and Fox News should just merge. Republicans
should also admit that they secretly picked the judges on &quot;American
Idol&quot; to reinforce their three favorite stereotypes: a black guy who
doesn't do anything; a woman who doesn't know anything; and a foreigner
who should go home.
<br />~
<br />New Rule: If you think Andy Card was the problem, there aren't
enough air holes in your bubble. For months, people have been telling
the president someone has to go. And that someone...is Andy Card? Yeah,
let's hold onto the torture guy, the no-armor guy, the Katrina guy, the
guy who exposes CIA agents, and the guy who shoots old men in the face.
<br />~
<br />New Rule: The only drug sold at Wal-Mart should be pot in the
parking lot. Wal-Mart has announced that they will now dispense the
&quot;morning-after&quot; contraceptive pill, because nothing says to a young
lady, &quot;I really care,&quot; like a trip to Wal-Mart. Besides, Wal-Mart
shoppers already have access to the most effective form of birth
control: watching how children behave at Wal-Mart.
<br />~
<br />New Rule: President Bush has to stop saying that, &quot;before 9/11, we
thought oceans could protect us.&quot; No, we didn't. Maybe in your world,
the oceans were like America's moat, and you were king, and Condie was
a Nubian princess. But in our world, we knew that our enemies, evil
though they may be, had figured out boats and flying machines.</p>
