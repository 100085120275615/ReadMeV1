<br />
<br />Today, in a blog post on the <a href="http://gadflyer.org">Gadflyer</a>, Paul Waldman, Gadflyer's founder and Senior Fellow at <a href="http://mediamatters.org">Media Matters for America</a>,  has a few choice words for Senator Russ Feingold.  Feingold has been a favorite of progressives for his principled stands against the Bush administration, including being the only Senator to vote against the Patriot Act.  As a result, many on the left view Feingold as the liberal alternative to Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic primary. <br />
<br />When Feingold was recently asked about whether he spoke with his fellow Democrats prior to announcing his censure resolution, he said that had he spoken with his counterparts before prior to announcing the resolution publicly, the idea would have been killed by Democratic consultants, adding, "[o]ur party is too beholden to Democratic consultants."<br />
<br />Cue Dr. Waldman:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>What a bunch of baloney. I'm the first one to be critical of Democratic consultants (heck, in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0471789607/sr=8-1/qid=1142028689/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-7273443-1222327?%5Fencoding=UTF8" target="window">the new book</a> I even have a little section of a chapter called, "First thing we do, let's kill all the consultants"), but Feingold just isn't telling the truth here. No political consultant can "decide to kill" a piece of legislation. Had Feingold told his colleagues he wanted to introduce a censure resolution and they disagreed, he would have been perfectly free to introduce it anyway. He's, you know, a senator and stuff.   <p class="text">So what was really going on? Let's remember what a great PR stunt this was for Feingold, regardless of whether you support or oppose censure on the merits. He got a solo interview on "This Week," and everybody was talking about him for days. He raised his profile, with lots of stories discussing his potential as the liberal alternative to Hillary Clinton in the '08 primaries.</p>  <p class="text">And here's something a colleague of mine suggested at the time, which sounds pretty right to me: <i>Feingold didn't tell the other Democrats, because he knew they'd react just as they did.</i> They were caught off guard, and got all defensive - I haven't seen the proposal, I don't know if I support that, no time to talk now, gotta run... So what happened? They looked weak and indecisive, and Feingold looked strong and principled, the lone wolf standing up to the administration. Just what you'd want if you were planning a presidential run.</p>  <p class="text">Now, it would be absurd to think Feingold would admit that, if it were true. But don't hand us some line of bull about how the big bad consultants would have killed your idea, so you had to hide it from the other Democratic senators. Not if you want to be the candidate of straight talk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="text"></p>Let me begin by saying that I like Senator Feingold quite a bit.  However, I am with Dr. Waldman on this one.  Russ Feingold is running for president in 2008.  I think that should be perfectly clear to anyone who has any level of familiarity with such things.  As a result, catching his Democratic counterparts offguard was politically advantageous.  It made Feingold look like a principled leader amid a party of waffling politicians unwilling to take a stand against an increasingly unpopular president.  Furthermore, by calling for censure, Feingold was able to appeal to the liberal base of the Democratic Party, who will be responsible for driving his campaign in 2008.<br />
<br />Politically, I do not blame Feingold for his actions; they made sense.  Likewise, I do not expect him to admit that the said actions were undertaken for political reasons.  For him to do so would be politically disastrous.  Nonetheless, for Feingold to maintain his reputation as a straightalking progressive, he will have to walk a fine line while playing the political game.  Those who like Senator Feingold for his resolute commitment to progressive causes may have trouble adjusting to a Senator Feingold who feels it is necessary to "play the game,"  but running for president necessitates one play the political game, and play it well.  Where that road leads for a politician who has built his reputation on his candor is anyone's guess.</div>
