I don't really care for Ruth Bader Ginsburg as a Supreme Court justice.  <span>Way</span> too activist for my tastes.  But even she says something I agree with on occasion.<br /><br />Saw a story on Special Report with Brit Hume this evening where Justice Ginsburg was giving a speech at Wake Forest University yesterday and defended John Roberts refusing to answer certain questions which might cause him to pre-judge cases which might come before the Supreme Court, calling it "unquestionably right".  The comment is also briefly mentioned in a <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,170749,00.html">story</a> about Chief Justice Roberts' confirmation at FoxNews' website.<br /><br />To say that I don't care for Hillary Rodham Clinton is an understatement.  I've despised that woman since 1992 for reasons I won't go into now (maybe I'm suffering from HDS?).  You couldn't pay me to vote for her for dog catcher, let alone to any higher office to which she might aspire. <br /><br />Leaving aside her political motives for doing so (which I'm sure she has), I do agree with her <a href="http://www.wstm.com/Global/story.asp?S=3894199&nav=2aKD">opposition</a> to the "International Freedom Center" being built at Ground Zero, opposition which seems to have finally convinced New York Gov. George Pataki that it was time to pull the plug on the thing (just <span>don't</span> get me started on his wishy-washy attitude about the whole thing up until Sen. Clinton's statement - it shouldn't have taken her, of all people, to get him to see that that whole idea was a <span>very bad thing</span>). <br /><br />I don't care for either of these women or their politics, but bravo to both women for saying the right thing when it needed to be said.
