For all the hype about Mike Huckabee's charisma and dark horsiness, the voters who know him best, the Arkansans who've had him as governor for a decade, seem rather nonplussed by the Huck.  <a href="http://www.arkansasnews.com/archive/2006/08/25/News/photopollpresidential.jpg">Polling</a> shows that the state would favor Hillary Clinton over Huckabee 49%-36%, and Wesley Clark over Huckabee 51%-37%.  Not a good start for the (other) boy from Hope.
