<div>Every Sunday morning, my DVR records the following news programs:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/">This Week with George Stephanopoulos</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608/">Meet the Press with Tim Russert</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/sections/ftn/main3460.shtml">Face the Nation with Bob Schieffer</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.thechrismatthewsshow.com/">The Chris Matthews Show</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't always watch every show - sometimes just parts of shows depending on topic and who is on.</p>
<p>This past Sunday, I ended up watching everything. On This Week, George S. interviewed Al Gore (Al Gore is promoting his new movie and book about Global Warming - The Inconvenient Truth) and he was asked about running for the presidency. Gore responded that he doesn't plan on it - but in my opinion, he left the door open. </p>
<p>On Meet The Press, Joe Biden was on discussing the usual current events (Iraq, politics, etc). Joe Biden has already announced his candidacy for President in 2008.</p>
<p>And on The Chris Matthews Show, there was talk about the 2008 Presidency - will she or won't she.</p>
<p>Then I logged on to <a href="http://einkleinesblog.blogspot.com/">Lassiter Space</a> and Jay asked the following on his <a href="http://einkleinesblog.blogspot.com/2006/06/inconvenient-truthiness.html">June 4th Post</a>:</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>Who do you think will be the democratic candidate in '08? And who would you like to see the candidate be? (i guess that's two questions, if you'll allow....) Is it gonna be Hillary? Al? How about Joe Biden or Wes Clark? Who are you liking?</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>I responded as follows:</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>I think predicting presidential candidates 2 years before the election is a dangerous business - almost impossible. So many things can occur in the meantime - look at Bush's approval rating a year and a half after winning the election. Also, look at the last Democratic presidential race - there was a time there that everyone would have said Dean was going to win and thought that Kerry was definitely going to lose. Things change very quickly.</span>
</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>
<span>Having said that, I'm interested in Gore, Biden and Clark - and when I say interested, I mean hearing more of what they have to say and saying that so far I like what I hear. The problem I'm having with Clinton right now is that she appears to be bending...kind of like McCain going to Liberty University. The one thing I used to admire about McCain (and still do about Biden) is that he told it like it is - he was blunt and appeared an independent thinker. Also, I don't care for Clinton's vote for the war and what she has said since about it (I know Biden voted for it, but I have more respect for what he has said since and what he has proposed since.)Also, at this point, I don't know if Clinton could win in the general election - but who knows...so much can happen in 2 years.</span>
</em>

<p>
<span>
<span>What are your thoughts? Is anyone even thinking about 2008 except for the political pundits?</span>
</span>
<span> It is  early - but it seems that people start talking about, analyzing and predicting the next election as soon as the old one ends.  It reminds me of how early Christmas decorations go up in stores - every year it seems to be earlier and earlier.</span>
