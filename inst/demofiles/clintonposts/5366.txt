I got in my car to go to work this morning and heard the news:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198651,00.html">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi Killed in Bombing Raid</a><br /><br />What a great day!  I remember the Sunday morning when they announced the capture of Saddam.  I'll remember this day, too.  Soon, I hope we'll have another day to remember when we get Osama.<br /><br />Here's a <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/2006/06/zarqaw_killed.php">great roundup</a> of blog posts at <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/">PajamasMedia</a>.<br /><br />Also, at <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com">FreeRepublic</a>, there is a <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1645488/posts">thread</a> to caption the <a href="http://us.news3.yimg.com/us.i2.yimg.com/p/ap/20060608/capt.6ac39bd6d16a45d7aabcddeb58799d1f.iraq_zarqawi_ny118.jpg?x=380&y=303&sig=dEqxNFgGzq18JULsUUTPjw--">picture</a> of Hell's newest resident.  Some of my favorites so far:<br /><br />Why do all these virgins look like Helen Thomas and Hillary Clinton?<br /><br />Do you guys hear something?<br /><br />Hello Adolph. Would you like to pitch or catch?<br /><br />Uday! Qusay! What are you guys doing here? Wait a second...<br /><br />Adolph, when do I bend over to pick up the soap?<br /><br />Abu Musab this is Satan. Satan this Abu Musab. You two have fun now...
