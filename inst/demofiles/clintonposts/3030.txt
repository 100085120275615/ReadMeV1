<div>Everyone knows Hillary Clinton arouses strong negative feelings from conservatives such as yours truly.<br />But I bet you didn't think the feelings cross party lines.<br />Well, according to the <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/columnists/view.bg?articleid=151737">Boston Herald</a>, they do...<br />
<span>âLying b**** . . . shrew . . . Machiavellian . . . evil, power-mad witch . . . the ultimate self-serving politician.â </span>
<br />
<span>No prizes for guessing which presidential front-runner drew these remarks in focus groups.<br />But these werenât Republicans talking about Hillary Clinton. They werenât even independents.<br />These were ordinary, grass-roots Democrats. People who identified themselves as âlikelyâ voters in the pivotal stateâs Democratic primary. And, behind closed doors, this is what nearly half of them are saying.</span>
<br />
<span>âI was amazed,â says Dick Bennett. âI thought there might be some negatives, but I didnât know it would be as strong as this. Itâs stunning, the similarities between the Republicans and the Democrats, the comments they have about her.â<br />Bennett runs American Research Group Inc., a highly regarded, independent polling company based in Manchester, N.H. Heâs been conducting voter surveys there since 1976. The polls are financed by subscribers and corporate sponsors.<br />He has so far recruited 410 likely voters in the 2008 Democratic primary, and sat down with them privately in small groups to find out what they really think about the candidates and the issues.<br />His conclusion? âForty-five percent of the Democrats are just as negative about her as Republicans are. More Republicans dislike her, but the Democrats dislike her in the same way.â<br />Hillaryâs growing brain trust in the partyâs upper reaches already knows she has high ânegativesâ among ordinary Democrats. They think she can win those voters over with the right strategy and message.<br />But they should get out of D.C., New York and L.A. more often, and visit grassroots members.<br />Because weâre not talking about âsoftâ negatives like, say, âout of touchâ or âarrogant.â<br />Weâre talking: âCriminal . . . megalomaniac . . . fraud . . . dangerous . . . devil incarnate . . . satanic . . . power freak.â<br />Satanic.<br />And: âPolitical wh***.â</span>
<br />Wow.<br />I don't even use that last one to describe her. And to think that a Democrat -- one of her political soulmates -- did is just plain mind-boggling.<br />In New Hampshire, where people tend not to be given to Kos-like verbal demonstrations... that's even more mind-boggling.<br />There is hope for us yet.</div>
