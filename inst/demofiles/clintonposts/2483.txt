<center>Thirteen Things about <strong>Shelley's</strong> Adventures At The County Fair</center>
<br />
<br />1.  Our office has a table at the county fair...which means that every staff member works two shift throughout the week.<br />2.  There are some staff members I like working with better than others at the fair.<br />3.  At our table, we make buttons for kids.  They can color and design their own button...and then we put it together.<br />4.  I am amazed at how excited kids get about making the buttons.  <br />5.  Two little girls came by and said that the only reason they wanted to come to the fair is to make a button.  <br />6.  I have never been to the fair before I started working there....so, in many ways...it's all new to me.<br />7.  The fair has rides and face painting, but it is mainly about agriculture and livestock...lots of cows and sheep...and tractor pulls.<br />8.  I had no idea what I tractor pull was and why someone would do it until my first trip to the fair.<br />9.  I love working at the fair...it is an evening of playing with the kids and getting to wear a t shirt and jeans to work.<br />10.  The fair is also a political time...candidates have been all over the fair.  I passed by Hillary Clinton on Tuesday and saw a bunch of others walking around last night.<br />11.  And I haven't forgotten about fair food.  I have been surrounded by fair food for 2 days...corn dogs, fried bread dough, pizza, fried cheese...fried everything basically.  <br />12.  Oooh...and they also have maple cotton candy.  The best stuff on earth.<br />13.  I only spent $4 at my 2 days at the fair.  I bought a cider apple slushie each day.  They are great...mmm...and actually healthy.  Most people spend $10 a day at the fair on food alone...so go me!<br />
