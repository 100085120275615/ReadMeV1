<div><p>Mike Adams is a professor at University of North Carolina-Wilmington and a modern Willie-and-Joe for <del>red state</del> sane America.&nbsp; My favorite among his many virtues has been that he makes a profit annoying the liberoids and uses it to buy guns.&nbsp; However, his recent announcement of candidacy for President exposed another, even more praiseworthy Adams policy: deport every single UN parasite from our shores and give their building to Donald Trump for a casino.&nbsp; <a href="http://townhall.com/opinion/column/mikeadams/2006/03/02/188353.html">http://townhall.com/opinion/column/mikeadams/2006/03/02/188353.html</a></p>

<p>This may seem like overkill.&nbsp; Until you consider the latest piece of printed spittle to ooze from the corners of their mouths.&nbsp; Doudou DiÃ©ne, sporting the title &quot;UN Special Rapporteur on Denmark&quot; has published an attack on Denmark for allowing their free press to be, well, free.&nbsp; Ace of Spades has a summary here: <a href="http://ace.mu.nu/archives/164466.php">http://ace.mu.nu/archives/164466.php</a></p>

<p>This would be nothing but funny, except those cretins are probably serious.&nbsp; And who or what the hell is a Doudou anyway, something that comes out the back end of a camel?</p>

<p>It's getting just a little irksome listening to the handholders who morally equate printing cartoons with committing homicide.&nbsp; But they just won't stop. According to them, Islamic maniacs preaching hate and murdering innocent people by the tens of thousands all over the world is not the problem.&nbsp; Danish racism is the problem!&nbsp; Torturing children is not the problem, no, that is for Allah and not for the UN to be concerned with; but cartoons in a nowhere little Danish paper, that is an outrage that forces the UN to create MANY PIECES OF PAPER!</p>

<p>Thanks to Doudou we now understand the primary threat to humanity: the woman-tolerating pale-faces with their devilish indoor plumbing and their fleece-intensive lifestyle.&nbsp; Curse those evil Danes, oppressing and bleeding dry the authentic dark man and his beloved goats!&nbsp; We could just beat the 5 million trouble-making blondes up north into submission, and all the world would be a peaceful, gloriously happy Hillary Village.&nbsp; </p>

<p>At least the UN says so.&nbsp; Me, I'm voting for Mike Adams.&nbsp; </p></div>
