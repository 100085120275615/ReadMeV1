I found an interesting <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/08/22/dems_yield_not_to_temptation.php">article</a> on TomPaine.com written by Robert Reich, former secretary of Labor under Clinton. He talks about what the Democrats should avoid doing in Congress if they do succeed in becoming the majority party again following the November elections. The type of "partisan wrangling" that would bring about a host of Bush-bashing committee investigations in Congress. I agree it would back-fire on the Democrats as it did on the Republicans when they went after Clinton so incessantly.<br /><br />It would not do good for the Democrats to just bash Bush if they took back Congress. Rather, as Reich writes, they should "use the two years instead to lay the groundwork for a new Democratic agenda...[in order to] put new ideas on the table... [and] frame the central issues boldly." This means taking Bush out of the equation and inserting real alternatives. I hope the Democrats can be competent enough to put forth such a coherent plan. Senator Biden's recent <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/23/AR2006082301419.html">editorial</a>  in the Washington Post laying out an alternate plan for Iraq is an important step in the right direction for the Democrats. It is a coherent and well structured plan to come to grips with the increasing sectarian divide in Iraq.<br /><br />But, as always, I do remain pessimistic about the Democratic Party. As this <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/40482/">article</a> from AlterNet attests, there are those inside the Democratic Party who too advance a corporate agenda akin to the Republican Party. These are Democratic consultants  who switch between politicians and lobbying firms similar to that of the K Street Gang.<br /><br />The <a href="http://realnews.org/rn/content/25demconsultants.html">report</a> for which the article is based off of says this trend began under the Clinton Administration. It comes under the guise of "centrism" that Lieberman and Bill Clinton embraced along with the DLC; to promote narrow corporate interests over public ones. It is narrowing the gap between Republicans and Democrats into what the article called "the Beltway Party" of big money and big business.<br /><br />Though I hope the Democratic Party does take the House since it will provide atleast a few degrees of change in Congress, these trends of seeping corporate interests are alarming. I think its important for people to understand this increasing corporate influence in the Democratic Party. If it continues, I think it may alienate many voters.
