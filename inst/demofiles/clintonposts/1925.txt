<br />The events of the past week in Britain should make us all realize that there is a new reality out there.  This reality is one we must all adapt to, or else face  certain loss of life, property and economic prosperity.  We must realize too  that even if we do adapt there is no guarantee that one of these days our luck will certainly run out. What we know generally is that the British foiled an attempt at a massive terrorist attack against the airlines traveling from the UK to the US.  What we don't realize is what we don't know, and aren't being told, and that is the sweeping scope of this and related events yet to be discovered.  We will most certainly awaken one day soon and find out that a major successful strike has occurred again.  One which will probably make 9/11 pale in comparison.<br />The reality of this is that with new security procedures and protections developed in response to these new and constant threats, we have to face the fact that the so called "freedoms" we once had (or supposedly had) are going to be curtailed significantly.  Like it or not the BS idea that some people have that we can do anything, anytime and however we feel like with no consequences, is soon coming to an end.<br />Eventually, the question is going to be, "Do you want to live?" or "Do you want to run around waving your wienie?" because you think you have a "right" to do it and you know your rights and no one can stop you and , Blah, Blah, Blah.<br />Soon all questions will be very simple and clear-cut and we won't need the ACLU and other far left or far right organizations to interpret them for us.  It will be down to, "Do you want to live?" or  (fill in the blank with any other question)  You one party hacks are going to find that this is the question that is going to be asked by any political party or person elected into office.  It won't matter, Hillary, McCain, Romney or Guillaini, whomever we elect.  Why?  Very simple, when the major destruction occurs today, tomorrow, next month or next year, it will be the only question left.  I hope all the Politically Correct morons go first.  Me, I'll try to stick around and live another day, even if it means I have to let the authorities check my bags, wallet or body cavities whenever necessary.  The rest of you can "Rights yourselves to death"  Bet the founding fathers would be proud of your stupidity!</div>
