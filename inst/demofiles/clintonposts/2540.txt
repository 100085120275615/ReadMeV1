<div>100% true story:<br />
<br />A few years back I was working for a lighting/staging and event production company. We were setting up the stage for a certain someone's press conference at Ellis Island (you know ... Statue of Liberty) and all of us were getting very frustrated by the politician whom this was all for.<br />
<br />It was a very sunny day and pretty damned hot as well ... the sun was bright and there really wasn't all that much shade to work with. Regardless, the politician wanted the podium to be in a shady spot. Makes sense, right? But this person had us assemble and move this massive stage a total of 4 times before it was deemed worthy. Keep in mind that we were on a schedule and each set up took a good 45 minutes to an hour ... with the break-down taking slightly less time. Additionally, we were all getting reamed for not being on schedule. We WERE on schedule! Problem was that the politician-du-jour kept making us move the damned thing.<br />
<br />Prior to our company taking on any jobs there was always a contract specifying where everything would be set up ... so it was obvious that we were sticking to our end of the deal. But it seemed like there would be no pleasing this shady pain in the butt.<br />
<br />Finally, we reached a spot that was deemed acceptable ... but during her speech <b>Hillary Clinton</b> had an assistant holding an umbrella over her head to keep the sun from singing her face. <br />
<br />Hold on ... maybe there's some vampirism going on here? The Lefties are vampires that are sucking the life out of America as we know (and love) it? I think I might be on to something. This requires further investigation.</div>
