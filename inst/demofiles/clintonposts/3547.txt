<div>Some musings on the American Music Awards which aired tonight.<br />
<br />- Mariah Carey â Love the tits, but shut the fuck up and sit down.<br />- Hillary Duff â Hottâ¦.but turn the volume down.<br />- Lindsay Lohan â Hott AND a good rendition of a Stevie Nicks song. I love me some Lindsay, she even made Herbie the lovebug good again.  <br />- Gwen Stefani won an award, how the hell she did it, I donât know, but based on this and the previous two comments, American Music is on a downhill slide.  Fuck Gwen Stefani and her little harajuku girls too.  (check my Love, Angel, Music, Baby review that I wrote while still in Iraqâ¦yes I paid postage to have that piece of shit shipped to me.)  <br />- Redeeming quality is The Holiest of Holy Guitar God Santana, performed with the Los Lonely Boys a song from his new album, which by the way is fucking Tits and Ass.  Now when Santana does a song with Gwen Iâll slit my wrists.  Stick with Michelle Branch and youâll be fine Carlos.<br />- Speaking of duetsâ¦.Sarah McLaughin (yes the labia licking lesbo leader) and Cyndi Lauper did a duet to Time after Time covering Cyndiâs 80âs tune with an acoustic vibe.  Fucking nice.  Iâm gonna have to get Cyndiâs new album.<br />- Sugarland won something, they are a country group, I thought they had their own awards show but ok.  <br />- Dave Navarro and Carmen Electra announced an award, cool motherfucker married to one of the sexiest women in the world.  Faith in humanity almost restored.<br />- Annie Lennox and the Dude with the Glasses came back together to reform the Eurithmics and performed Missionary Man and Sweet Dreams.  The show is redeeming itself in leaps and bounds.<br />- I didnât see Green Day in there too much, they, like Gwen, have pissed me the fuck off.  I liked Green Day when they were singing about masturbating on the couch and getting stoned.  Now they think they know stuff about the government and are all preachy.  Thank god for Blink 182 though they broke up last I heardâ¦..well there are the Killers, All American Rejects, and My Chemical Romance to listen to and not have to worry about being subjected to some silly Japanese fashion or someones political agenda.  <br />
<br />The good thing about music is, no matter how crappy the new stuff gets, they still sell the old stuff and there is always new âoldâ music to discover.</div>
