<span>The Zionists are a clever bunch. By sending their troops into

<span>Hillary Clinton is a kind womyn because she <i>gives</i>. As opposed to those greedy Republican monsters, Hillary will <i>give</i> us affordable universities and homes. As it stands, most universities and homes sit vacant and idle because no one can afford them. Once President Clinton opens her Package of Benevolence, everyone will be able to afford anything!<p></p>
