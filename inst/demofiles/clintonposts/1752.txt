<div align="justify">After over a month of polling, you chose <strong>Cindy Sheehan</strong> as the absolute <strong>Biggest Dumbass for the year 2005!</strong>
<br />With <strong>45% of the vote</strong>, <strong>Cindy</strong> easily defeated the competition, with <strong>Screamin' Howard Dean</strong> coming in a distant second place with <strong>just 14%</strong> of the vote. Then came <strong>Jimmy Carter with 12%</strong> and <strong>Nasty Pelosi with 8%.</strong>
<br />
<br />Now that <strong>Cindy</strong> has fully embraced her Moonbatism, she has visited with sworn enemies of our state (<strong>Hugo Chavez</strong>), has demanded <strong>Hillary Clinton</strong> denounce the War or lose the next senarorial election, and now has threatened to <strong>
<em>run for the Senate herself!</em>
</strong> Clearly, the long-ago expended <strong>15 minutes of infamy</strong> were not enough for this mad cow. <strong>Casey</strong> (a hero who deserves much better) continues to roll in his grave.<br />
<br />
<strong>Dearest Cindy:</strong> Without delving further into your misadventures, we simply congratulate you on winning this honor, and sincerely wish you all the worst possible luck with your current endeavors.<br />
