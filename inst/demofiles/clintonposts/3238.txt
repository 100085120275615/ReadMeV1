<div>I'm having one of those weeks where I'm suffering from a low energy level and am just plain tired of everything.  For instance,<br />
<br />I am tired of unloading the dishwasher<br />I am tired of telling the boys to stop jumping on the furniture<br />I am tired of sending the boys to their rooms<br />I am tired of doing laundry<br />I am tired of food<br />I am tired of trying to come up with ideas for the the next meal<br />I am tired of the month of August<br />I am tired of paying bills<br />I am tired of waiting until I can do what <em>I</em> want to do<br />I am tired of female hormonal fluctuations<br />I am tired of Islamic Extremists<br />I am tired of worrying about North Korea, Iran and the entire Middle East <br />I am tired of hearing about President Bush<br />I am tired of hearing about Hillary Clinton<br />I am tired of the same old routine<br />I am tired of being tired of the same old routine but unmotivated to change it<br />I am tired of being unable to leave the house without spending money<br />I am tired of already fretting over the upcoming holidays and associated costs<br />I am tired of my hair<br />I am tired of my curtains<br />I am just<br />plain<br />tired....</div>
