Historians will one day look at the week of January 20, 2006, review events as they swirled around Senator Clinton, and conclude there wasn't much out of the ordinary.<br /><br />In a fiery Martin Luther King Day appearance at a Harlem church, New York's junior senator claimed Republican leaders run the House "like a plantation," quashing Democratic dissent. For good measure, and apparently suffering a memory loss for the period of 1992 through 2000, she predicted the Bush White House will go down as "one of the worst" in history. I thought Clinton's sudden swerve back to her core African-American supporters was noteworthy after efforts to shed her image as a liberal, but political observers downplayed the notion that the comments will damage her. "I don't think it's going to have a great deal of impact because people who would be offended by the remark would never vote for her anyway," said John Pitney, a congressional scholar at California's Claremont McKenna College.<br />Of course there was an immediate pushback from the right. The White House said on Tuesday that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was "out of bounds" when she compared the Republican-controlled House of Representatives to a plantation and then harshly criticized the Bush administration. Syndicated columnist Michelle Malkin noted in 'The National Ledger' on Tuesday that she was "a reverse Sister Souljah at race hustler Al Sharpton's pulpit in Harlem."<br />But, as is their eternal reaction, the left circled the wagons around Madame.<br /><br />Leave it to Keith Olbermann to rationalize Hillary Clinton's comparison of the Republican-controlled Congress to a plantation, a comparison she made during what should have been a celebration of the civil rights movement. Utilizing a favorite tool of the left, moral equivalency, on his January 17 Countdown show, the MSNBC host argued that because former House Speaker Newt Gingrich once compared the Democratic-controlled Congress to a plantation, a comment that had nothing to do with any racial issue, that reaction from the GOP in criticizing Clinton was perhaps "too swift," as he implied that the Republicans live in a "glass house."<br /><br />All of this was predictable with blacks rallying around the wife of America's first black President. What wasn't predictable was the reaction of NYC Councilman Charles Barron, who just happens to be black.<br /><br />"I think her speech was contrived and condescending," City Councilman Charles Barron told ABC Radio's Sean Hannity on Tuesday.<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://shootingstarnews.com/blogs/hillarytalk/images/vert.clinton.ap.jpg" /><br /><br /><b>Madame has been particularly</b> industrious trying to escape the stigma that all Democrats must bear that they're weak on defense. She managed to get herself on the Senate Armed Forces Committee after she was elected in 2000. In this period, she apparently gave herself a field promotion to general and has lately been opining on defense matters.<br /><br />J. James Estrada also thinks Clinton is playing a role these days as a hardliner on Defense. To quote: She supports the War in Iraq. She is playing the role of commander-in-chief. She calls for more armor protection for the troops. She is playing the role as moral arbitrator. She is against violent video games. When this masterful peacock dance is over and she has maneuvered herself past the iron gates at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave, will the nation then wonder how we did this to ourselves? A bad actress has won Oscar before proving that all the glitters is not gold. Let's not let life imitate art in that regard.<br />Not content with second-guessing Operation Iraqi Freedom, she then turned her attention on Iran. Clinton called for United Nations sanctions against Iran as it resumes its nuclear program and faulted the Bush administration for "downplaying" the threat. In an address Wednesday evening at Princeton University, Clinton, D-N.Y., said it was a mistake for the United States to have Britain, France and Germany head up nuclear talks with Iran over the past 2 1/2 years. Last week, Iran resumed nuclear research in a move Tehran claims is for energy, not weapons. "I believe that we lost critical time in dealing with Iran because the White House chose to downplay the threats and chose to outsource the negotiations," Clinton said. John Spencer Wasn't impressed: Recently, Senator Clinton stated, "One of the areas I am deeply concerned about is Iran and its pursuit of nuclear weapons, because a nuclear-armed Iran would shake the foundation of global security to its very core. A nuclear armed Iran is unacceptable."<br /><br />Talk is cheap. She voted against the Bunker Buster bombs needed to destroy their nuclear facilities before Iran gets the bomb. Senator Clinton proclaimed devotion to our troops while slashing defense and even opposing the McCain Amendment to get our troops off food stamps by giving them a raise.<br />But Iraq and Iran are small change for Mrs. Clinton The American Thinker noted â<br /><br /><br /><img src="http://shootingstarnews.com/blogs/hillarytalk/images/r469963390.jpg" />Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) greets people as she arrives for U.S. President George W.

She must think they are very stupid. Her contrafactual assertion that President Bush is continuing the foreign policy of Jummy Carter elicited no apparent guffaws.<br /><br />âHistory has weighed heavily on the Middle East. What we have tried to do over the last 30 years, starting with President Carter, moving through other presidents, including my husband, and now this president, is to send a uniquely American message: `It can get better. Just get over it.'â<br /><br />GP responds:<br />It's hard to see how President Bush has continued the âCarter Policyâ of appeasement in the Middle East. And, I am sure that at least two individuals would agree with me, Saddam Hussein and Mullah Omar! It is insulting that Hillary would clump her husband's policies in the same bucket as the Bush Doctrine. What were his policies, anyway? Does anyone remember anything about Bill Clinton's Mideast policy besides the numerous photo ops and Arafat visits to the White House? On the other hand, The Bush Doctrine has done more to bring positive democratic change to the Middle East in <a href="http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/06/01/04/10009235.html" target="new">the last year </a>than the previous administrations from Carter through Clinton.<br /><br />And then just when Madame's week took on surrealistic tones, along came this unexpected endorsement.<br /><br />Jan 18 (CTK) - Former Czech president Vaclav Havel told CTK that Senator Hillary Clinton ought to succeed George W.

Some were even less impressed.<br />I will not support Hillary Clinton for president January 20, 2006 AUSTIN, Texas --- I'd like to make it clear to the people who run the Democratic Party that I will not support Hillary Clinton for president. Enough. Enough triangulation, calculation and equivocation. Enough clever straddling, enough not offending anyone This is not a Dick Morris election. Sen. Clinton is apparently incapable of taking a clear stand on the war in Iraq, and that alone is enough to disqualify her. Her failure to speak out on Terri Schiavo, not to mention that gross pandering on flag-burning, are just contemptible little dodges.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.freepress.org/columns/display/1" target="new">Molly Ivins </a>.
