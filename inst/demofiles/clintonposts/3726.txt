<div>Well, I have been sick all week and therefore watching TV. And music videos. And holy crap there is a lot of god awful stuff out there.<br />And people are eating this crap up! And sorry girls, you seem to be the worst perpetrators of this. I mean it seems, if you look at billboard's top 100 chart, I am wrong. But I always like to believe I am right so here's my list of top offenders.<br />
<br />

<span>#1 Fergie from Black Eyed Peas.</span>
<br />Is she on crack? Why on earth would any self respecting woman utter <a href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/blackeyedpeas/myhumps.html">lyrics</a> such as the ones in My Humps? Don't get me wrong, I went to a 2 Live Crew concert last year, I understand having fun with sexuality and I like a nice ass, but this song is just so effing bad.<br />Are her humps her ass cheeks or her boobs anyway? She says the word humps way too many times. I seem to remember a time before Fergie when Black Eyed Peas were somewhat tolerable (if only because they were rarely played). Fergie needs a lobotomy.<br />

<br />#2 Pussycat Dolls</span>
<br />Since when did these ho bags get off the pole and into the studio. They should stick to taking their clothes off and prancing about. They were performing a great service for young Hollywood celebrities by providing a venue for them to act like the even sluttier versions of their normal persona in a strip club like atmosphere.<br />Because their new single is called Stickwitu they should all be sentenced to the champagne room for eternity. Just joking I actually love strippers, but Pussycat Dolls suck ass!<br />

<span># 3 Ashlee Simpson</span>
<br />I don't know what to say. Who likes this shit? She has a god awful voice. And if my boyfriend so much as looked twice at you, I would have serious doubt about his sanity. You are gross and I would rather watch your dumb-ass sister say stupid stuff than ever have to hear your voice again.<br />Good luck with Fez sweetie.<br />

<span># 4 Hillary Duff</span>
<br />I like Hillary. She is cute, seems to have her head on straight, and I actually really liked her as Lizzie Maguire. That being said, her single Beat of My Heart sucks! I thought her song Come Clean was cute and I was really hoping that since she has been dating a rocker that her new album would be edgy. Sweetheart, if that is the beat of your heart, get a pace maker.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6704/699/1600/ALANIS.jpg">

</a>
<span># 5 Alanis Morisette</span>
<br />Well, this one is tricky. I new her from choir when we were really young, she seemed nice, by high school she was a ho bag who tried to steal my boyfriend and start fights in a bar with me.<br />But all that aside, she did have some alright tunes and she seems really nice now, so good for her.<br />But we do not need a cover of Seal Alanis! His version is better and your video sucks. Just because you look like a lesbian does not mean you need to intimate a connection.<br />Anyway, what the air waves do need is something more like your old stuff, original. Get to work. Although I don't blame you, your fiance is hot and you are rich, so really I would be lazy and sing cover songs too.<br />

</a>
<br />
<span>Shakira</span> - She is cute and when I was in Latin America I liked her Spanish music. For some reason when I heard her English language music it sucked big time. But her new single Don't Bother and the video for it is pretty good. For bad pop, which I like to indulge in sometimes.<br />

</a>
<span>Madonna</span> - Hung Up is really catchy and makes me want to dance. Yeah for Madonna this song isn't pure crap. Some of her recent albums have made La Isla Bonita sound like Mozart's fifth.<br />
<br />

</a>
<span>Fiona Apple</span> - She's alright. Not my favorite, but she is good at what she does. And Ugly Girl is funny stuff! I could have written this song about one of my ex's!<br />

</a>
<span>Gwen Stefani</span> - I was ready to call it quits with her and her crazy ass outfits and her obsession with Japanese teenage girls. But it might be over, or so I hope. The new single Luxurious is catchy and chill and appeals to my hip hop sensibilities. Makes me want to eat ribs in BY. Umm ribs...<br />

</a>
<br />
<br />
<span>Mariah Carey</span> - I don't actually like her music, per se, however I think she is cute and keeps it real. She is a Diva, but honest with her fan base about her problems and she came back from that breakdown with a lot of dignity.<br />

<img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6704/699/320/kathleenEdwards.jpg" alt="" border="0" />
</a>
<span>Kathleen Edwards</span> - She is Canadian and she is super nice and down to earth and has a real rocker's heart. She's the real deal and I like who she writes songs about guys with names like Billy who are in trouble with the law. A little too country though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6704/699/1600/Imogen%20Heap.jpg">
<img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6704/699/320/Imogen%20Heap.jpg" alt="" border="0" />
</a>
<span>Imogen Heap</span> - Because her sound is original and she wrote and produced all her own tracks and had to refinance her flat to do so. But still for me it is super girly/artsy fartsy.<br />
<span>
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6704/699/1600/MEG.jpg">
<img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6704/699/320/MEG.jpg" alt="" border="0" />
</a>Meg White</span> - Cause she is a drummer and has to travel around with her brother all he time (who I suspect could be a little weird). Girls that drum are cool.<br />
<br />

</a>
<span>Michelle Branch</span> - She is cute has a nice voice and gets to sing with Santana.<br />
<br />
<span>Avril Lavigne</span> - She has a spritely look and attitude. Also Canadian. Catchy songs that get stuck in your head!!! And there is a movie being made based on her song Skater Boy. Now that is too funny!<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6704/699/1600/AVRIL.jpg">
