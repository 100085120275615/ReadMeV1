<div>Ok not really.<br />
<br />I love the folks in my neighborhood. We are all very close and watch out for each other. I even have a little neighbor kid who has had a crush on me as long as he has lived here. He is a doll. I love his mom too - she is exactly the kinda mom I would love to be - she is laid back - has her own life and guides her children very well while still giving them independence and enough room to fuck up and and learn from their mistakes.<br />
<br />But her parenting style is not the point of my post.<br />
<br />Today when I came home I saw her and another mom in the neighborhood talking in front of my house. I like them both. A great deal actually. They each have two kids I have watched both of their broods grow since infancy and now have great kids who play ball and ride bikes all over the neighborhood.<br />
<br />We got to talking and they pulled what I have always feared would happen. They pinned me down about motherhood. Actually they both asked (as I KNOW they have been dying too...) "When you gonna get on that?"<br />
<br />You see - I am the ONLY woman left on my street of child bearing age that has not gone the way of the stork. As I himmed and hawwed my answer out I could see they were both DYING to know. DYING. Waiting on every word dying. There used to be two couples on the entire street who had been married for at least 3 years who had not had kids. The other couple gave up the ghost a year ago and spawned life. That leaves me and the King of Annaland alone in our silent, blissful, child free world.<br />
<br />We as a neighborhood we all wave and smile at each other on a daily basis. We pleasantly say hello and mention to our significant others who we talked to and what the neighborhood gossip is. And I received confirmation today that one of the topics that has crossed everyone's lips is: What is up with 'them'? Are they ever gonna have kids?<br />
<br />I couldn't answer them like I would to people who really know me. I had to be politically correct. Pleasant and honest all at the same time. This is what I told them and it even surprised me. "Hmm, I don't know."<br />
<br />I DON'T KNOW??!!! DON'T KNOW!!!??<br />
<br />What the fuck kinda witty, shut the fuck and don't ask me stupid questions answer is that Anna?! I was so disappointed in my response. My response needed to have some sort of swift, polite, don't ask me that stupid question again tone that would have shut them up. And I failed. I thought I was a super hero of wit and banter. And they hit my weak point and I crumbled like a cracker in their tractor beam mommy gaze.<br />
<br />Instead I offered to let one of the lady bring her kids over to scheduled playtime with my dogs as a "chore" for them to learn committed regular responsibility. I committed to being an extra pair of eyes on the street when I am around whilst the kids play as part of the "it takes a village" teamwork that is post Hillary Clinton hell.<br />
<br />It is so unlike me to openly be nice to a mommy. I don't hate them. I just don't want them to KNOW I don't hate them. Yes, I have issues. Shut up. My therapist is doing all she can.<br />
<br />But to me, it is tantamount to fraternizing with the enemy. I am an enemy of the state of Anna. I should be sent to Gitmo. <br />
