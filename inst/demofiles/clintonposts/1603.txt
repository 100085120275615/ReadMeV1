<p>back to the point<br />
I am one of those who is extremely disappointed in John McCain<br />
Altho I did disagree with alot of his positions, I respected the fact that he was a straight talker, so that at least I would listen to what he had to say and ACTUALLY consider his position and any merits it might contain &#8212; and THAT is what is needed if we are to get out of this partisan BS mess.<br />
However he has become such a suck-up lackey lap dog of the Bush whitehouse &#8212; I have just lost any and all respect for the man &#8212; especially after what Bush and Co did to him in the primaries, that he could even offer any support to that slimeball only indicates the depth that he has sunk, and the complete loss of any dignity he might have once owned.<br />
I don&#8217;t know why or how Hillary got into this discussion &#8212; I would rather not see her run just because I believe it WILL energize the far right &#8220;never vote FOR a democrat &#8212; would rather elect a bumbling idiot (proven in 2000 and 2004) than ANY democrat&#8221; type of voter to come to the polls.<br />
