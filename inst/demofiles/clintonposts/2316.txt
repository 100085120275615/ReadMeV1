<span>It is a Drumbeat</span>
</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>
<span>I can see it now. The drumbeat is beginning. People want Al Gore to run and they are asking the question...what would  America be like today if we had President Gore? Can you say, "peace and prosperity"?<br />
<br />Look at this <a href="http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/">item from today's Hotline</a>.<br />
<br />
</span>
</span> <span>
<span>And a </span>
<strong>President Gore </strong>
<span>or </span>
<strong>President McCain </strong>
<span>would make us safer than a </span>
<strong>President Kerry </strong>
<span>or President </span>
<strong>Hillary Clinton.</strong>
<span>  </span>
</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>
<span>'A President Gore would make us safer'.<br />
<br />If Al Gore runs he wins! No republican could beat him, not even McCain.<br />
