<div>Thus labeled, I am sure you can read that I am meandering about here in terms of my topic....so be it!<br />
<br />Condi is my choice for Pres candidate in 2008.....BOY is that obvious!<br />
<br />However, the problem we "early Condi supporters" face is, how to get her to R-U-N????<br />
<br />I am into the speculation part.....<br />
<br />Could it be that the plan is for her to surface LATER? You know, avoid the pitfalls of the Hillary, McCain, et al group of wannabees?<br />
<br />What if in 2007 she suddenly moves to VP vis-a-vis the departing and "living my life for now because of health problems" Cheney?<br />
<br />Just a supposition....but a potential anyway!<br />
