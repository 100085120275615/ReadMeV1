I'm not feeling it. Pebbled leather? It reminds me of Coach, circa 2002.<br /><br /><span>*</span> Check my post tomorrow, for my <span>fashion trend</span> prediction.

US Weekly reports, "Richie says she has had a crush on Goldblum since she was 13. The pair have plans to go out again." Cradle-robbing? Umm, a little bit.<br /><br /><br /><span>Feature</span><br /><span>Congressman Harold Ford Jr.'s Historic Senate Race</span><br /><br />The very photogenic <span>Congressman Harold Ford Jr.</span> (D-TN) first turned heads as the keynote speaker at the 2000 Democratic National Convention. Now, after winning Tennessee's Democratic primary with 80 percent of the vote, the charismatic 36-year-old congressman is running for his state's Senate seat, which Republican <span>Bill Frist</span> is vacating.<br /><br />If Ford beats the Republican's nominee this fall, he'll be the first black Senator from the Old South since the Reconstruction.<br /><br />A Friend of Bill (former <span>President Bill Clinton</span>), Ford hails from a powerful political dynasty. His father, <span>Congressman Harold Ford, Sr.</span>, was the first black congressman elected in the Old South since the Reconstruction. The Tennessee Fords have held office in Congress, the statehouse, and in city and county government for more than three decades.<br />(<a href="http://haroldfordjr2006.blogspot.com/">The Ford Report</a>, August 4, 2006)<br /><br /><span>Kudos To<br /></span>Society columnist <span>David Patrick Columbia</span> (of the must read New York Social Diary) who recently posted a snappy retort to Lloyd Grove's (Daily News) column, which skewered the social machinations of the ambitious <span>Melissa Berkelhammer</span>.<br /><br />Columbia says that society is and has always been a business. Paying a publicist to run favorable stories has been a tradition since before the <span>Rockefeller</span> family's PR campaign back in the 1920s when the family name had been badly tarnished by the scandalous actions of the family patriarch, <span>John D</span>.<br /><br />Columbia adds that strategic PR helped make <span>Brooke Astor</span> who she is (the grande dame of New York society, doncha know) and that there is nothing wrong with using publicity as<br /><br /><span>"</span><span>a tool for moving up in life, to improving one's stature, one's business and of course making useful connections which may provide a financial bonanza through business or marriage.</span><span>"</span><span> </span><br /><br />After all, who would fund the billion dollar philanthropic industry if not for the charitable balls and events chaired and attended by socialites?
