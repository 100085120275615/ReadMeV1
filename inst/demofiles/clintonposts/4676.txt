<p>Senator Clinton was caught out on Tuesday by an alert reporter for Newsday, Glenn Thrush, who captured the former first lady making a truly silly argument against school vouchers. "First family that comes and says 'I want to send my daughter to St. Peter's Roman Catholic School' and you say 'Great, wonderful school, here's your voucher,'" Mrs. Clinton said, according to the Long Island newspaper. "Next parent that comes and says, 'I want to send my child to the school of the Church of the White Supremacist ...' The parent says, 'The way that I read Genesis, Cain was marked, therefore I believe in white supremacy. ...You gave it to a Catholic parent, you gave it to a Jewish parent, under the Constitution, you can't discriminate against me.'" The senator added, "So what if the next parent comes and says, 'I want to send my child to the School of the Jihad?' ... I won't stand for it." </p>

<p>By this reasoning, Mrs. Clinton should oppose the First Amendment. Why allow religious freedom at all if people can start a jihadist mosque or a racist church? The country already has laws outlawing terrorist violence and violence motivated by racial hatred. Conspiracy laws may be invoked against those planning such crimes. That's the way we deal with racial and religious violent hatred in America, not by dispensing with free speech or freedom of religion to begin with.The argument can be made that the First Amendment is different from school vouchers because it involves private action rather than state funded action.The flaw in that argument is that it assumes the money belongs to the state rather than to the taxpayer from whom it was originally collected.</p>
