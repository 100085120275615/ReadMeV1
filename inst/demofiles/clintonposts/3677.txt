<div>Though she would like you to <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/nat1153.html">think she is</a>.  Does this sound familiar?  Bill Clinton was the <b>master</b> of co-opting conservative ideas and ideals and using them to his political advantage.  Hillary isn't stupid.  She saw a great politician (even if he was a bad president) and is trying to become him in the rebranding of herself.
<br />
<br />Hillary is not Bill.  She never will be.  As intelligent as Hillary is, she's a brainiac and not a charismatic.  Bill is.  W is.  Hillary isn't.  There is no about of rebranding that will change who Senator Clinton is.
<br />
<br />Ok, I've been stating the obvious.  What does this mean and how does it affect us Republicans?  Is this good or bad?
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com">Rush Limbaugh</a> was saying just yesterday that he thinks Hillary moving to the right is good for us because it will keep the leftist Republicans from moving too far left.  I can see the logic in that.
<br />
<br />I think it's a good thing on two levels.  First of all, I think it helps our agenda.  If she wants to think that she can make long term gains with short-term sacrifices, that's great.  Let her.  But people are wise to her and they remember her husband and how he was able to do it.
<br />
<br />Remember this and never, ever forget it.  Hillary Rodham was never and never will be Bill Clinton.</div>
