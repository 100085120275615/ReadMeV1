<br />As usual, I'm a few hours behind the news cycle on <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-sen-race-0808,0,6578875.story?coll=hc-headlines-home">this story</a>. <br />
<br />
<blockquote>With the nation watching, Connecticut Democrats thronged to the polls in unexpectedly high numbers Tuesday to reject Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman and endorse his anti-war challenger, Ned Lamont.<br />
<br />Unofficial results showed Lamont winning 52 percent of the vote, defeating a three-term incumbent who had come to be defined by his defense of the war in Iraq despite an advertising blitz begging voters to judge him on a progressive labor and environmental record.<br />
<br />Lieberman, 64, a vice presidential nominee in 2000 and a presidential hopeful only two years ago, conceded at 11:03 p.m. in a Hartford ballroom packed with national and international press, then defiantly announced he would press on as a petitioning candidate, forcing a three-way race in November.<br />
<br />"As I see it, in this campaign we just finished the first half and the Lamont team is ahead. But in the second half our team, Team Connecticut, is going to surge forward to victory in November," Lieberman said. Then he shouted, "Will you join me?"<br />
</blockquote>
<br />If I were voting in Connecticut, I'd vote for Joe hands down, and I honestly can't think of a single issue in which he and I are in agreement.  The fact is, despite his overly liberal politics, Lieberman is a class act.  He's the last Senator to engage in partisanship of partisanship's sake.  And, with regard to the war in Iraq, he's the <em>only </em>Democrat in the Senate who has acted like a statesman.  Unlike such luminaries as John Kerry and Hillary Clinton, Lieberman hasn't tried to distance himself from his own votes and his own remarks.  He has criticized the war policy on numerous occasions, but has not tried to morph himself into Cindy Sheehan just because public opinion has shifted on the matter.<br />
<br />By rejecting Lieberman, the Democrats have shown that they have sold out even more to the Barking Moonbat Patrol (consisting of the Moveon.org crowd).  At a time when the Republicans are continually demonstrating their inability to lead, the Democrats are becoming a party run by pot-smoking hippies and arrogant college professors.  How is that good for America?</div>
