The proof is easily demonstrated. When Hillary Clinton arose in righteous indignation to complain that Annâs treatment of the âfour witches of East Brunswickâ was âviciousâ, Anne was actually crude enough to remind Hillary that her own husband, Mr. Bill, was credibly accused of rape on multiple occasions. How dare she?<br /><br />The New York Times, being the ânewspaper of record,â would never stoop to that kind of nonsense. When, in 2003, they called The Da Vinci Code â<a href="http://www.danbrown.com/novels/davinci_code/nytimes.html">An exhilaratingly brainy thriller</a>â¦ a gleefully erudite suspense novelâ they were simply reporting the facts. When they insisted the novel was ââ¦one that is by no means sacrilegious, though it sharply challenges Vatican policyâ they were giving dispassionate analysis.<br /><br />You see, asserting that Jesus is not God or making the claim that the entire Christian faith is false is âby no means sacrilegious.â But pointing out that Bill Clinton almost certainly raped at least one woman and probably raped several - well, thatâs bomb-throwing. As far as any right-thinking person is concerned, Jesus is just another dead Jew, but Hillary Clinton is an untouchably sacred cow.<br /></span>
