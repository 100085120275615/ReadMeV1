However, now that I have internet access, I'll add my two cents into Lamont's Primary victory.<br />
<br />Since the beginning of this summer, the Lieberman campaign knew that they were facing a tougher battle than they could have ever expected this time last year. As Primary Day approached, it was clear that the momentum was with Lamont. On Thursday night before the Primary, poll numbers came into the Lieberman headquarters indicating a 14% deficit against Lamont. I had all expectations that Lieberman could not win the primary - there simply wasn't enough time, organization, or momentum with the campaign at that point. My expectations rang true on Primary Day when Senator Lieberman officially lost to Lamont 52% to 48%. I was actually surprised that Lieberman had been able to close the gap so much in so little time.<br />
<br />Immediately, prominent Democrats including Senators Dodd, Kerry, Clinton, and Reid all endorsed Ned Lamont. Such endorsements are a blow to Lieberman who had previously relied on their pre-primary endorsements. Lieberman, however, remains defiant. He now intends to create his own party "Team Connnecticut" and run in the election in November as an independent. Polling has shown that in a Lamont-Lieberman-Schlesinger (the Republican, who no one knows/cares about) race, Lieberman leads Lamont 51-27-9 percent. A weak Republican candidate would certainly bode well for the Lieberman campaign, as he polls better with Republicans than Democrats. The race could still be competitive, unless calls for rallying around the "official Democratic candidate" (Lamont) prove to be stronger.<br />
<br />At this point, I think that it is best that Connecticut Democrats rally behind Lamont. His stances have be consistent with the party and the feel of the state. Though, after working for Lieberman, his loss is somewhat lamentable on a personal level, ideologically speaking, Lamont's victory is a victory for progressive Democrats such as myself. In a state in which Bush holds a 70% disaproval rating, Lamont's anti-war stance and other liberal attitudes make his election in November seem pretty much secured.<br />
