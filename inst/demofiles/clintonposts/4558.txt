<p>I received this interesting piece as an email.Â  It certainly makes one think&#8230;</p>
<p><font size="2">You really should be sitting down when you read this one.</font><font size="2">Gold Star Mothers is an organization made up of women whose sons were killed in military combat during service in the United States armed forces. Â Recently a delegation of New York State Gold Star Mothers made a trip to Washington, DC, to discuss various concerns with their elected representatives.Â Â According to published reports, there was only one politician who refused to meet with these ladies.Â Â Can you guess which politician that might be?</font><font size="2">Was it New York Senator Charles Schumer? Nope, he met with them.Â Â Try again.Â Â Do you know anyone serving in the Senate who has never showed anything but contempt for our military?Â Â Do you happen to know the name of any politician in Washington who&#8217;s husband once wrote of his loathing for the military? Now you&#8217;re getting warm! You got it!</font><font size="2">None other than the Queen herself, Hillary Rotten Clinton. She refused repeated requests to meet with the Gold Star Mothers.Â Â Now, please don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re surprised. This woman wants to be President of the United States &#8212; and there is a huge percentage of Voters who are eager to help her achieve that goal.</p>
<p>May you sleep in peace always&#8230;and please&#8230;.hug or thank a Veteran for that privilege.Â  Think about this one !!!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget, our girl, Hillary Rodham Clinton, as a New York Senator, now comes under this fancy congressional Retirement and Staffing Plan.Â Â It&#8217;s common knowledge that, in order for her to establish NYS residency, they purchased a million+ dollar house in upscale Chappaqua, NY.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>Now, they are entitled to Secret Service protection for life.Â Â Still makes sense.Â Â Here is where it becomes interesting. The mortgage payments hover at about $10,000 per month. BUT, an extra residency had to be built within the acreage in order to house the Secret Service agents..</p>
<p>The Clinton&#8217;s now charge the Secret Service $10,000 monthly rent for the use of said Secret Service residence and that rent is just about equal to their mortgage payment, &#8230;&#8230;meaning that we, the tax payers, are paying the Clinton&#8217;s mortgage, their transportation, their safety and security, their 12 man staff, and it&#8217;s all perfectly legal.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Cdr. Hamilton McWhorter USN (ret)</p>
