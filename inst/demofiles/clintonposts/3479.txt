<div>Perhaps the only reason that I've stayed a Republican this long is because I always figured they would defend the country and especially national sovreignty.  No longer.  The democrats gave up any pretenses about being serious on national security about 1972.  Carter's weakness and ineptitude, Mondale's nuclear freeze, Dukakis riding in the tank, Clinton's military social engineering, to Kerry's well, here the list is so long...but in every case, you could expect the democrats to sacrifice national security interests for the expense of a few polling points.<br />
<br />Never was that the case with the Republicans.  Goldwater "spoke truth to power" and was right about Vietnam.  Nixon actually sent the bombers to the North and brought the comunists to the table.  Remember, they asked for the peace talks so we'd stop the bombing.  Reagan defied all the polls and put missiles in West Germany and tried to put them in space.  While the left called it Star Wars, the Soviets called it quits.<br />
<br />I expected the Republicans to be the party of respect for our laws, our borders, and our national identity.  I expect the democrats to risk our safety and sovreignty for a few votes.  I mean, they never took the communists seriously, they don't take global terrorism seriously, do I really expect them to see the border invasion as anything but an "opportunity".<br />
<br />With the passage of bills in the senate that guarantee social security benefits to illegals, the republicans are now no longer the party of national sovreignty.  Yes, there was a difference in patriotism between democrats and republicans.  Yes, republicans saw America as the shining city on a hill, while democrats who viewed America favorably saw it more as just another nation, and those who viewed it as evil found a place at the demcoratic table.<br />
<br />Now, republicans are equally as willing to sell our sovreignty for a few votes.  They are even willing to buy those votes with federal largesse.  They say it isn't amnesty, but it is.  You break the law and get:  citizenship and federal beneifts.  You abide by the law and get: nothing.<br />
<br />I believe I will make a movie called "The Soul Stealer" which will take place in Washingtoc DC.  It will have a cast of hundreds, who travel to the nation's captial, and within a few years, their soul is gone.  They look and talk the same, and on all outward appearances, they appear to be unchanged.  That is untill they vote on legislation.<br />
<br />In the lead will be the Senator from Arizona, his supporting actor will be a drunk from Massachusettes.<br />
<br />And like every other cheap horror movie, this one will have numerous sequels, with the same plot, and same outcome.  Oh sure, the names will change, but the carnage will be the same.<br />
<br />The only thing that can keep me from voting for not-republican in November is the demcorats are, if you can believe it, far worse.  How did we get this government?  How did we get those two parties?<br />
<br />Sure, I make no attempts to hide my opposition to things like abortion, gay marriage, and the other social issues that the left has tried to force down my throat.  Perhaps that is why I feel strongly, as liek most people, I frankly don't see them as serious national issues.  If Frank and Steve marry or not, hell, my life's not going to be one iota different.  But force me to, and I will fight.  And I guess I'm guilty, as I let those issues sometimes cloud my votes.  But, it wasn't as if the republicans fired the first shot.  The assault on the American culture began on the left.<br />
<br />But I've had it with the republican party.  The democrats make no attempt to hide their crass pandering, their disdain for the family, their contempt for American miltitary and world power.  But the republicans?  That wasn't the republican party.  Reagan didn't pander, he lead.  He knew America's strength was in family and faith.  And he knew America must wield her power to protect and defend freedom.<br />
<br />And he would have never supported giving away American national sovreignty.<br />
<br />I've had it with them.  If I'm wrong, then convince me otherwise.  Else, I will re-register as decline to state.<br />
<br />And like the Gipper, will know that I didn't leave the party, the party left me.</div>
