<div>As the essayist Roger Rosenblatt says, there is a lot of "noise" out there among the political pundits, especially in regards to the upcoming 2006 congressional elections and the 2008 presidential election. Who should we listen to among the chattering classes? Who has got it right?<br />    The one who seems to be consistently dead-on as far as prognostic political punditry is Newsweek columnist Jonathen Alter. While the other pundits seem to go along with the "conventional wisdom" that Senator Hillary Clinton, with all her money and name recognition, is a shoe-in for the 2008 Democratic nomination, or that the nomination is hers to lose, Alter takes the opposite approach.<br />    According to the Newsweek columnist, by the time the 2008 nomination process is here, Senator Clinton won't even be a player. He believes that an "anti-Hillary" candidate will emerge and that the Party will turn to that candidate because it wants to win, needs to win. And that candidate will be a centrist, moderate, not another Northeast liberal. The junior Senator from New York negative's are already high and she is not even a declared candidate.<br />    Wisely, Jonathen Alter has not yet predicted who that candidate will be. It is higly likely,howerer, that before most of the other pundits, a future column by Mr. Alter will read, "The Democrats can win in 2008 with Senator Evan Bayh".</div>
