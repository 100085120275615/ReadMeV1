<div>In yet another example of "Bush for a Strong Democracy", the Bush administration, through the FBI, is illegally conducting surveillance on dissident groups.<br />
<br />This follows a pattern of behavior. You may remember the FBI's actions in regards to greenpeace and the ACLU. Of course, most of these documents are heavily redacted. The purpose, of course, for redacting these documents is "National Security"<br />
<br />In this case, is a Vegan who protests meat eating. I am sure that this is what we need for national security. We need an FBI who is concerned with what supermarkets are selling, what people are eating, and what some young woman is concerned about.<br />
<br />Now, as an avid meat eater myself, I do not agree with this young lady's assertion - that no one should ever eat meat.<br />
<br />But I think we all have cause for concern. Really, DOES THE FBI need to have arrested this woman for noticing that her group had been infiltrated by the FBI, and took action to make the government accountable for such an obvious example of attempting to block free expression?<br />
<br />What she did was write down the license plate on his unmarked car. For it she was arrested and jailed. Had she memorized the number, would she still have been jailed? <br />
<br />The fact of the matter is that the FBI shouldn't be concerned with this. This woman has a PERFECTLY GOOD RIGHT to protest this market for selling meat. Furthermore, the FBI has no right to arrest her for uncovering an illegal action by the FBI or to seek  more information about that situation. She was doing nothing illegal.<br />
<br />Now all you conservatives out there might well try and defend the FBI. Let me ask you this. This might be all well and good that the president wants to find out more about these groups, infiltrate this group, and at an extreme, create infighting in these groups like in the days of J. Edgar Hoover. But, will you feel the same way when Hillary is in office?<br />
<br />Conservatives and Progressives alike need to stand up agaist this obvious and illegal action. America is based on free speech. But the power that the administrtation is taking is FAR to great, and fundamentally against the wishes of, and dreams of the framers of the constitution.<br />
<br />When coupled with no warrant spying on Americans, when coupled with unlimited detentions of American Citizens, when coupled with abuse and torture of detainees, then the whole picture starts to look a bit spooky. <br />
<br />Is this the America that we want?</div>
