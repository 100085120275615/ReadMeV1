<p>Ken Mehlman is <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060206/ap_on_el_pr/gop_clinton_4">floating trial balloons</a> against Hillary Clinton:</p>

<blockquote>Democratic Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, a potential presidential contender in 2008, "seems to have a lot of anger" and voters usually do not send angry candidates to the White House, the Republican Party chairman said Sunday.

<p>"When you think of the level of anger, I'm not sure it's what Americans want," said Ken Mehlman, head of the<br />
Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>Mehlman cited the New York senator's remarks on Martin Luther King Day in which she called the Bush administration "one of the worst" in history and compared the Republican-controlled House to a plantation where opposing voices are silenced.</p>

<p>"I don't think the American people, if you look historically, elect angry candidates. And whether it's the comments about the plantation or the worst administration in history, Hillary Clinton seems to have a lot of anger," Mehlman told ABC's "This Week."</blockquote></p>

<p>So <strong><em>that's</em></strong> why she keeps getting elected with overwhelming margins.  Huh.</p>
