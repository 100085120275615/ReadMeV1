</a> This is an example of one of the checks Peter Paul used to pay for the Gala concert hard money fund raising component of the Gala Tribute. It was deposited in a special account opened by Black Ink shown above.  It is signed by Paul from an account of one of his personal holding companies. It refers to "For Stan Lee's Hosting", clearly not paid by Stan Lee Media as reported by Hillary's campaign.<br />
<br />Hillary saw this check, and others like it, in early July, 2001, when it was hand delivered to her Senate chambers with Paul's demand letter to report his contributions to the FEC on July 16, 2001, it was also attached to Paul's civil complaint against her as a defendant, filed June 18, 2001 and it was attached to an FEC complaint against her filed on July 16, 2001 and hand delivered to her senate offices that day. Nonetheless, she ignored it, and the other checks and invoices attached when she aided and abetted a third false FEC report to be filed by her Senate campaign Treasurer, Andrew Grossman, on July 30, 2001.</div>
