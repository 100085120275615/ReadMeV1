This morning's Courant has an <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/local/hc-ctsenate0824.artaug24,0,6788295.story?page=1&coll=hc-headlines-local">article</a> with the latest on the Senate Race.  Here are the highlights.<br /><br /><ul><br /><li>Lieberman's name will appear 5th on the ballot after Schlesinger, Lamont, Timothy A. Knibbs of the Concerned Citizens Party, and Ralph A. Ferrucci of the Green Party.</li><br /><br /><li>Ned Lamont has been endorsed by the UAW.</li><br /><br /><li>Hillary Clinton has invited Lamont to meet with her on Friday to discuss his campaign and how she can help him win.  He will also be attending an event sponsored by Moveon.org in NYC.</li><br /><br /><li>Lieberman will appear tomorrow with Rob Simmons and Jodi Rell to mark the one year anniversary of the Pentagon's reversal of the decision to close the sub base at Groton.</li><br /></ul><br /><br />I wonder how being so far down on the ballot will affect Lieberman's final numbers.  At the same time I'm curious if being first might help Alan Schlesinger.<br /><br /><i>Source</i><br />Pazniokas, Mark.
