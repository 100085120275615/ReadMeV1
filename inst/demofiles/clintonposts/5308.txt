From the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/16/AR2005111601022.html?sub=AR">Washington Post</a>:<br /><blockquote>"Saddam is gone. It's a good thing, but I don't agree with what was done," [Bill] Clinton told students at a forum at the American University of Dubai.<br /><br />"It was a big mistake. The American government made several errors ... one of which is how easy it would be to get rid of Saddam and how hard it would be to unite the country."<br /><br />...<br /><br />"The mistake that they made is that when they kicked out Saddam, they decided to dismantle the whole authority structure of Iraq. ... We never sent enough troops and didn't have enough troops to control or seal the borders," Clinton said.</blockquote><br /><br />This is the exact same thing Hillary Clinton has been saying since her (in my view mistaken) vote authorizing Bush to do whatever he wanted to Iraq.  On Larry King Live, she <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/21/iraq.hillary/">said</a>:<br /><blockquote>"How could they have been so poorly prepared for the aftermath of the toppling of Saddam Hussein?  I don't understand how they had such an unrealistic view of what was going to happen."<br /><br />...<br /><br />"Obviously, I've thought about that a lot in the months since," she said. "No, I don't regret giving the president authority because at the time it was in the context of weapons of mass destruction, grave threats to the United States, and clearly, Saddam Hussein had been a real problem for the international community for more than a decade."<br /></blockquote><br />The mistake made by Democrats who voted to authorize Bush to do whatever he wanted to Iraq, was gravely overestimating his competence.
