<div><p>Marty Peretz, the long-time <em>eminence grise</em> of <a href="http://www.tnr.com">The New Republic</a>, makes a <a href="http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=w060619&amp;s=peretz062206">very personal and impassioned case</a> for the Presidential candidacy of former Vice President Al Gore in 2008. It is personal because Peretz and Gore have known each other since Gore was an undergraduate at Harvard four decades ago. It is impassioned because Peretz sees few workable options for the 2008 Democratic nomination. Hillary Clinton is too unpopular, in his view, with too large a proportion of the electorate - and none of the rest of the presumed candidates have the stature or excitement that would lead to a Democratic victory.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, wishing in this case is not likely to make Gore a candidate - much less President. Gore is not taking the steps that anyone who would want to capture the nomination needs to at this point. No organization in Iowa or New Hampshire - no organized fund raising. It seems to this observer that Al Gore aspires to moral rather than political leadership at this point. There have been few - if any - moral leaders of any stature in this country in the years since the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Perhaps Al Gore seeks to fill that void - a worthy ambition indeed.</p></div>
