<div><p>Would a Lamont victory in CT be a <em>bad</em> thing for Hillary?  Ben (the plagiarist guy?) over at Red State <a href="http://redstate.com/stories/the_parties/democrats/the_coming_swarm">thinks so</a>.  And really, this may have some legs given WJC's campaigning for Lieberman.  (Say what you will about Clinton, but he's light on his feet and has <em>forgotten</em> more about running an effective campaign than the current congressional Democrats ever knew.)</p>

<p>One thing about it, I don't think that Hillary's internals are one damn bit good among the nutroots.  So really how Lieberman fares tomorrow could reflect how Hillary might perform with the moonbats later on when the rubber has to start hitting the road.  Or it may reflect nothing.  I'm not sure, but it's definitely an interesting hypothesis.  [Psst!  It'll never effect her ability to raise money, which she can do with or without the puke funnels of the left wing blogs.]</p>

<p>Methinks that even if Lamont wins, the nutters will be mighty disappointed in him if they think he's going to trundle all of their same shouty, screachy talking points back to D.C. next year.  Despite how unpopular the Iraq war is becoming, and oftentimes rightly so, I think that the full-on nutter act would be political suicide, and Lamont knows it.  The pap he's recycling for the likes of the blogger groupies* orbiting his campaign will probably not be the same pap he lays out on the Senate floor.</p>

<p>Am I saying that Lamont may not uphold his nutter principles?  Yes.  Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</p>

<p>Anywho, where was I?  Oh, yes: Hillary.</p>

<p>Hey, this wouldn't necessarily be the first time Democrats have shat in the mess kits of Bill and Hill.  But she may well be one of the few electable candidates that they can field, and that's a bit of a stretch.  So don't be surprised if the nutters help torpedo someone they could actually help elect.  In fact, count on the nutters doing that <em>very thing</em> to the best of their ability.</p>
