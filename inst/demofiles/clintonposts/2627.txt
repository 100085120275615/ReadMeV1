<p>This ... is why I am running for the U.S. House of Representatives from Colorado's 7th Congressional District:</p>

<p>My great abiding love for this country comes from the deep reverence I have for the Constitution ... and for the principles upon which our nation was founded that are articulated in the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<p>Bush and Cheney have repeatedly subverted the ideals to which this republic has traditionally aspired. Bush/Cheney have cynically manipulated the mass murder and great tragedy of September 11, 2001, to grab undue power for the executive branch, to violate the trust the American have usually placed in the White House on matters of national security.</p>

<p>The Bush regime's lies to start the Iraq war are certainly the most costly of these transgressions against the principles of the republic. It was Bush who ordered the unprovoked attack, invasion and occupation of Iraq because, he claimed, Saddam possessed weapons of mass destruction. But always remember, the best intelligence we had at the time, from official agents on the ground in Iraq, the UN weapons inspectors, was that there were not any WMD stockpiles or WMD programs.</p>

<p>Always remember that the Downing Street memos reveal that <a href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/bush/memo.htm">Bush plotted</a> with Tony Blair to try and goad Hussein into some kind of strike against the UN inspectors to justify retaliation ... something that would not have had to be discussed if Bush hadn't already known that there weren't any WMD in Iraq in March 2003. In other words, Bush lied and lied blatantly to us and the world about the reasons for this war.</p>

<p>We found out earlier this year that Bush/Cheney have also subverted the Bill of Rights and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by authorizing warrantless spying on American citizens.</p>

<p>Those who are patriots and love their country, support the unique characteristics of governance in the United States of America, must especially guard against the subversion from unscrupulous and unethical leaders. </p>

<p>Consequently, the reasons to launch an official impeachment inquiry in the U.S. House of Representatives against George W. Bush and Dick "Chickenhawk" Cheney got even more backing yesterday when a federal district court judge ruled that <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/08/18/WIRETAP.TMP">Bush broke the law</a> when he approved warrantless wiretapping of U.S. citizens.</p>

<p>Bush, himself, clearly does not understand the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law. Today he was asked to respond to yesterday's ruling and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060818-1.html">he said</a> that: "I would say that those who herald this decision simply do not understand the nature of the world in which we live. ..." (and then he launched into his usual, predictable fear and terror justifications). He is so wrong. It is precisely because we do understand the nature of the world in which we live that upholding the Constitution during stressful times is so important and essential to the preservation of liberty. It is because we understand that our nation's enemies wish to deprive of us of the promise of the American Revolution that we cannot allow a leader like Bush to use fear to rationalize undercutting freedom and our civil rights.</p>

<p>This is very basic Americana ... we are a nation of laws, everyone has to obey the laws, presidents are not above the laws. Whether Bush and Cheney and Gonzales like the FISA law or not -- they took an oath to uphold the Constitution and follow our country's laws. When presidents, vice presidents and attorneys general break the law -- impeachment of those officials is in order. To not demand justice from lawbreakers is to foster chaos and tyranny. It is that simple.</p>

<p>The legislative branch of our system is to hold to account the other two branches through its oversight function. The radical Republicans controlling the Senate and House have failed miserably to fullfil their Constitutional duty -- for the purely partisan reason that Bush is a radical Republican like them. It is time for that to change -- Senators should join Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold's censure resolution; House members should support the beginnings of an impeachment investigation.</p>

<p>The Congress does not have to wait for a decision from the Supreme Court on the appeal of this case. There is ample evidence that Bush has broken the law and failed to defend the Fourth Amendment. Now is the time to begin action to restore honor and integrity to the executive branch of the federal government.</p>

<p>The Senate should censure Bush/Cheney ... the House should impeach Bush/Cheney. Patriots should demand these actions from our elected representatives.</p>

<p>The protection of what makes America, America, will be my code if I am elected to the Congress from the 7th CD. I won't be a cautious insider like the Democrat candidate for this office or a rubber stamp for Bush/Cheney like the Republican.</p>

<p>In the House I will support instigating an impeachment inquiry of Bush and Cheney. I will support upholding the Fourth Amendment and all other laws -- by everyone in this country -- no exceptions. </p>

<p>Principle Before Politics!</p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/capitalgames?pid=113132"><p>In ruling on Thursday that the Bush administration's warrantless surveillance program is unconstitutional and must be halted, U.S. district Judge Anna Diggs Taylor slammed the White House on several critical fronts.

<p>For months, George W. Bush, Dick Cheney and other administration aides have been defending--even championing--what they call the "terrorist surveillance program," under which the National Security Agency can intercept communications that involve an American citizen or resident without a warrant if one party to the communication is overseas and suspected of being linked to anti-American terrorists). They have maintained that the president has the authority as commander in chief to authorize such surveillance. Though the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) generally forbids wiretapping without warrants, the White House has contended that Bush is not bound by the limitations of that law. This claim--arising from the Bush administration's view of expansive (even supreme) presidential power--set up a constitutional clash. And in the first round of the legal battle, Judge Taylor has knocked out the White House argument. ...</p>

<p>... The judge reserved her sharpest words for slicing and dicing the administration's contention that Bush had the authority to ignore FISA and, in essence, act outside (or above) that law. And she cited a favorite Supreme Court case of conservatives to make this point: Clinton v. Jones. In that case, the justices ruled that Clinton could be sued for sexual harassment by Paula Jones. Taylor wrote:<blockquote><em>It was never the intent of the Framers to give the President such unfettered control, particularly where his actions blatantly disregard the parameters clearly enumerated in the Bill of Rights. The three separate branches of government were developed as a check and balance for one another. It is within the court's duty to ensure that power is never "condense[d]...into a single branch of government."</em> Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, <em>542 U.S. 507, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion). We must always be mindful that "[w]hen the President takes official action, the Court has the authority to determine whether he has acted within the law."</em> Clinton v. Jones, <em>520 U.S. 681, 703 (1997). "It remains one of the most vital functions of this Court to police with care the separation of the governing powers....When structure fails, liberty is always in peril."</em> Public Citizen v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, <em>491 U.S. 440, 468 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring).</em></blockquote>... Once again, a court has told Bush that he is not all-powerful. He cannot create military tribunals on his own. He cannot detain American citizens as enemy combatants without affording them some elements of due process. Taylor's decision will probably be appealed by the Bush administration, and the case will wind its way toward the Supreme Court. But this decision reaffirms--and puts into practice--the bedrock principle that a president's power does not trump the workings of a republican government, even when it comes to war. Weeks before he took office in 2001, Bush quipped, "If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier, just so long as I'm the dictator." Democracy, though, is not easy. And a commander in chief has to abide by the rules, as various courts have now ruled. The administration's King George approach to governance has taken another blow. But it's royally unlikely this president is going to accept the decision and give up his claim to the throne.</p></blockquote></p>

<blockquote cite="http://www.crooksandliars.com/posts/2006/08/17/cafferty-on-the-nsa-ruling-bush-is-breaking-the-law/"><p>Jack Cafferty ripped into the Republican leadership today over the recent ruling that the NSA warrantless program is illegal.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><img alt="TSR-Cafferty-NSA_Ruling.jpg" height="156" id="image967188" src="http://static.crooksandliars.com/2006/08/TSR-Cafferty-NSA_Ruling.jpg" width="225" />

<p>Transcript:<blockquote>Cafferty: You know Wolf, it seems like were having this discussion about this judgeâs ruling sort of in the abstract, as if thereâs no precedent for what the judge decided. The judge in effect upheld the ruling of the FISA court which says that âif you want to wiretap phones you need a warrant to do soâ. The court was created by Congress in 1978 I think it was and the law of the land says, "Get a warrant". The actions of the administration have ignored the law of the land in that regard. So itâs not a discussion in the abstract. Itâs not hypothetical. There are laws on the books against what the administration is doing and itâs about time someone said it out loud.</p>

<p>This Federal district judge ruled today President Bush is breaking the law by spying on people, in this country, without a warrant. The judge said the President is violating the First Amendment to the Constitution. The Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act FISA, passed by Congress 1978, specifically to prevent this kind of abuse of power. It was being done before. Thatâs why the FISA court was created in the first place.</p>

<p>So what does this mean? It means President Bush violated his oath of office, among other things, when he swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. It means heâs been lying to us about the program since it started, when he tells us thereâs nothing illegal about what heâs doing. A court has ruled it is illegal. And it means a 75 year old black female judge in Michigan has finally stepped in and done the job that Congress is supposed to do, namely oversight of the executive branch of government. But the govâ¦but the Congress is controlled by Republicans. They are controlled by the President, and they have done nothing in the way of oversight.</blockquote></p></div>
