<div>Some times  I just scratch my head at the things the media chooses to jump on with regard to Hillary.  Last week Hillary criticized an extreme anti-immigration bill working its way through Congress by invoking Jesus.  Of course, the media has completely internalized the Republican talking point that Democrats are secular so any mention of God, Jesus, religion or the bible by a Democrat is immediately questioned.  So, the media pretty much does the bidding of the Republican party.  <br />
<br />Anyway, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/03/26/tancredo-clinton/">ThinkProgress</a>  puts them back in their place. The media and GOP should be very, very careful.  Hillary Clinton is nothing if not smart.  You better believe that when she says something there is a logic and reason behind.
