<br />Plan B is going to be out there, thanks to von Eschenbach and Bush, not to mention Hillary. Why is this all hitting the fan right now? Because Hillary Clinton and some other key Dems in the Senate threatened to hold up von Eschenbach's nomination as FDA commish unless the process to make Plan B available OTC was moved forward. And here we are!<br />
