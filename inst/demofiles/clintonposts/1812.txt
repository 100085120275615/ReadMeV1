<br />Molly Ivins has a great piece on the Democratic leadership black hole, in her usual inimitable style. Gotta love it.<br />
<br />Molly Ivins <br />01.20.06 <br />
<br />
<blockquote>Not. Backing. Hillary.<br />Equivocation in Democratic party has gone on far too long -- time for real leadership<br />
<br /> <br />AUSTIN, Texas â I'd like to make it clear to the people who run the Democratic Party that I will not support Hillary Clinton for president. <br />Enough. Enough triangulation, calculation and equivocation. Enough clever straddling, enough not offending anyone. This is not a Dick Morris election. Sen. Clinton is apparently incapable of taking a clear stand on the war in Iraq, and that alone is enough to disqualify her. Her failure to speak out on Terri Schiavo, not to mention that gross pandering on flag-burning, are just contemptible little dodges. </blockquote>

<br />And here's what <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/the-chinks-in-the-hillar_b_14330.html">Arianna</a> has to say, calling Molly's piece a "bodyslam" to Hillary. Heh. Hillary in '08? NFW, or so they say.</div>
