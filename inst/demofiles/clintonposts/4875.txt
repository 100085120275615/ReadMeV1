<p>Well, that&#8217;s the question we&#8217;d get if it were a Republican. Hillary Clinton is <strong><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/22/AR2006082201161.html?referrer=email&#038;referrer=email&#038;referrer=email">opposed to the renewal </a></strong>of the Ryan White Act in its present form.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is holding up renewal of the primary federal law that battles HIV/AIDS, the 1990 Ryan White Act, causing a rift among activists on the subject and threatening approval of the legislation this year.  Clinton (D-N.Y.) said she opposes the measure because it would lower funding for her home state. But some AIDS groups also see broader political motives at work. Other states that would lose out include California, Florida and Illinois &#8212; all places Clinton would need to win if she seeks the presidency. Her critics also note that many of the states that would receive higher funding under the new formula are rural and Southern, which tend to vote Republican.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s great. Even the Washington Post thinks that Hillary Clinton is playing politics with AIDS. How utterly contemptible.
