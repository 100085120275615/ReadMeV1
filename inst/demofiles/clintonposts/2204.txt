<em>I wrote this for a local weekly newspaper I freelance for and thought with our President wandering around the country trying to change something that's worked for a long time, you may want to read this report...whatcha think?</em>
<br />
<br />Delaware Valley Collegeâs Student Center in Doylestown, Pennsylvania was the setting for A Citizenâs Forum: Social Security or Insecurity. Sponsored by the Doylestown Democrats, the forum held a presentation by Terri Ivers, AARP Team Leader, 8th Congressional District. A panel discussion was planned afterwards with Nancy Keenan, Patrick Murphy and Dr. Charles Pennacchio.<br />
<br />The large room was filled by the time the event started and approximately 200 people of various ages were in attendance. Neil Samuels, Chairman of Doylestown Democrats and Deputy Chairman of the Bucks County Democratic Party welcomed the crowd.<br />
<br />Questioned prior to the event, Samuels was adamant about how important an issue this is for all Americans.<br />
<br />"We planned this event prior to the State of the Union Address and of course had no idea what President Bush was going to speak about, but we thought it an important enough subject to give people the chance to take some control and let their voices be heard. We hope they have contacted their neighbors, their legislators and they news media on their concerns." Said Samuels.<br />
<br />It was curious that most of the attendees were over the Presidentâs cut-off age of 55 for the Social Security changes to affect them. Samuels concluded that they were likely concerned about their family members who may be affected by any drastic changes in the fund.<br />"This is a monumentally important debate about the most successful social program this country has ever had." Samuels said.<br />
<br />Terri Ivers began her presentation with a vengeance.<br />
<br />"It is important to know that what youâve been told about Social Security going broke is false and untrue. A system that constantly takes money in cannot go broke. How could that happen? It may have some downfalls, but itâs not going broke," She said. "We put 6.7% of our paychecks into the fund every month and that amount is doubled by your employer. It is not true that Social Security is going to go run out of money."<br />
<br />Ivers explained that in the past more money goes into Social Security than is distributed out and in 2005, $91 billion will be coming into the fund which is more than the fund pays out for the year.<br />
<br />"The fund has always paid out on time and the amount due. The Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan group has explained that there may be a problem in 2052. Yes, 2052. Unlike the Presidentâs estimate of 2042." Ivers explained. "The Social Security Trust Fund will be able to pay everyone their full entitlement up to 2052. After that it will be dropped to 73%. I know nobody wants to hear that there would be a drop, but unlike what weâve been told, the fund will not go broke."<br />
<br />Ivers explained that the AARPâs position on this issue is not a disapproval of adjustments to the fund, but they do disagree with radical surgery. She clarified the finer points the AARP suggests legislators consider before making any major changes to the plan.<br />
<br />"First, raise the salary level cap thatâs taxed by Social Security from $90,000 to $140,000. What you have heard through the chain letter in emails that Congress doesnât have to pay into the fund is untrue. Congress has had to pay since 1983 when it was passed that all federal employees have to pay into Social Security." Ivers said.<br />
<br />"We do think that the seven million state and local employees that donât pay into the fund should. The AARP feels all workers should receive the benefits and the protections of the fund." She said.<br />
<br />"If our President and other elected officials are so anxious to invest in the stock market why donât they take portion of the fund and invest in securities that are safe from political influence? If you can do that, then do it for the entire fund, not through individual funds." Ivers said. "The current administration says thereâs not enough money so they want to take away from it. Does this make sense? Taking money away to make it better?"<br />
<br />"The administration wants to take one third of Social Security into private investments. The loss is estimated to be $2 trillion. Yes, not billion, but two trillion dollars! They tell us there wonât be a reduction and there would be money from the general fund. Do you know what the general fund is? Itâs your taxes. The president wonât raise our taxes, but how will he fund such a loss? That means to raise the deficit. In 2005 our deficit is expected to be $427 billion." Said Ivers.<br />Ivers told the audience that 82 of the largest corporations in America have paid no taxes in the first two years of President Bushâs first term. Revenue of taxes has been raised on employeeâs work. She also explained that if this administration is successful in convincing people that Social Security is in crisis, the fund will lose support and changes will be easy to make.<br />
<br />"The first person to receive a Social Security check was a woman by the name of Ida Fuller. According to Representative Bill Thomas (R-CA) the fund should be readjusted by race and gender. In his mind, women should get more because they live longer. This fund was never intended to be the full retirement benefit, but itâs always been a security net. 47 million depend on Social Security. For two thirds of these people, itâs the largest part of their income. For the poorest seven million itâs their only income and if taken away 48% would fall below the poverty level." Said Ivers.<br />
<br />Patrick Murphy, a former constitutional law professor at West Point and veteran of the war in Iraq was on hand for the panel discussion and had a few comments.<br />
<br />"Security is means a lot to me. I fought for our security in Baghdad and now our most precious security is under attack. This is protection for our elderly and itâs about ideology. I just had lunch with Senator Hillary Clinton this week when she was visiting Philadelphia and she is in agreement with us here. She told me that itâs shameful that we have to fight for this and shameful that our president is doing this to our country." Murphy said.<br />
<br />"Nothing conservative about borrowing two trillion dollars from what our parents hold as their security. Itâs a matter of ideology not privatization, but hoodwinking the American people. 20% of our generation X have not saved one dime towards their retirement, but they are suddenly supposed to be [financially] savvy?" said Murphy.<br />
<br />Nancy Keenan from Perkasie, a writer specializing in issues affecting those over age 50 and over has much experience in this area. She has written extensively on Social Security and Medicare issues and was honored by Governor Ridge in 1999 by being awarded the Silver and Gold Award for Promoting the Dignity of Older Pennsylvanians. Currently Keenan serves as chair on the of the Bucks County Area Agency on Aging Advisory Board and has been a member of the Perkasie Borough Council for the past 13 years.<br />
<br />"While listening to all the news media and our elected officials speak of this Social Security issue, I havenât heard one word about the folks who arenât retirees like the widows and children who depend on the fund after the breadwinner dies. Nobody has mentioned anything about those who are on disability through illness or circumstance." She said. "And women are expected to live out their lives as widows. Their life expectancy is 79.4 years as opposed to a manâs 73.9 years."<br />
<br />"More than 40% of older Americans are kept out of poverty because of Social Security. Women, if they have worked outside the home have earned less than men and have also taken time off or at least cut back on hours worked due to childbirth, child rearing or care-giving of older relatives or their husbands. Their benefits are less than a mans and it particularly impacts those who have never married or have divorced and will not inherit a husbandâs larger benefit payment." She said.<br />
<br />Some of Keenanâs statistics are profound:<br />
<ul>
<li>
<br />Of white women age 65 and older, 11.1 percent live at or below the poverty level.<br />
</li>
<li>
<br />Of minority women it is 30.2 percent of African-American women and 25.3 percent for Hispanic American women. Poverty increases with age.</li>
<li>
<br />Presently of 35 million Americans, one in eight are age 65 or older and three of five are women.<br />Over the next 40 years, people age 65 and older will more than double with persons age 85 and over will more than triple.</li>
<li>
<br />By 2040 for every man 65 or older there will be 127 women.</li>
<li>
<br />For every 100 men 85 and older there will be 168 women.</li>
<li>
<br />The average income for an older woman is $15,615 compared to $29,171 for an older man. </li>
</ul>
<p>
<br />"The Older Womanâs League maintains that neither privatization of Social Security nor private accounts will work for women. They caution that it doesnât provide a safety net for women who are divorced, widowed, survivors with young children or have disabilities. Privatization does not provide an inflation-adjusted guarantee, as does Social Security. Risks are increased and stock market growth is stated in averages not guarantees. If the timing is wrong, you lose in that crapshoot." Said Keenan. </p>
<p>
<br />Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, Dr. Charles Pennachio explained that although this was to be a one-issue forum, it would be unwise to lose sight of the whole picture.</p>
<p>
<br />"This is a crisis driven administration. If they can convince the American public of the worst case scenario they have an easier win in making changes. This is a social safety net, a program that has been a savior to people when they were in crisis. Donât lose sight of the larger picture and Rick Santorum is the lead dog here in Pennsylvania. We need to take a critical look at the whole picture." Said Pennachio.</p>
<p>
<br />"This is the most radical administration in history and want to make a change to a one-party state. The use of scare tactics helps manipulate people to gain a political edge." He said.<br />The message at this forum was clear that the AARP is convinced that there is no problem with the Social Security fund and that our current administration really hasnât thought out the impact upon those individuals who would be at the most risk under the personal account system.</p>
