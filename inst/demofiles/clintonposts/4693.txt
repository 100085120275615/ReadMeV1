<blockquote>Republican John Spencer says Hillary Clinton "opposes the Patriot Act" when in fact she voted for the law in 2001 and again in 2006 when it was renewed.

<p>Additionally, Spencer claims "National Security Agency wiretaps of terrorist suspects were vital to stopping this attack" on US-bound airliners. Actually, US law enforcement played a relatively small role. British officials uncovered the alleged plot and quietly followed its development for months before alerting US officials just days before the arrests.</blockquote></p>

<blockquote>A Republican National Committee Internet ad uses video of Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania to make it seem he said something that he didn't. What Murtha said was US allies think the US presence in Iraq makes America a bigger threat to world peace than North Korea or Iran. He was citing overseas public opinion polls. The RNC ad edits his remarks to make it sound as though Murtha himself is asserting that thought.

<p>The same ad attracted widespread attention from liberal bloggers who pointed out evidence that an image of Democratic party chairman Howard Dean had been touched up to give him the hint of a Hitler moustache. The RNC quietly cleaned up the Dean image after being called out.</blockquote></p>
