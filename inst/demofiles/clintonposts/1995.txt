<p>
<span>"If the U.S. still thinks and brags that it still has this kind of power even after all these successive defeats in Vietnam, Beirut, Aden, and Somalia, then let them go back to those who are awaiting its return.ÃÂ </span>
</p>
<p>
<span>ÃÂWe have seen in the last decade the decline of the American government and the weakness of the American soldier who is ready to wage Cold Wars and unprepared to fight long wars. This was proven in Beirut when the Marines fled after two explosions. It also proves they can run in less than 24 hours, and this was also repeated in Somalia.ÃÂ</span>

</blockquote>Thanks, Bill. You made the country weaker and you inspired the terrorists. Anyway, Osama bin Laden was certainly right on many accounts. Parts of the US and the West <i>are</i> extraordinarily weak. Bill Clinton's Somalia response is proof of that.<br />
<br />However, the recent foiling of a major terror plot by British officials shows that gains have been made since 9/11 and we are, indeed, safer. Yet, Democrats <i>still</i> <a href="http://www.todayonline.com/articles/135835.asp">don't seem to understand what's going on</a>. <blockquote>
<span>"The war in Iraq has become a dangerous distraction and a profound drain on our<br />financial and military resources," said Senator John Kerry, Bush's rival for the<br />White House in 2004. "Osama bin Laden is still on the loose."</span> </blockquote>Hey, John, don't try to be too disappointed that the plot was foiled. Even aftsuccessfullylly ending the plot, Democrats try to make it sound like it's no big deal, or not <i>really</i> a victory.<br />
<br />And Senator Reid: <blockquote>
<span>"Terrorism remains the greatest threat to our security," said Harry Reid, the<br />top Democrat in the US Senate. "As a result of mismanagement and the wrong<br />funding priorities, we are not as safe as we should be."</span> </blockquote>Again, this right after the plot has been foiled. <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060810/ts_alt_afp/britainusattacks_060810235907">He continues</a>: <blockquote>
<span>"The Iraq war has diverted our focus and more than 300 billion dollars in resources from the war on terrorism and has created a rallying cry for international terrorists," Reid charged.<br />"This latest plot demonstrates the need for the Bush administration and the Congress to change course in Iraq and ensure that we are taking all the steps necessary to protect Americans at home and across the world."</span>
</blockquote>Uh, September 11th happened before the Iraq War. So did the Iranian hostage crisis, the killing of William Buckley, the Beirut embassy bombings, the Beirut barracks bombings, the Kuwait embassy bombings, the second Beirut embassy bombings, the hijacking of Kuwait airlines planes, the hijacking of TWA Flight 847, the seizing of the Achille Lauro, the Rome and Vienna airports bombings, the German disco bombings, Pan Am Flight 103 bombings over Lockerbie, Scotland, the first World Trade Center bombing, the failed attempt to blow up the UN and FBI buildings in New York, the barracks bombings in Saudi Arabia, the Khobar Towers military complex bombing, the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania bombings, the USS Cole bombing, etc. And now we've <i>foiled</i> a number of attacks <i>since</i> 9/11.<br />
<br />But that's not good enough for Democrats. Winning elections is more important than the safety of our nation. They'll tear down our troops ajeopardizeize the safety of 3millionion Americans for the chance to win a few more votes. They'll call a victory a defeat and downplay all successes, all to gain a political advantage.<br />
<br />Americans have a pretty clear choice when it comes to selecting a party to lead the charge against the barbarians. Americans have thusfar made the right decisions in all national elections so far. The Lieberman defeat and the foiled plot in Britain are just two more examples of why the US needs to stick with tough Republican leadership through these times. The Democrats are just plain wrong.</div>
