<blockquote>Palm Beach Chief of Police Michael Reiter has asked Rush Limbaugh's foe, State Attorney Bruce Krischer, to recuse himself from a case, believing he's in the tank for the defendant.<br />
<br />The accused is a dedicated Democrat, as is Krischer himself. The accused, Jefferey Epstein, has donated more than a $100,000 to Democrats, including Hillary! Clinton.<br />
<br />Reiter wants to charge Jeffrey Epstein for four counts of unlawful sexual conduct with a minor with girls as young as fourteen.<br />
<br />Krischer was somehow only able to get a prostitution charge against Epstein from a grand jury, despite a house filled with hidden cameras and pictures of young girls.<br />
<br />Reiter is seeking the aid of the FBI.<br />
<br />Note the DA didn't need to take the charges to a grand jury. He could have just filed charges on his own.<br />
<br />There were 17 witnesses against Epstein. Two "house managers" -- whatever they are; butlers and overseers, I guess -- are prepared to testify about having to clean up Jello and the like after Epstein's "parties" with the fourteen year old girls.<br />
<br />Krischer used the grand jury to tank the case, presenting the weakest case possible in order to have a pretext to not charge Epstein. That's the suspicion.<br />
<br />It seems like a good suspicion.<br />
