<span>When Katherine Harris said that "we have to have the faithful in government" she expressed nothing more than what some of the founding fathers have said.<br />

<em>
<span>"Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers, and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and interest of our Christian nation , to select and prefer Christians for their rulers."</span>
</em> <span>John Jay, <strong>First Chief Justice of the Supreme Court</strong> , The Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay, Henry P. Johnston, ed. (New York: G.P. Putnams Sons, 1890), Vol. IV, p. 365.<br />

<span>
<em>"When you become entitled to exercise the right of voting for public officers, let it be impressed on your mind that God commands you to choose for rulers, just men who will rule in the fear of God." "In selecting men for office, let principle be your guide. Regard not the particular sect or denomination of the candidate--look to his character." </em>-</span>- <span>Noah Webster, Letters to a Young Gentleman Commencing His Education to Which is Subjoined a Brief History of the United States (New Haven: S. Converse, 1823), p. 18.<br />
</span>
<span>
<span>(Name that "God"! Name that religion which the "sect or denomination" belonged to?? It wasn't Islam and it wasn't Buddhism and it wasn't Atheism. Take a look around, its CHRISTIAN churches that dot the landscape in every nook and crannyof this nation.) </span>
<br />

<em>"The people in general ought to have regard to the moral character of those whom they invest with authority either in the legislative, executive, or judicial branches. " "Those who wish well to the State ought to choose to places of trust men of inward principle, justified by exemplary conversation.</em> "</span> <span>-John Witherspoon, The Works of John Witherspoon (Edinburgh: J. Ogle, 1815), Vol. IV, p. 266. 267.</span>

<span>(Whose principles? The ones that change daily and operate by the political maxim "the end which enriches and empowers ME is always justified"? If so, call yourself a Clintonista, not a Republican,  Ruby RINO.)</span>

<span>Now I know all the <em>Hillary!</em>-loving groupies out there get all upset when anybody questions their patriotism. But tell me, after reading the above, are you going to accuse the Framers of the Consitution as "Christian Taliban" too? One wonders if today's</span>
<span> irreligious</span> <span>rabble could have had their way in 1789, would this Constitutional Republic have existed at all!<br />
