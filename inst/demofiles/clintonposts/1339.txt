<p><font size="2">It's amazing that anyone in the whole wide world takes the talk about Schwarzenegger in '08 seriously. Some <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20041114/D86BAJ8O0.html">do</a>, though, and some journalists&nbsp;dutifully regurgitate it, either because&nbsp;they don't know any better or it's good copy.&nbsp;This is even more fatuous than the establishment Dems' Hillary dreams. Do you honestly think 38 states are going to pass an Arnold amendment to clear a path for&nbsp;the Terminator's first term? Do you&nbsp;think it will even&nbsp;be an unqualified&nbsp;hit in the (nativist, anti-celeb) red states? Enough already. It's more plausible that Dick Cheney will expire in his bunker during the next four years and an animatronic&nbsp;replica will succeed GWB. </font></p>
