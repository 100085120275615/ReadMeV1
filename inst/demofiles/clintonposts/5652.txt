This music-related blog is going to take a short break to become political.  Music will return soon.<br /><br />This afternoon, I ventured down to Zip's Diner in Dayville, CT to catch Joe Lieberman on his Joementum tour.  I wanted to see whether or not there, um, was any Joementum.<br /><br />There wasn't.<br /><br />It was hot.  Very hot.  I started out early so I could case out the diner.  What a surprise to find this song playing on XM as I pulled out of the driveway:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/change.jpg" /><br /><br />"Change," indeed.  <br /><br />On my way to Dayville, I noticed some interesting stuff.  I noticed how hot it was outside:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/degrees.jpg" /><br /><br />I noticed how high gas prices were:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/gas.jpg" /><br /><br />I noticed the shopping plaza across from the diner, which has been vacant for over two years:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/ames.jpg" /><br /><br />When I arrived in the Zip's parking lot, I noticed that it was pretty much empty.  By 5:15, not many people had shown up:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/lot1.jpg" /><br /><br />I went into Zip's for a vanilla frappe.  The diner was pretty full, but it was almost early dinnertime.  There were a number of older folks there, and there were a few journalists (including my friend Chuck from the local paper).  The Lieberman "supporters" didn't start arriving until about 5:25; the bus pulled up soon after.  I figured that, if I stood outside, I would have a better chance of beating the crowd.<br /><br />But the crowd didn't come, and it <i>was</i> hot.  I decided to returned to the air conditioned comfort indoors.  I had already met a handful of Lamont supporters outside, including this lady, holding a "Bye, Joe!" sign:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/byejoe.jpg" /><br /><br />Inside, I met another three Lamont supporters sitting at the counter.  We all agreed that we were there because we wanted everyone to know how awesome it was to live in a democracy; to have a choice between two candidates.<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/insidebus.jpg" /><br /><br />I went back outside, again to find a good spot.  But I didn't need to rush.  Here is a photograph of everyone who came to support incumbent senator Joseph Lieberman:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/group1.jpg" /><br /><br />That was it.  The dude on the cellphone is from WINY, the local radio station.  The guy with the hat got off the bus.  The fellow with the video camera on the right is talking to a Lamont supporter.  I stayed far back so that the clean-cut youth (who got out of an Audi with Connecticut plates) didn't try to hand me a Lieberman sign.  I wanted to leave of my own accord, not to be kicked out.<br /><br />The bus stood still for a few minutes as reporters disembarked.  (I'm sure that the Lieberman campaign's pictures will end up on his website.)  This was the weird part: a man started shouting that everyone with signs (which had been provided by the guy in the Audi) should stand in front of the bus in order to create a photo op when Joe got off.  I don't know about the rest of you, but my mommy always told me never to stand in front of a bus.<br /><br />I went back inside so that I could get a better view of Joe:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/window.jpg" /><br /><br />He was wearing khakis and what looked like a Member's Only plaid shirt.  The sleeves were rolled up.  "He's trying to look like the 'common man,'" the man next to me remarked.<br /><br />As Lieberman made his way around to the entrance, the lady with the sign got pushed back to the periphery of the crowd:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/pushed.jpg" /><br /><br />I stood by the door so I could shake Joe's hand and get out of there.  The whole thing was so depressing that I didn't want to stay.  No one in the restaurant cared that Joe Lieberman was there.  The only people who did were Lieberman's supporters, who were nearly outnumbered (if not completely outnumbered) by the press.<br /><br />But I did want to shake Joe's hand.  I didn't wear my Lamont shirt; I didn't wear a bumper sticker on my forehead.  I wore my Clinton/Gore Inauguration '93 t-shirt:<br /><br /><img src="http://homepage.mac.com/bengott/.Pictures/shirt.jpg" /><br /><br />As Joe walked toward the steps, I held out my hand.  He shook it.  <br /><br />"Nice to meet you, Senator," I said.<br /><br />"You too," he said.  Then he looked at my shirt.  "I remember that; I was there," he said.<br /><br />"Yup," I said.<br /><br />"We'll do it again," he said, and then walked inside.<br /><br />Like I said, I didn't stay.  I neither wanted nor needed to.  My mind has been made up for months.  I support Ned Lamont because I agree with him and because I feel that Joe Lieberman no longer represents me.  I have lived in this area for six years.  This is the first time he's come anywhere near me.  Ned was in Killingly this past winter.  People remember things like that.<br /><br />As two great English pop stars <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=411405&s=143441&i=411389">once wrote</a>, "What has happened to the friend that I once knew, has he gone away? / When it's all too late, it's all too late..."<br /><br />Change.<br /><br /><b>UPDATE:</b>  Anonymous claims that WINY reported that there were 80 Lieberman supporters at Zip's.  I certainly didn't see 80 supporters, but I have contacted a friend who is a local reporter.  I hope he can clarify.  I'll keep you posted.
