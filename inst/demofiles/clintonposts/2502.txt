<div>"Every child in America will receive health care from day one if John is elected. Period," said Teresa Heinz Kerry on October 4, 2004, to a group of Democrats in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania.
<br />
<br />âFirst, we are going to make the same health care thatâs available to members of Congress available to all Americans. Weâre going to cover all the kids,â stated John Edwards in the Cheney-Edwards Vice-Presidential debate on October 5, 2004.
<br />
<br />âI have a plan. I have a plan to lower the cost of health care for you. I have a plan to cover all children. I have a plan to let you buy into the same health care senators and congressmen give themselves,â stated John Kerry in the second Bush-Kerry Presidential Debate on October 8, 2004.
<br />
<br />Sounds like Wonderland, doesnât it? Letâs see what others have said about the Kerry plan.
<br />
<br />Fiscal Policy in Campaign 2004, a brief issued on October 7, 2004, by The Concord Coalition, says that health care is a big fiscal question mark in Kerryâs plans. According to the brief, Kerryâs plan includes a proposal that would reduce the number of people who lack health insurance through a combination of expanded enrollment in the Medicaid and State Childrenâs Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), new health insurance pools for small employers and individuals, and reinsurance at an estimated net cost of $653 billion over 10 years.
<br />
<br />An assessment of the Kerry health care plan by the American Enterprise Institute (âAEIâ) found that the tax spending and savings provisions together would cost $1.3 trillion over a comparable time period (FY2006-2014). This is double what the Kerry plan assumes.
<br />
<br />According to AEI, the Kerry plan, which purports to help 27 million of an estimated 45 million uninsured individuals obtain coverage, would assume significant budgetary risk.
<br />
<br />Calculator please! Something doesnât add up here! AEI says the Kerry plan purports to help 27 of an estimated 45 million. How does that equate to ALL? Didnât John Edwards say ALL? And AEI also concluded that the plan would cost twice as much as what Kerry says it will cost.
<br />
<br />Letâs look at another assessment of the Kerry plan.
<br />
<br />A panel discussion at the Heritage Foundation, which included Joseph Antos of AEI, and John Sheils of the Lewin Group, was held on October 4, 2004. In this discussion, Levin agreed that the cost for Kerryâs plan was underestimated. Both groups agree that the number of Americans helped by the Kerry plan is on the order of 25 million. The way most calculators work, that equates to about 55 percent of the 45 million uninsured, not ALL.
<br />
<br />The biggest piece of the Kerry plan is his proposed expansion of Medicaid, which, according to Antos, would put âa lot more money into a program that is essentially dysfunctional.â And Kerry says his plan will cover all children. Lewinâs analysis shows that the proposed expansion of Medicaid would cover less than 60 percent of those under the age of 19. Joseph Lemieux, of Centrists.org, called parts of Kerryâs plan ânaÃ¯ve.â He also classified Kerryâs plan as more of a âprincipleâ than a âproposalâ and said it had been drafted to please âDemocratic partisans.â
<br />
<br />So the consensus seems to be that it will cost more than Kerry says, and cover less people than he promises. Weâve heard similar health care promises in recent years. Remember--Bill and Hillary were going to resolve the issue once and for all! Did it happen? No. Why? It seems there is one thing everyone has forgotten.
<br />
<br />Congress!
<br />
<br />Yes, Congress must approve this program and many believe the chances for that happening are slim to none.
<br />
<br />So, where does that leave Teresaâs promise that, "Every child in America will receive health care from day one if John is elected. Period." I wish that could be true, but there is one thing Teresa has forgottenâ¦â¦.Her husband is running for President of the United States, NOT KING!!
