<p>I am not republican, I don't pretend to be.  I voted Democrat twice (yep for Clinton) and Republican twice (yep, for Bush).  I am an independent (not undecided, just not a lemming to a specific party).</p>

<p>The 4th of July is a great time of year in Maine.  Fireworks, trips to the beach it is finally nice enough to be outside.  But the 4th of July has dark undertones at my house because I live next door to the former union hall for the paper unions which drove the paper industry out of Maine. </p>

<p>Now they call it a Solidarity Center and have a <a href="http://www.foodandmedicine.org/" target="_new">web site</a>.  Every year they have a celebration of socialism and unemployment, they decry Bush as a murderous capitalist in bed with Wal-Mart and the Oil industry.  They have food, music and information booths.  A couple of years ago they shot an effigy of Bush into the river with a catapult, the Democrat Governor of Maine clapping.  Last year it was the CEO of Wal-Mart.  Maybe I missed it this year, but I don't think they killed anyone this year.</p>

<p>The second band was good, but the first guy was the guy who comes every year.  His music is kind of folksy but not what you would call political.  He has one song popular with the solidarity crowd -- Bushie-scrooge.  Bushie-Scrooge is about Bush being visited by ghosts and then he renounces his ways -etc.  It is funny that even socialist moon-bats hold no hope of a Democrat victory and must rely upon ghosts to end the Bush administration -- even in their fantasies.</p>

<p>I will likely vote Democrat in 2008, if they come up with a candidate.  If it's Hillary I will be seriously considering the Republicans.  Back when, I voted for Clinton because I didn't like H Bush and wanted a younger president (Bush only got his first term because he was up against Dukakis and people liked Regan).  The second Clinton victory was because Dole scared the crap out of me.  The Bush victory was thanks to Gore being a moron, and I can not be party to anything that gives Tipper any power at all!  The second Bush victory was up to the fact that I wanted Bush to fix what he broke in Iraq and hoped he'd listen to Powell and Rice this term.  I am mad because he fired one and beat the other into his fucked up mindset.</p>

<p>Who is next?  I have no idea who is next on the 'publican side -- scary.  I think Hillary will pop up someday, but maybe not yet.  Who is next?  The Dems are scared to truly condemn the war (they should, it's their only platform).  The 'pulicans are scared to admit things are fucked up (North Korea is shooting missiles and Bush is watching fireworks?  WTF!?).</p>

<p>I have truly had it with the Publicrats (democans?).  I might vote "Green" just to hit the reset button on this fucked up country.  The Greens at least have a consistent message not muddled with hypocrisy.  Gore's fortune is wrapped up in trust funds heavily invested in Oil companies (well, maybe not anymore).</p>

<p>I think the Republicans are ignoring their moderates and listening to the far-far right too much right now, and the yellow Democrats are not listening to their far left who have a message and platform (thus the power of the Green Party).  There is no discussion right now because there is nothing to discuss and no representation to be found.  I can't identify with any party because none has a message worth repeating.  Should the NRA be happy about Cheney shooting a guy in the face while hunting, it pretty much sums of the argument of the anti-gun lobby.  Should small-government Republicans be happy with Bush who never met a spending package he didn't like?  Should Homeland security buffs clap when Bush wants to stop cracking down on the in-country illegals?  Are the Dems going to cash in on this or just hope people stop voting and then the candidate that votes for themselves wins?</p>
