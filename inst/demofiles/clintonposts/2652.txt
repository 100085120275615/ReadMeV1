<div><p><span>David Limbaugh's <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/3/27/231640.shtml">article</a> from March 28 points out the media's obvious double standard when it comes to politicians referring to God. As he concludes Limbaugh encourages us to examine the media's motive for their double standard:</span></p>

<p></p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><em><span>The next time the secular media crucify a conservative politician for openly professing the relevance of faith in his public life, try to remember their refusal to inflict the same rhetorical punishment on those in their ideological camp and ask yourself, "Why?"</span></em></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p></blockquote><p><span>Limbaugh's example on the conservative side is George Bush and for liberals, the Clintons. </span><span>There are many reasons the Clintons get a pass when it comes to their religious references but first among them I believe is the love this world has for the god of the Clintons. The god of the Clintons allows people to abort their babies, engage in homosexual sex and sex outside of marriage. The god of the Clintons brings no moral charge with him (or her perhaps) and allows man to be a god to himself. Much like the golden calf in the book of Exodus who was declared to be the âGod who brought us up out of the land of Egyptâ yet amazingly the people tell themselves that this god grants them the permission to rise up play (Exodus 32:6). The calf was simply the people making a god who tells them they can do what they want; this is the god of Bill and Hillary Clinton.</span></p>

<p><span>I am cautious about placing George Bush or any politician on a pedestal when it comes to the Christian faith but I do believe when George Bush speaks about God, he is referring to the one, true God. The God George Bush speaks about does not leave it to us to determine what is right and wrong but declares it to us and requires it of us. The hatred the media expresses against George Bush when he speaks about God is not hatred of Bush primarily but of the God Bush speaks of; sinful man hates God.</span></p>

<p><span>As we view the world of politics and the media it is vital for us as Christians to remember that there is spiritual reality behind everything our eyes see. The attempt to make us believe there is a god who permits us to live unholy lives without question is the work of the devil and those who preach this doctrine are his tools either knowingly or unknowingly.</span></p>

<p><span>I am not shocked when I see a double standard from the media I expect it. I find the world of politics quite interesting but some years ago I came to understand that it is not our realm as Christians by which I mean it is not where we are to concentrate our efforts. What the Church needs to do is to challenge and expose any claim to a god that is not the God revealed in Scripture. </span></p>
