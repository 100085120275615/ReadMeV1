Speaking of Pelosi, Hillary and endings, "Gone With The Wind" sounds like the absolutely perfect ending to Pelosi's ambition to be Speaker, and Hillary's presidential campaign. <br />Actually, any Republican opponent of Hillary's in 2008 could do a lot worse than link Hill with San Fran Nan. A natural campaign commercial would simply be a side-by-side comparison of the voting records of these 2 virago leftists, capped off by video footage of the florid sub-culture of San Francisco, with a voice-over asking "Is this what we want America to become?"
