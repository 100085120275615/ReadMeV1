<p>The 2008 election is over two years away.  The Dems must take <a href="http://www.townhall.com/opinion/column/kathleenparker/2006/04/28/195595.html">Sen. George Allen</a> pretty seriously as a candidate.  They are already busy branding the Senator as a racist.  Why?  Because he wore a Confederate Battle Flag pin in a high school picture.  Bill Clinton dodged the draft and used drugs.  That&#8217;s OK.  George Allen wore a pin and that must disqualify him for President.</p>
