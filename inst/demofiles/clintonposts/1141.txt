First, there was the Dick Morris best seller, "Condi vs. Hillary", promoting her candidacy. Since then, there has been a growing buzz about her potential candidacy on talk radio, on political tv (even discussed by Wolf Blitzer on CNN this past week) in newspaper columns, and especially on the Internet, as the number of  blogs boosting her candidacy has mushroomed(Of these,"<a href="http://www.condiblog.com/">Condiblog</a>" and <a href="http://condoleezza.blogspot.com/">"Blogs For Condi"</a> are particularly good ones.) The enthusiasm for her candidacy became palpable this past week when she addressed the Southern Baptist Convention in Greensboro, North Carolina on Wednesday.  According to the <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/1092.article">Associated Baptist Press</a>, Rice received a standing ovation upon being introduced, including a voice from the floor shouting out "You've got my vote!." <br />Condi was enthusiastically cheered throughout her speech.  The theme of her speech involved her communicating her vision of the U.S., given its' unique heritage of freedom, as having a similarly unique responsibility in the world to "<a href="http://www.abpnews.com/1092.article">liberate and spread freedom and justice."  </a>To <a href="http://www.abpnews.com/1092.article">quote Condi</a>:"If America does not serve great purposes, if we do not rally other nations to fight intolerance, to support peace and defend freedom...then our world will drift toward tragedy."<br />At the conclusion of her speech, this daughter of Birmingham, Alabama received a rousing standing ovation from the assemblage at the Geensboro Coliseum, who then broke into a spontaineous spirited singing of "God Bless America."  Bring on Hillary!
