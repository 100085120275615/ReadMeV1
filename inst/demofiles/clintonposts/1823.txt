</a>UPDATED BELOW with letter from Lamont<br />
<br />Lieberloser withdrew from the Democrat Party with his "I'm disappointed by the results.... I cannot and will not let that result stand" speech after losing tonight.<br />
<br />What an asshole!  The results are the VOICE of the Connecticut people.  He just gave a big "fuck you" to the Democrat Party (not to mention the voters of CT) with his announcement that he will be filing tomorrow to run as an independent in the CT general election in November. <br />
<br />I don't want to see a single Democrat (pay attention here Barbara Boxer) aiding his "independent" run.  I guess Lieberloser just doesn't understand that America is a democracy and the people in Washington work for those who elect them.   Joe just got handed a pink slip by the people of CT.<br />
<br />Lieberman is willing to cost the Democratic party a seat in the Senate to bandage his wounded ego (now an official three time loser - VP 2000, Pres 2004 and Senate 2006), and is crooked to a fault in the end with his crack about his $15 dollar a month site being "âhacked".  Hell, even I know enough not to complain about Blogger like that when it experiences its usual "unanticipated downtime".  That old saying about getting what you pay for and Leiberman went for cheap on his site.<br />
<br />Perhaps this really IS the start of Americans taking back America from those summabitches - a 21st century version of the Boston Tea Party.<br />
<br />According to Christy at <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/08/08/lamont-wins-primary/">Firedoglake</a>, word on the street in Connecticut is that Lieberman is running as an<span> independent with Republican backing.</span>   She also asks:<br />
<br />"The question is:  where will the DSCC and the party leadership<br />be on this tomorrow?  They had better be out in front and<br />supporting the winner of the Democratic primary."<br />
<br />Yes, Barbara Boxer and Big Dog Clinton, I do believe she was talking to you.<br />
<br />The  word on CT streets is not a surprise to anyone who paid attention to Lieberman's "concesion" speech - it sounded as if it was written by Rove himself.<br />
<br />Now is time for Harry Reid to strip Lieberman of all committee memberships, since he is, in his own words, NOT A DEMOCRAT anymore.   Click <a href="http://reid.senate.gov/contact/">here </a>to send your thoughts to Reid.<br />

<span>UPDATE:  Just got this email from Ned Lamont:</span>
<br />
<br />Suzanne,<br />
<br />We won!<br />
<br />There's been a lot said in the media about you, about me and about this race. But let me cut right through it and tell you what just happened.<br />
<br />Tonight's results show clearly and overwhelmingly one simple fact: democracy works. Connecticut came alive with participation and passion. Together, Democrats decided that it's time for a change.<br />
<br />It's been a spirited campaign, but today we are all Democrats.<br />
<br />Unfortunately, though, Joe Lieberman has announced his intention to run as an independent.<br />
<br />I've said from the beginning, even when Joe Lieberman had a 50-point lead in the polls, that I would respect the outcome of this race. I even said that if Joe Lieberman won the Democratic nomination, I'd campaign for him through the fall to turn out votes for the Democrat.<br />
<br />We Democrats have a process for choosing our nominee, and we all ought to respect the outcome. I hope that over the course of the coming days, Joe's friends, neighbors and constituents will prevail upon him to reconsider and unite with the Democrats across Connecticut who voted for change tonight.<br />
<br />Joe needs to hear from you. Please send him a message asking him to respect the voters -- we will deliver your note and post it on our web site:<br />

<br />
<br />Victory has never been a sure thing -- not even close. Back when I decided to run, I had no idea how many people felt the same way I did. But there was no choice -- I couldn't sit by while our Senator continued to aid and abet this president, his administration, and its course in Iraq.<br />
<br />When this campaign started, we were just a blip on the radar. We were 50 points down in the polls and our operation was little more than a few card tables and bumper stickers. Just a few months later, we have turned politics on its head.<br />
<br />The establishment and the pundits have their own ideas about this race, but don't forget the real story. It's a story of expanding the political process and demanding a real, substantive debate on the things that matter to real people.<br />
<br />I've met so many people and had so many conversations about their hopes for a better America -- about the war, about their job security, about their children's future. But what's been so special about this campaign is the fact that my conversations are just a tiny fraction of what's happened across Connecticut. People are having these conversations with each other again, and our political process is better for it.<br />
<br />No matter the issue, one thing is clear: we've brought new energy to our democracy. And that's the type of victory where we all win.<br />
<br />Please send him a note asking him to respect the voters now:<br />

<br />So many people have put so much into this campaign -- on both sides.<br />
<br />I hope that we can persuade Joe to not throw all that work away. The Democratic Party and our democratic process will benefit.<br />
<br />Thank you for all that you have done so far, and I will be in touch again soon.<br />
