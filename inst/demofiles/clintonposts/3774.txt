<div>Yes, a liberal newspaper in my town has endorsed Hillary NOT running in 2008!<br />
<br />I actually posted on this first on my other website....<a href="http://pekinprattles.blogspot.com/2006/02/hillarygoin-down-by-tampa-tribune.html">and you can read it and the editorial here!</a>
<br />
<br />Speaks volumes when a local paper of liberal leaning already sees Hillary as a liability for 2008.<br />
