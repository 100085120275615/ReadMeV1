<span id="a10bl">Potential White House hopeful Rudy Giuliani raised an eye-popping $2 million to spread to Republican campaigns last night at his first fund-raiser in over a year. <p> The haul for Giuliani's political-action committee, Solutions America, demonstrated "America's Mayor's" cash-raising prowess. </p>
<p> And it far exceeded his aides' earlier projections - dwarfing the $1 million that his main potential 2008 primary rival, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), raised a day earlier. </p>
<p> "There's a long way to getting to 2008," Giuliani told the crowd of over 200 people at the Four Seasons restaurant. He said the focus should be on 2006 and keeping Congress under GOP control - instead of on the White House race. </p>
<p> Giuliani aides also introduced the PAC's Web site, which includes an archive of articles going back to 1997 - but contains none from 2000, the year of Giuliani's aborted Senate run against Hillary Rodham Clinton. </p>
<p> The ex-mayor was introduced by Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman, and the crowd featured candidates Giuliani has helped in key presidential states. </p>
</span>If this story doesn't make the rest of the potential '08 pack a little nervous, I don't know what would.</div>
