<p>Lindsay Lohan says she wants to go to Iraq with Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and entertain American troops there.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been trying to go to Iraq with Hillary Clinton for so long. Hillary was trying to work it out, but it seemed too dangerous,&#8221; the 20-year-old actress says in an interview in the September issue of Elle magazine, on newsstands Wednesday.</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;It&#8217;s so amazing seeing that one woman just going somewhere, this beautiful sex kitten, who&#8217;s basically a pinup, which is what I&#8217;ve always aspired to be</strong>,&#8221; Lohan tells the magazine, adding that she would prepare for her trip to Iraq by taking shooting lessons with her security guard. </p>

<p>A couple of things come to mind:</p>
<p>1. Does Lindsay aspire to be a pinup or just your run of the mill &#8216;beautiful sex kittenâ?<br />
2. Shooting lessons? Are we that desperate that we need her help against the insurgents?</p>
