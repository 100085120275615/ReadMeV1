I certainly participated in multiple planning and debate sessions about them. There were good arguments on both sides ... But for the record, I do share a concern that the lawsuits have outlived most of their usefulness and that the record companies need to work harder to implement a strategy that legitimizes more p2p sites and expands the download and subscription pool by working harder with the tech community to get devices and music services to work better together"<br /><br />Rosen went on to say, "Speaking of DRM, it is time to rethink that strategy as well." but failed to give any details on how her version of a DRM or non-DRM universe would look and act. <br /><br />Rosen is on point when she says that the lawsuits have outlived their useful lifespan. New suits tend to bring anti-RIAA press to a boil for a few days, especially when the named defendant is <a href="http://www.cdfreaks.com/news/12441">young</a>, <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,98190,00.html">old</a>, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20050204-4587.html">dead</a> or <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?threadid=245416">without a computer</a>. The RIAA are crafting a villainous persona in the press, and where the original public spin on the lawsuits pointed in favor of the RIAA a very serious shift has occurred towards the side of the consumer. When Hillary Rosen tells you to go work with the technology in order to grow your business rather than suing what remains of it out of existence, we can only hope the current management over at the RIAA takes heed of the warning offered by a former colleague.<br /><br />[via <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/hilary-rosen/for-the-record-for-what-_b_22177.html">The Huffington Post</a>]<br /></div>
