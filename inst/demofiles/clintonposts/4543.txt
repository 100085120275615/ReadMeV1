<p>I just heard an amazing speech by George Galloway telling us Americans how it is about Bush, his buddies, and their war (that they, nor their children are fighting) and then I check on the Lieberman campaign to find he&#8217;s been defeated by an anti-war candidate from his own party in Connecticut.</p>
