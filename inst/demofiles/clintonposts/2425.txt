<span>Took my kids to a Pro-Bush Rally to greet Mr. Kerry in my hometown.  What a great time!  It feels sooooo good to be a part of the good part of America.  I thought it was a good lesson for my children "Freedom of Speech".  About 50 supporters showed up.  My 6 year old really got into it.  Of course the media didn't really give us much coverage (what a surprise) nor did they give coverage to the Dems swearing at us and using obscene gestures (another big surprise).  We handled ourselves with the dignity and respect that Republicans are known for, I was proud!!!</span>

<span>In other news...Kerry lies again.  Or is it HIS reality.  Kerry meets with the ENTIRE UN Security Counsil to discuss Iraq.  Okay...... Except that it NEVER happened.  I think I caught a small blurb about it on the news last night, but of course it came from FOX News.  This man is seriously disturbed!!!  The Security Counsil says "we were just as surprised to hear Senator Kerry say that".  I'm sorry but anyone who votes for this lunatic is just as crazy as he is!!!  Then we have the Dems creating voter fraud (no big surprise there).  If Kerry wins this election (which I highly doubt) it will be a stolen Presidency, no doubt about it.  I hope they get caught.  The Democrats are in serious trouble...hence Clinton coming out of his sick bed.  These people will stop at nothing.</span>
