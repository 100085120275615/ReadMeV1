<div>I recieved an interesting email from a friend today. You may disagree, but you can't deny the similarities:<br />

<blockquote>
<p>
<br />Tokyo Rose</p>
<p>During World War II, the Japanese were searching for a way to demoralize the American forces that they faced. Their Psychological Warfare experts came up with a message they thought would work well. They gave the script to their famous broadcaster "Tokyo Rose" and everyday she would broadcast this same message packaged in various ways hoping to have an impact on American GI morale.</p>
<p>What was the message? It had three main points:</p>
<p>1. Your president is lying to you.</p>
<p>2. This war is illegal.</p>
<p>3. You cannot win the war.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? Maybe it's because the Democrat Party has picked up the same message and is broadcasting it to our troops. The only difference is that they claim to support our troops before they demoralize them. Come to think of it, Tokyo Rose used to tell our troops she was on their side.</p>
<p>Think about this next Election Day. Let's see how many people vote for Tokyo Hillary, Tokyo Harry, Tokyo Teddy, Tokyo Nancy, Tokyo Schumer, or Tokyo John. </p>
