Now back to the privacy issue, it seems that Hillary <strike><font color="red">Rotten</font></strike> Roddham Clinton is going against her ACLU counterparts and starting to demand that camera be installed in American city's. <p><br />I can here the privacy hawks now, "But that's an invasion of our privacy!!!". Well first off when you are outdoors on the public streets and side walk there is nothing private about that. Secondly if your so concerned about it don't do anything against the law and you won't have anything to worry about.<br /><p><br />(Hat tip: <a href="http://www.drudgereport.com"><font color="green">Drudge</font></a>)
