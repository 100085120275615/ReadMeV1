<p>Russ Feingold is probably one of the very few congress persons that even comes close to resembling  &#8220;responsible&#8221;.  However, there are a few things that need explaining.</p>
<p>Russ Feingold is a <i><b>far, far</b></i> better choice than Hillary Clinton. Rather than say how low-life Hillary is, let&#8217;s just say that Russ Feingold is a <b><u>much, much</u></b> more honest and responsible person than Hillary Clinton. Neither is perfect, but there is a vast difference. Compare their voting records (see a sample of Hillary&#8217;s record posted above in this thread). Hillary is not only quite fond of pork-barrel, but there has been some very shady stuff goings-on.  </p>
<p><i><b><u>Not</u></b></i> Feingold.  Russ Feingold does deserve some credit for being one of the very, very few congress persons that does <u>not</u>  vote on a lot of pork-barrel.  </p>
<p>Still, people should consider Senator Russ Feingold&#8217;s record closely too.  It&#8217;s not perfect.  Russ Feingold (D-WI)<b>:</b><br />
<ul><li>Voted NO on banning more types of Congressional gifts. (Jul 1995) </li><br />

<li>Voted YES on establishing a Guest Worker program. (May 2006) (a.k.a. amnesty)</li><br />

<li>Voted YES on giving Guest Workers a path to citizenship. (May 2006) (figures)</li><br />
<li>Voted NO on Social Security Lockbox & limiting national debt. (Apr 1999) , but also &#8230; (they want to keep plundering the surpluses; it&#8217;s a ponzi scheme)</li><br />
<li>Voted NO on allowing personal retirement accounts. (Apr 1998) (OK, but voting NO to shore up S.S. also)</li><br />

<li>said: &#8220;Move the US Embassy to Jerusalem.&#8221; (Nov 1995) (???)</li><br />
<li>Voted NO on across-the-board spending cut. (Oct 1999) (course not: congress does not want to be fiscally responsible </li></ul><br />
People should <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~d.a.n/WhatAllVotersShouldDo1.htm" rel="nofollow"><b>check out</b></a> politicians&#8217; voting records &#8230;  they may be surprised by what they find &#8230; and if not, it further demonstrates how, so, so <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~d.a.n/WhatAllVotersShouldDo2.htm" rel="nofollow"><b>very low</b></a> the bar is set.</p>
<p>At any rate, the Democratic party would be wise to take a more serious look at Russ Feingold than Hillary Clinton, or most any other politician.</p>
