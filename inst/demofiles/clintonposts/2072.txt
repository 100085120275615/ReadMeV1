<b>Dear Hecate,<br />
<br />I want to send a personal note of thanks to all of you who joined me in our difficult fight to get the FDA to approve the use of Plan B without a prescription, at least for women over age 18. <br />
<br />Making Plan B available over the counter has the potential to prevent millions of unplanned pregnancies. This decision is long overdue: for years, the Bush administration and its ideological allies refused to recognize the scientific evidence that Plan B was both safe and effective.<br />
<br />Senator Patty Murray of Washington and I have agreed that we will lift our hold on the nomination of Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach to be FDA commissioner now that the FDA has made a decision. We hope he'll provide the strong scientific leadership the FDA needs and deserves.<br />
<br />But this three-year effort to make one more reproductive health option available to American women is another reminder that we have to insist that policy decisions should be made on the basis of science, not ideology.<br />
<br />We never would have succeeded if we had not held firm -- and if we had not been able to count on your support. This fight isn't over yet. There are questions about the age restriction and other conditions imposed by the FDA. We know that we have to keep working to support womenâs reproductive health choices. Meanwhile, this decision is a victory for American women -- and that's something to celebrate! <br />
<br />Again, thank you so much for your invaluable support.</b>

<br />I'm not at all expert on Plan B, but were I a woman of child-bearing age, I'd acquire several doses NOW and put them in my medicine cabinet, assuming that they have a shelf-life of even a year.  That way, I wouldn't worry about whether or not some self-appointed morals policeman working behind a drug-store cash register would give me a hard time when I (or a friend of mine) desperately needed the medicine nor that I'd have to ride a bus to several different drug stores before finding one that stocked Plan B.  Good on Hillary Clinton and good on Patty Murray for keeping the pressure on the Bush junta and the FDA.</div>
