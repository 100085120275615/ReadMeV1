Machiavellian . . . evil, power-mad witch . . . the ultimate self-serving politician. . . Criminal . . . megalomaniac . . . fraud . . . dangerous . . . devil incarnate . . . satanic . . . power freak.â</blockquote> Geez, you say that like it's a <i>bad</i> thing. Shrinking violet Larry Sabato weighs in as well: In the race for the nomination, âshe is ripe for plucking.â Yeah, tell that to Bill...</p>
