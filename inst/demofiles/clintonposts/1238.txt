<a href="http://technorati.com/tag/%5Btagname%5D" rel="tag"></a>While I don't think that hell has frozen over, it must be getting rather nippy.  The reason?  It appears that <s>Carpetbagger</s> Senator Hillary Clinton and I agree on something.  Scary, I know.  But she has one thing right, and for that I must give her credit (even if it is part of her sprint toward the middle): <a href="http://today.reuters.com/investing/financeArticle.aspx?type=bondsNews&storyID=2006-02-17T153506Z_01_N17197464_RTRIDST_0_SECURITY-CONGRESS-PORTS.XML">she opposes</a> the potential atrocity that is the Dubai-US port deal.   And her sentiments on the deal, unlike her sentiments on most everything else, are fairly unequivocal:<br /><blockquote>I will be working with Senator Menendez [D-New Jersey] to introduce legislation that will prohibit the sale of ports to foreign governments.</blockquote>The article says nothing substantive of the Republican stance.   I hope the Republican majorities grow a pair and start acting like the Republican majorities we put in office; they can start by  blocking this deal (and quelling Bush's spending frenzy, and subduing Bush's desire to give illegal immigrants amnesty, etc.).<br /><span class="fullpost"></span>
