<span>I won't comment much on President Bush's State of the Union address. All I have to say is that he hit a grandslam! The Democrats' response: pathetic! And I'm not being partisan here. Reid and Pelosi?!?! I know that they're the minority leaders in the Senate and House, but come on! You don't see us putting Hastert and Delay in the limelight. What about Obama, or even Hillary. Granted, I disagree with them, but at least it would have been an interesting, charismatic response. And why did Reid begin with his humble background in NV? I hate it when pols do that for no other reason than just to bore us! Edwards doing it at the Democratic National Convention is fine, it was effective and inspiring, but not this:</span>

<span>"Hello, I'm Harry Reid. With me is the sexiest member of the House who we could find to be our minority leader, Nancy Pelosi. I grew up in a shack, in a tiny Nevada city called Searchlight (it's not Hope, Arkansas, but there's still a cute ring to it). My dad was a hard rock miner. My mom took in wash. I remember when Abe Lincoln was just an unsuccessful candidate for Congress. I had lunch last week in my hometown a few weeks ago. I ordered a western omelette, and a 10 year old boy told me that he wants to be me when he grows up. I told him to reach higher goals, like becoming the Senate MAJORITY Leader. Today a group of us visited FDR's memorial, and stood around his statute for a photo-op on how we'll do nothing to his Social Security program. It was nice. I remember voting for FDR...."</span>

<span>WHO CARES! As Jon Stewart of the Daily Show would say, "For a fun second term drinking game, chug a beer every time you hear the phrase 'contentious but futile protest vote by Democrats.' By the time Jeb Bush is elected, you'll be so wasted you won't even notice the war in Syria."

<span>Speaking of a "contentious but futile protest vote by Democrats," the Senate confirmed Alberto Gonzales as our new attorney general, by a vote of 60-36. Let's compare this confirmation vote with the one Ashcroft received in 2001:
<br />
</span>
<br />
<span>Dates: Gonzales: Feb. 3; Ashcroft: Feb. 1</span>
<br />
<span>Roll Call: Gonzales: 60-36; Ashcroft: 58-42
<br />
</span>
<br />
<span>Yep, the Dems really put up a fight this time!!! A two day difference, but a two vote gain (note, if Burns (R-MT) had voted, it would have been a three vote gain, so much for filibusters). Let's see which Dems voted for Ashcroft and Gonzales.
<br />
</span>
<br />
<span>Ashcroft Yeas: Breaux (D-LA), Byrd (D-WV), Conrad (D-ND), Dodd (D-CT), Dorgan (D-ND), Feingold (D-WI), Jeffords (R-VT), Miller (D-GA), Nelson (D-NE)
<br />
</span>
<br />
<span>Gonzales Yeas: Landrieu (D-LA), Lieberman (D-CT), Nelson (D-NE), Nelson (D-FL), Pryor (D-AR), Salazar (D-CO)</span>
<br />
<span>Gonzales Not Voting: Baucus (D-MT), Conrad (N-ND), Inouye (D-HI)
<br />
</span>
<br />
<span>Why does this matter? First, note the Dems who voted for Gonzales. They all supported Condi Rice's nomination, they all claim to be "moderates" (with the exception of Inouye), and this is a preview of who we can pick-off votes from in the future (yes, even Social Security and perhaps judicial nominees). Second, Lieberman (did you see Bush kiss him last night lol?) and the two Nelsons are up for re-election in 2006; so is Conrad, who didn't vote, but did support Ashcroft's nomination in '01 (add him to the Yeas, Gonzales would have 62 votes). In sum, if Bush's most controversial cabinet nominee receives votes like this, the Senate is virtually filibuster-proof.</span>
