<br />* <a href="http://www.econopundit.com/archive/2004_01_01_econopundit_archive.html#107357414583132319">Econopundit cites powerful econometric evidence</a> that the tax cut actually created 1 million more "unemployed" people....by encouraging 1 million more people to join the labor force. 
<br />
<br />It's hard to dislike a tax cut that makes Americans want to work harder.

<br />* Captain Ed calls the Moveon.org awards show a "<a href="http://captained.blogs.com/captains_quarters/2004/01/democrats_feel_.html">vulgarian's delight</a>".  I'm less concerned with the fact that there's invective - hey, it is politics - and more concerned with the impression that the invective seems to be crowding out any rational discussion of the issues.   The roar of idiotarians is drowing out the discourse of the intelligentsia.

<br />* If your blog was graded, would you pass?   <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2004/01/alex_on_bloggin.html">That day may come soon</a>, according to Tyler Cowen.   (<em>which makes me wish I could go to George Mason U - uh, after I learned to write like I know what I'm talking about</em>)

<br />* Via <a href="http://www.right-thinking.com/">Right-Thinking</a> - this is exactly why <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~scuzi/224Helicopter_Kills.mpeg">it's a bad idea to F* with US troops</a>.   In graphic detail.

<br />* <a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/000557.html">Jesse Taylor manages to suggest that</a>, since Larry Lindsey has been honest and disagreed with the Bush administration before, he's untrustworthy when he agrees with the Bush administration now.   Got it?   Course, just yesterday, they were calling that sort of personal criticism "<a href="http://www.pandagon.net/mtarchives/000548.html">character assassination</a>".

<br />* <a href="http://www.marcnet.org/marcland/archives/000377.html">Baby pictures</a>!   Marc is having a boy!   (<em>unless it's a girl</em>)  Either way, congratulations.   You'll be amazed, when you're not exhausted.

<br />* Galen also <a href="http://galenslog.typepad.com/galens_log/2004/01/babies_and_spam.html">has a picture of his new baby</a> - uh, followed by a discussion of spam that I never want to read in a post about babies.  "Penis enlargement spam"?  New post, bro.  Some separation.  
<br />
<br />...the baby is beautiful, though.   He's also got a <a href="http://galenslog.typepad.com/galens_log/2004/01/hillarys_propos.html">good post about Hillary Clintons new health care proposal</a> - and in case you didn't catch it the last time I mentioned it, he's a doctor so his insight is credible.

<br />* <a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2004/01/dean_and_daddy_.html">Professor Bainbridge on Howard Dean's "Daddy Issues"</a> - not that Howard Dean really has them, but if Dean wants to pull that rhetoric out for his duel with President Bush, then he's picked his weapons.  </strong>
