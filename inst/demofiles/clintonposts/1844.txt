<br />I saw this picture of President Bush as Hitler on a blog run by a liberal loon called KAY IN MAINE.<br />
<br />(If you can stomach it--- http://www.whitenoiseinsanity.blogspot.com )<br />
<br />She put this disgusting picture of our President up and I had to respond to it. I had no idea who this woman was or why she did that, but I felt she needed a response to this outrage.<br />
<br />What follows is the exchange KAY THE LOON IN MAINE and her echo chamber nuts proceeded to have with me. I was having fun with them but they were serious and you can see for yourself just how over the edge they are.<br />
<br />THESE are the modern day Democrat Party members.<br />
<br />Vote accordingly.<br />
<br />Keep in mind this âconversationâ is over a five-day period of time.<br />I kept going back to tweak them and they kept feeding me the filth they call liberalism. This experiment has led to the perfect example for you of how insane the left has become.<br />
<br />I have not edited this and the spelling mistakes from the loons and bad grammar is standard for the Nutroots on the left. For the true taste of what is going on with the Democrats on the Internet read the entire exchange, it gets better and better as it goes on.<br />
<br />You may also want to know these libs on the liberal sites always assume I work for the White House or The Republican National Committee. I had an exchange with some of the whackos on Americablog, which is a loon site, and they all accused me of being a shill for Bush. Whenever you beat them at logic and facts they always accuse you of being a paid blogger. God forbid I actually BELIEVE what I am saying. To a liberal that is impossible. NO one would actually AGREE with the President!<br />
<br />I print this as a public service to the uniformed sane people who, until they saw this, did not believe what I have been saying about the liberals on the Internet.<br />
<br />If it gets too much for you scroll down to the breaker bar and read the comments from my readers and my final thoughts on what this all means.<br />

<br />KAY IN MAINE:<br />
<br />Your picture on your site of Bush as Hitler is offensive and an affront to all who fought and died in WWII, not to mention to Jews.<br />
<br />You are out of control and so hate filled you should be BANNED from any and all sites on the internet.<br />
<br />That picture is NOT funny nor does it say anything but how hateful and spiteful you libs are.<br />
<br />ANYONE who disagrees with you and how you ran this country into the ground for 40 years is attacked personally.<br />
<br />You should be ashamed of yourself, but I know libs have no shame.<br />Sat Jul 08, 06:03:52 PM 2006<br />

<br />Hey MTI, the fact that I FOUND THAT PICTURE ON GOOGLE AFTER SEARCHING IMAGES, just goes to show you that I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO THINKS BUSH AND HITLER ARE THE SAME!!!!!!!<br />
<br />What I find offensive IS THERE ARE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO ARE SUPPORTING A PRESIDENT WHO SUPPORTS TEARING DOWN THE FOUNDATION OF OUR COUNTRY!!! 750+ signing statements to ignore the laws of our country? Sure!!!! Bush thinks he is the Imperial King of America! So guess what? I FIND THAT MORE OFFENSIVE THAN A PICTURE OF BUSH AS HITLER!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />You're the one with the problem not me. You're the backwash of our country....a backwash consisting of scum, liars, deceivers, bacteria, and lame excuses for your Fuehrer!<br />Sun Jul 09, 07:36:12 AM 2006<br />

<br />Here's what I wrote on "MTI"'s blog:<br />
<br />Hi Looney Cepan! Wow, what a positive, uplifting blog you have? End Times? And you're not blaming Bush for it? Wow, blaming liberal blogs, huh? Weirdo!!!!!!!! Who will you blame for the destruction of the world? The Ancient Egyptian Pharoahs? I bet! Because you can't bring yourself to blame Bush for anything!!! No wonder you are only part of the backwash of our nation and I represent the two thirds of the nation who think YOUR PRESIDENT is the worst and most frightening to the foundation of our country! You are to blame along with him.<br />Sun Jul 09, 07:41:20 AM 2006<br />

<br />Kay In Maine:<br />
<br />Now, I know you are the Queen of the loons, I've been to your hate filled site with the Bush as Hitler photo and the rantings and ravings of a lunatic.<br />
<br />But PLEASE gets your facts right.<br />
<br />1/3 of the country is Republican and correct on the issues.<br />
<br />1/3 Of the country is Liberal and insane.<br />
<br />1/3 of the country has no clue and is waiting for someone to tell them where they go to vote.<br />
<br />YOU are the 1/3 that is insane.<br />
<br />Now that you know that you can be on your way to a cure!<br />
<br />Your use of the term, "Backwash" to describe the MAJORITY of people in this country who are NOT loons like you tells much about how you view people that disagree with you and that actually like America.<br />
<br />Your "Blame Bush" for your everything including your ingrown toenails and bad skin is getting old.<br />
<br />Time to go back to your little New England hole and let the adults run the country.<br />

<br />Hey MTI! You are the BackWash...the left over crap that no one wants to drink and just pours down the drain. Two thirds of the nation is on my side babe, not yours. Even republicans in the Congress are starting to turn on your Fuehrer and us libs love it!!! We love it!!!!! I can't wait for Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell (who represent you..the BackWash) to say in the near future, "EWwwwwwwww, those guys in the White House are not good for our nation. Very BackWashy!". LOL<br />
<br />Keep trying to be informed and intelligent like us liberals. It will be a long road for you to achieve that especially since you have to open your mind up and view the world with a blank slate and ask, "Is this good for our country?"..."Is this what our founding forefathers wanted?"..."I love my country more than I love my party!". See? You're gonna have a hard time reaching our level. I feel sorry for you.<br />Mon Jul 10, 07:54:54 AM 2006<br />

You support the outing of a CIA operative's identity during a time of war and we do not. You support the Admin sueing the NY Times for reporting on what your Fuehrer is doing illegally and we do not.

Of course, I'm sure you'll send us pictures of the NeoNazi party because this is pretty much who supports Bush at the moment. Yeah, and they're training in Iraq now...you know...LIKE ALL GOOD TERRORISTS ARE DOING. Thank God Bush opened up Iraq, huh? Now the American terrorists in addition to the Arab terrorists have A WHOLE COUNTRY TO TRAIN IN! Wow, that is some Fuehrer you got there.

<br />Bush has always been on the side of terrorists, because why else would he stand down on 9/11 to allow the attack to happen? And why else would he illegally invade and occupy Iraq? This is exactly what Osama wanted. He wanted to train in Iraq and Bush opened it up for him. Osama also wants to see our economy collapse and for America to lose it's power against the world. Wow! That is happening too. Yup, Bush werkin hahd for the terrorists. It's hahd werk.<br />Tue Jul 11, 07:49:52 AM 2006<br />

<br />The news race stats only prove which shows are aired late night and the ones that are aired during the day, affected by the amount of people watching them. If your not up at night watching the "real" shows you're stuck with Billy O'.<br />So combine all the numbers below Bill's show that are real and it clearly outweighs Bill's number.<br />Colmes from Faux's H&amp;C slammed the neocons when they thought they found the WMD's stating the defense dept never confirmed them.<br />End of story. You should of seen their faces. Also, the red Senator flashed, on screen, a confidential document saying he had proof. We won't be seeing him anymore...<br />The Fox people always get caught with their pants down. It's hilarious!!!!<br />

<br />YOU are a moron by the way.<br />
<br />There were WMD's in Iraq and you know it. Clinton knew it, Kerry Knew it, Reid Knew It, Pelosi had no clue, as usual.<br />
<br />They are in Syria as we speak. The ones we have found are just the tip of the iceberg.<br />
<br />Have you seen the Iraqi general who proved that they were moved during the 14 months we gave Saddam to do so?<br />
<br />Why are you loons so eager to believe they just never existed when we knew he used them against his own people?<br />
<br />The mass graves we keep finding prove that.<br />

<br />The "supposed" reason your president started the war with Iraq was that they had WMD's. Now if the "WMD's are in Syria, why didn't we attack them, even if we knew that they were hidden there by Saddam?<br />This country needs to learn to mind it's own business. Bottom line, both of our sides want what's right for this country. Difference is, is that your side's ignorance to what the true people want will bring us down, including you buddy. You'r only 1/3 of this country who's propaganda is influencing the rest. They'll figure your side out eventually and hope it won't be too late by then. You don't need to be a history major to know this. It's easy enough to figure out with all the shit going on with your side, that it compares to what happened with Nazi Germany that everyone is aware of.<br />

<br />I'd love to know when that list was posted. Is it from 2 years ago? (Of course, our uneducated neocon didn't provide a link so we could look and see when the list was generated and by who) Okay, let's say for instance that the list is accurate and true. It explains why 31% of the country still thinks Bush is wonderful and doing a fabulous job! Over 1 million people are being brainwashed by Fox News to think that!!!! So, MTI, YOUR LIST EXPLAINS A LOT AND ANSWERS A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR US. Thanks!<br />
<br />How many Iraqis were killed by Saddam before Bush illegally invaded and occupied Iraq (and who has now killed more Iraqis than Saddam could ever dream of doing!)? Don't you think it's a little weird that Saddam is on trial right now for 'killing' 143 people? That's it? He killed 143 people and Bush decided to take him out? For the love of the Pizza Monkey.......BUSH KILLED 30,000 IN AN INSTANT IN THE FIRST HOURS OF BOMBING IN MARCH OF 2003! And where are the mass graves with thousands and thousands and thousands of bodies that you right wingers keep talking about? Oh yeah! Just more right wing Bush Family neocon Fascist propaganda to convince Americans over the years that Saddam could kill all of us here in America even though our country HAS 10,000 NUCLEAR WARHEADS AT THEIR DISPOSAL AND COUNTLESS CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS TOO!<br />
<br />MTI, you're stupid and are the insane one. Don't forget that loser. Think you came to a blog run by a woman who is going to back down to you? Huh! I'm not a coward, pal. I ENJOY YOU SHOWING THE GOOD PEOPLE OF THIS NATION WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SOME AMERICANS GO BAD.<br />

<em>Thu Jul 13, 07:35:58 PM 2006 The only reason why I'm posting this conversation is because MTI (or Cepan) is a coward neocon who is commenting only on a previous post, which is waaaaaayyyyyyyy down near the bottom of this page. Why won't he comment on others posts or at least continue his conversation with us near the top so it is easier for everyone? Because MTI is a coward! Yes! He's a neocon, Bush supporting, coward. He knows he's an imbecile and doesn't want anyone new coming to my blog to read what he has been writing to us and to figure that out for themselves! At one point, he told me that he is coming to my blog to teach me a lesson. LOL This neocon Bush supporter is completely insane and he's proven his insanity on Americablog too. So 'enjoy' reading our conversation! (understand that this conversation has taken place over the last few days) (also....I've posted a link to MTI's blog on the sidebar under "Favorite American Taliban Links"! Go check it out! The man is insane!!!!</em>(Americablog is a web site run my liberals who hate Bush).<br />

<br />You don't start a new conversation in an unrelated blog subject when you are talking about previous comments on this entry.<br />
<br />You people are so stupid it is a sin.<br />
<br />And because KAY THE LOON IN MAINE does not know how blogs work, she starts ANOTHER entry attacking me like a fool.<br />
<br />Send all your loons to my site. Thanks!<br />
<br />They can see what the normal people are like for a change.<br />
<br />If I am a coward that's news to me and the people applauding me for attacking you and your disgusting site.<br />(You have been great lunch time entertainment for many people in DC).<br />
<br />I have no interest in commenting on other entries here because they are all just rants and insanity.<br />
<br />I have just been having my fun tweaking you idiots.<br />
<br />You are no more able to understand reality than Al Gore the Ozone Man is, so why waste my time.<br />
<br />(I will say that KAY THE LOON IN MAINE's new rant about Israel PROVES she is liberal crackpot.<br />Israel not only should escalate the attacks, they should go after Iran also.<br />
<br />This has been World War IV since the first World Trade Center Bombing in 1993...time for you loons to realize that.)(For you idiots---World War III was the Cold War, which Reagan won)<br />
<br />As for your moronic stats in your rant above.<br />
<br />30,ooo people were NOT killed in the first few hours of bombing you idiot woman.<br />Only a bitter, angry, stupid and misinformed liberal would say something like that.<br />
<br />You libs throw out numbers that are never right and no one listens anymore.<br />
<br />The mass graves have been reported in the press for years, unless you only listen to AIRHEAD America or CNN.<br />
<br />And by the way....with Bush polling at an average of 40% and rising, you loons better start worrying about 2008...because you blew it this year.<br />
<br />Now, because I have more important things to do than debate with children, I will leave you to your insanity and echo chamber.<br />
<br />Feel free to visit my blog and learn the truth any time!<br />

<br />WWIII was the Cold War? Do you even know what 'Cold War' means idiot MTI? Oh my Pinto Horse...you sure are stupid.<br />
<br />30,000 were killed BECAUSE YOUR PRESIDENT SAID THAT NUMBER.....NOT ME PAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />Again, watching Fox News is making you stupid! Your president also said:<br />
<br />"We have no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with the September the 11th"<br />
<br />And about Osama:<br />
<br />"I don't know where he is. I don't spend much time on him."<br />
<br />And this about Osama:<br />
<br />"Wanted Dead or Alive" (but he didn't mean it...much better to have Osama as the Boogeyman even though he's dead and has been for years now...hence...audiotapes of 'his voice' and no updated pictures!)<br />Thu Jul 13, 06:33:00 PM 2006<br />

<br />
<br />Only 1400???<br />
<br />Wow... you're a god!!!<br />
<br />Someday when I become a flaming loon lib I want that few people seeing my blog.<br />
<br />First, and for the last comment to you <strong>ever</strong>, PRESIDENT Bush said a <strong>TOTAL</strong> of 30,000 dead, <strong>not</strong> in the first few hours as you stated. Once again you blather about crap you know nothing about.<br />
<br />I don't have to say a thing to you anymore, and will not. You have taken up enough of my time. But thanks for the exchange, should look good on my blog that has had thousands of normal people view it in the last 6 months.<br />
<br />Your rant here proved everything I have said about you angry bitter and INSANE loons.<br />
<br />I touched a nerve in you deep down, your screaming at me in caps proves that. That little voice in your head keeps repeating to you...<br />
<br />My sanity is going away....<br />
<br />My sanity is gooooooiiiinnnn away....<br />
<br />Good luck in liberal hell!<br />
<br />It's been fun!<br />
<br />Bye Bye now!<br />

<br />I have not gone back to the site to see the response because I could care less now. They proved my points for me.<br />
<br />No matter how you try and stay calm and aboved the fray with these people on the liberal web sites THEY always get offensive in as many ways as possible.<br />
<br />In Matworld people like KAY IN MAINE are prevented from ever teaching, raising kids or voting. They are DANGEROUS to America and our safety. They are also dragging the Democrat party down the tubes, no matter what happens in November or 2008.<br />
<br />The NUTroots on the Internet are a disease sweeping the political debate in this country into the gutter. They cannot have a conversation without cursing and personal name calling. They have no sense of shame nor of reality. They are afraid because they see their liberal world slipping away into the dustbin of history.<br />
<br />As a friend of mine wrote me when she saw just PART of this exhange:<br />
<br />
<em>âThey really are crazy. And such HATRED! People have different views, always have, always will...but their pure hatred for those who don't have the same opinions is psychotic!â</em>
<br />
<br />
<br />Another person in the Redstate of North Carolina emailed me:<br />
<br />
<em>âEnjoyed reading your blog. I think that blogger "Kay in Maine" sounds a little bitter, however. Isn't interesting how the "progressive" Dems seem to always sink into hateful rhetoric whenever their position is challenged? But at least she included her photo in her entry--she must be breathtaking as she flips her hair back while climbing into her soybean-powered vehicle to a short trip to Starbucks.â</em>
<br />
<br />
<br />Yet another fan of my blog wrote me:<br />
<br />
<em>âPeople like this woman are a WASTE OF TIME. the blog is their hobby, their chance for unrestricted venting with little or no thought of legit discourse. it's all about the emotion, self-validation, so don't waste YOUR time...â</em>
<br />
<br />And I wonât from now on.<br />
<br />Just believe me when I tell you this is just a tiny sample of what the liberals are like today.<br />
<br />Time for us to make sure they never get back in power.<br />

<br />1) <strong>Bush never said 30,000 died in the initial attack-- </strong>
