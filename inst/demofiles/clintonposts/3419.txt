<br />          G.O.P. Deserts One of Its Own for Lieberman<br />
<br />
<br />With many top and influential Republicans supporting the re-election of Connecticut Senator Joe Lieberman, running as an independent against Democratic candidate Ned Lamont, it behooves Democratic leaders to wake up and give strong support to Mr. Lamont. Republicans, from the President on down, have  abandoned the Republican candidate, Alan Schlesinger.<br />
<br />So the Democrats have, in effect, a race against Mr. Lieberman as the Republican candidate. While there has been on site support by John Edwaeds, endorsement by Howard Dean, Russ Feingold and others,  and some financial support from Senators Clinton and Kerry, much more needs to be done. We need to have campaign appearances by Democratic big guns, expert consulting, and continuing strong endorsements.<br />
<br />This is a fight against Republicans and the Democrats must play to win. Some may fear the Republican plans to use Lamont as evidence of the dangerous leftward drift of the Democratic party, but, really, can they convince anyone that Ned Lamont (who comes across like a high school chess coacg) is a wild-eyed extremist?</div>
