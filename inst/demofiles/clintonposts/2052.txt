<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/24/AR2006052402433.html">What's Really Important!</a> To George Will, being an American voter means understanding political discourse, especially that of the pallorous, be-spectacled white men living in the swamp-land of Washington DC. Yes, he and others writing for the Washington Post are the ones who will set the agenda of important issues for all people. Just this week, David Broder told us that Hillary's sex life was more important politically than her energy policy. And who are we to argue?<br />
<br />The white, English-only population was knocked for a loop in the past month when our Spanish-speaking future citizenry rose up and took to the streets to tell us they love America just as much as the longer-established immigrants. It was a political movement that really got going on Spanish-speaking radio stations, and it was one of the most impressive set of political demonstrations this country has seen in years.<br />
<br />The main stream media had to play catch up, being totally ignorant of what happens on Spanish radio. It just wasn't on their radar, and it probably would have remained a complete surprise if the demonstrations weren't going to mess up traffic.<br />
<br />In other words, real politics were happening, with real consequences for real people, and we were almost completely ignorant of it. How dare those people try to tell us what's important to this country! That's what George Will is saying. He'll tell us what matters, thank you very much.  And, to George, if it doesn't happen in English on MSM outlets, it must not matter.  <br />
<br />That he has no idea that his arguments are blatantly racist is appalling.<br />
