<div>Help!! Hillary Clinton is moving so fast to the right she is having fainting spells. I hope the republicans and the sensible people will remember the extreme positions that are the real Hillary.<br />Did you see Bill Clinton promoting his wife no end on TV this week? They have the whole thing planned out. <br />But if the people remember .....<br />Hillary believes that government programs are better for children than family.<br />She believes that a government run healthcare system is the answer to all of America's healthcare problems.<br />She believes that the baby in the womb is not a life and the women should be free to choose to kill the child.<br />Hillary hates the military and when her decent husband was in the whitehouse and she had some power she would actually undermine generals and other military personal just to cut funding so she can spend it on other non-military stuff. What in the world does a communist sympathizer know about this stuff? Can you imagine her as commander in chief? <br />She is such a liar and pretender that she has the whole of New York fooled but can she fool the red states ?  Not if the smart people realize she is lying and pretending to act out what she does not believe to get elected to the highest office in the USA. <br />The mainline press is behind her so they will not ask her the embarrassing questions in the 2006. So that she will be safely  re-elected to the senate from New York and then she can lie her way to the presidency. I really hope Rudy Giuliani runs against her in 2006 making sure she cannot run in 2008. Then a conservative republican like George Allen wins in 2008 and make Rudy the defense or Secretary of State. <br />But my blog is just a BEWARE OF HILLARY CLINTON!!!</div>
