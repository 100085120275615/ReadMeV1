<p>As a HostingCon media sponsor for the second year in a row, the team from TechPad Agency (experts and advocates of <a href="http://www.cheaphostingdirectory.com">hosting</a>) has seen some dramatic changes from last year&#8217;s event to this year&#8217;s: change of venue, more speakers, more exhibitors, and cosolidation in the industry. Here are the top 5 things I learned at HostingCon 2006:</p>
	<p>1. <strong>HostingCon has become the must-attend annual event for the web hosting industry.</strong> Last year we spent much of our time prior to the show explaining what HostingCon was to our web hosting clients. This year we spent most of our time discussing when and where we would meet them at the show. In discussions with other exhibitors and attendees, I heard over and over again, &#8220;There&#8217;s no other show that targets the web hosting industry&#8221;.</p>
	<p>2. <strong>HostingCon doubled in size from last year.</strong> Last year, as a sponsor for a brand new trade show, we were concerned about whether or not anyone would show up - fortunately they did. This year we wondered if the attendees from Chicago would still come to the show in Las Vegas. Wow did they come! The show attendance was over 1,100 - with many attendees signing up in the last few weeks before the show. I have calculated that if HostingCon keeps doubling every year, by the year 2020 it will reach over 18,000,000 attendees!</p>
	<p>3. <strong>Four large-company web hosting CEOs can deliver a huge amount of valuable information in about 40 minutes. </strong>The keynote panel on day 2 (Lessons from the Trenches) which was moderated by David Snead, Attorney, W. David Snead, P.C. and featured:<br />
   Jeffrey Stibel, President and CEO, <a href="http://www.web.com">Web.com</a><br />
   Lou Honick, CEO, <a href="http://www.hostmysite.com">HostMySite.com</a><br />
   Ian Andrusyk, President and CEO, <a href="http://www.fastervers.net.com">FastServers.net</a><br />
   Chris Faulkner, President and CEO, <a href="http://www.cihost.com">C I Host</a><br />
was a fascinating discussion which ran the gamut from dedicated servers to pricing and commoditization to customer acquisition, to finding and training good people. This was truly the essence of group learning in a conference setting.</p>
	<p>4. <strong>Customer acquisition costs are still rising, while hosting company valuations have plateaued.</strong> Multiple web hosting professionals including Matt Heaton, President and CEO, at <a href="http://www.bluehost.com">BlueHost</a> and Joe Bardenheier, VP Corporate Development, <a href="http://www.enduranceinternational.com/acquisitions/index.bml">Endurance International Group, Inc.</a> have confirmed empirically that the cost of gaining new customers (whether organically or through acquisiton continues to rise. Unfortunately, on the buy side, Hillary Stiff, Managing Director, <a href="http://www.chevalcap.com">Cheval Capital, Inc.</a> revealed in her discussion on mergers and acquisitions in the web hosting industry that hosting companies are currently seling for around 1X annual revenues. </p>
	<p>5. <strong>Web hosting leaders are bullish on account growth over the next few years. </strong>I estimate that I personally spoke with over 400 attendees at this year&#8217;s HostingCon. Every single one was bullish on the growth prospects for web hosting in the near term. Most companies are seeking creative ways to grow both their account sign ups and also revenues (ARPU) for existing customers. Few are looking for an exit strategy.</p>
