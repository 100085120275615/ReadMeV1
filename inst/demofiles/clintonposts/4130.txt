<p>So, during the lunch hour I was&nbsp;at my desk, talking briefly to Hillary on MSN in Saskatoon, helping her with a thing or two. Then Johanna (From Switzerland) clicks in and asks me about her pictures. Next Lauralea come on with some information I has asked her about earlier.</p>
<p>And I multitasked, talking with the three at the same time.</p>
<p>A few moments later and I saw Thomas click in, then Micah did too. So I invited the whole clan to talk in the same conversation.</p>
<p>There we were, six of us talking at each other again, just like old times.</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>We talked about a few things, then we had to start going our own ways again.</p>
<p>It was nice to be a family in the same room again, if only virtually.</p>
