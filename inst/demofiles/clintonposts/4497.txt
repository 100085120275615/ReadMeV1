<p>Hillary Clinton <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/nyregion/23challenger.html?hp&ex=1156392000&en=b92c4bdb6d28f19a&ei=5094&partner=homepage">has a challenger</a> from the left in New York, but he's not going to get any significant traction and Sen. Clinton will coast to re-election. The story about the Lamont candidacy that the MSM refuses to tell is that the frustration with Lieberman is not just focused on his hawkishness in Iraq (just today he said it was still the right vote to make, a position increasingly lacking among both Dems and Republicans), but because Joe Lieberman makes a habit out of pissing on Democrats. There are many Democrats whose positions on Iraq are atrocious, but they don't make a living out of jumping to the nearest microphone and, Jeff Jarvis style, regaling the press with how they're not like the rest of <i>those</i> Democratic loons.</p>

<p>For all her faults on the Iraq war, Sen. Clinton is pretty solid on every other issue and makes a point to be a good Democrat. As <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/">Ezra Klein</a> has pointed out, I do wish she made better use of the unique bully pulpit she has to present the Democratic response in the press (the press may yawn for a Harry Reid press conference, but they will cover the most famous senator in America), but she certainly has not badmouthed her party at any given moment. That's also why many in the "netroots" need to take their head out of the sand with regards to her shot at the nomination. Among normal every day people who happen to be Democrats, Sen. Clinton <a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1229053,00.html">is a well-known and well-liked figure</a>. She was first lady for eight years - that is an advantage that <em>not a single</em> likely candidate in either party has.</p>

<p>Count her out at your own peril.</p>
