<p>Now that old friend Joe Lieberman is off running an independent campaign, Hillary <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,210519,00.html">has a new friend </a>in Connecticut, leftist Democratic Senate candidate Ned Lamont.  Hillary had Lamont over for coffee on Friday, where they discussed campaign strategy and talked about her hosting a fundraiser on his behalf.  </p>
	<p>In describing the &#8220;great&#8221; meeting between the two at Hillary&#8217;s Chappaqua home, her advisor Howard Wolfson took a swipe at Lieberman, saying that &#8220;Senator Clinton thinks Ned Lamont did a fabulous job in Connecticut.&#8221;  Wolfson also said that Lamont and Mrs. Clinton &#8220;talked about what Mr. Lamont can expect from the George Bush-Karl Rove attack machine,&#8221; because &#8220;Republicans were invested in defeating him.&#8221;  Hillary even went so far as to lend Wolfson out to Lamont&#8217;s campaign as an advisor.  He said that Hillary &#8220;wanted me to do it,&#8221; because &#8220;[i]t's vitally important that we elect a Democrat to that seat,&#8221; another dig at Lieberman.</p>
	<p>How Hillary helps the two campaigns remains in question.  Lamont&#8217;s campaign took her cash ($5,000 from HILLPAC) and his campaign manager thought the meeting will be &#8220;helpful to Ned's election in November.&#8221;  Meanwhile, Lieberman spokesman Dan Gerstein brushed of Hillary&#8217;s public support for Lamont, saying that &#8220;If endorsements meant anything, Joe Lieberman would have won the primary running away.&#8221;</p>
	<p>Gerstein also noted that &#8220;Senator Clinton's position on Iraq is far closer to Joe Lieberman's than it is to Ned Lamont's.&#8221;  Which brings us to how Hillary&#8217;s endorsement affects her campaign, after all, whatever she does is all about her anyway.  Maybe Hillary thinks that by cozying up to Lamont and making not-so-subtle slams of Lieberman, antiwar voters in New York will think more of her when the September 12th Democratic primary rolls around.</p>
