<em>LET THE (GOP) FIGHTS BEGIN<br />
</em>
<br />Ex-Massachusetts Gov. William Weld last week announced his intent to seek the GOP gubernatorial nomination. Earlier in the week, millionaire Tom Golisano â despite three failed attempts as an independent â also declared his interest in the GOP nod.<br />
<br />Meanwhile, Jeanine Pirro's stumbling "Page 10" campaign kickoff gave renewed hope to lawyer Ed Cox and ex-Yonkers Mayor John Spencer, who earlier had declared for the U.S. Senate.<br />
<br />Let 1,000 flowers bloom, we say. Well-fought primaries don't have to be destructive â indeed, they can energize voters for the general election. But will the party agree?<br />
<br />After Pirro's declaration, GOP Chairman Stephen Minarik immediately pronounced her the "best candidate." Spencer complained, "[As] state chairman, you're not allowed to say: 'I favor so-and-so.' What kind of process is that?"<br />
<br />For the GOP, that's business as usual. Secretary of State Randy Daniels â an African-American who has never previously run for office â also is interested in the GOP gubernatorial nomination. Dismissing the idea, Minarik said, "He has less than 5 percent name recognition . . . and he doesn't have any money." So why not encourage Daniels to campaign, promote himself and the party? What's the harm? Instead, Minarik was long pushing for Weld, who â despite his success in Massachusetts â has little "name recognition" with New Yorkers.<br />
<br />This is the legacy of George Pataki's GOP: Discourage outsiders, as the party disintegrates.<br />
<br />Since Al D'Amato upset Sen. Jacob Javits in 1980, there have been only two GOP statewide primaries â and none since 1994, when Pataki beat former party chairman Richard Rosenbaum. Perhaps not coincidentally, Pataki is the GOP's only statewide success since '94.<br />
<br />In 2000, it took a court fight for Sen. John McCain to get on the state presidential-primary ballot. In 2004, little-known lawyer Michael Benjamin sought the party nomination against Chuck Schumer: Despite raising a million dollars, visiting all counties and earning endorsements from several county chairmen, Benjamin was pushed aside by Minarik's predecessor. Why? So the party could anoint Assemblyman Howard Mills â who produced the worst statewide defeat in history. For playing ball, Mills got the sinecure of state insurance superintendent â for which he had zero qualifications. The payday for the party's 2002 joke AG candidate, Dora Irizarry, was a federal judgeship â despite an American Bar Association "unqualified" rating.<br />
<br />So why not an honest primary? Let Daniels, Golisano, Weld and whomever else run for governor. Ditto, attorney general or comptroller. Who knows? Perhaps the winners of those contests will be in much better fighting shape to take on Hillary Clinton, Eliot Spitzer, Alan Hevesi, et. al.<br />
<br />They could hardly do worse than the party's last few go-rounds.</div>
