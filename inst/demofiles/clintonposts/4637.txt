<p>Joe Lieberman is whistling a new tune and it&#8217;s not the classic &#8220;Flip, Flop and Fly.&#8221; Instead it&#8217;s his own version of Flip, Flop and Lieberman&#8230; </p>
	<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060826/ap_on_el_se/connecticut_senate">Joe Lieberman</a>, the three-term Democrat whose independent campaign for re-election is being seen as a referendum on the Iraq war, said Friday he would consider taking a look at a fellow lawmaker&#8217;s proposal for a timeline for troop withdrawals. </p>
	<p>The proposal was floated by Republican Rep. Chris Shays, another Connecticut politician facing a tough re-election battle with an anti-war candidate. Shays has long been a supporter of the war and previously opposed withdrawal timetables.</p>
	<p>&#8220;It seems to me that Chris is saying, maybe we ought to set some goals for when we want to get out, and I&#8217;d like to see what he has in mind before I comment on it,&#8221; Lieberman said while campaigning in New Haven.</p>
	<p>&#8220;As I&#8217;ve said to you over and over again, the sooner we get out of Iraq, the better it&#8217;s going to be for the Iraqis and us, but if we leave too soon for reasons of American politics, it&#8217;s going to be disaster for the Iraqis and for us,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
	<p>With Hillary <a href="http://blog.thedemocraticdaily.com/wp-trackback.php?p=3991">ponying up</a> to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/26/nyregion/26lieberman.html?_r=1&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;adxnnlx=1156644139-Ir3kHa5jq9FpnSFqqey0Kw">support Lamont</a> yesterday, and then saying that she thinks  âon nearly every issue we are closely aligned,â later in the day, that&#8217;s got to sting a little for old Joe, who had Hill&#8217;s support during the primary. To many Joe&#8217;s <a href="http://www.themoderatevoice.com/posts/1156574161.shtml">not looking so Independent</a> these days. </p>
	<p><em>This latest, if it&#8217;s good <a href="http://blog.thedemocraticdaily.com/wp-trackback.php?p=3990">for a republican</a>, it may be good for me, is a big slap in the fact to the party he abandoned</em>.
