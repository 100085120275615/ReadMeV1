<span>Page Six</span> is reporting that the producers of the new Monica Crowley/Ron Reagan talker on MSNBC were unaware of Crowley's habit of referring to NY Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton as "<a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/twocities/terms/charanal_2.html">Madame DeFarge</a>" on her WABC Radio show until they invited the senator to appear on the MSNBC program's premiere. "The senator will not be available now or in the foreseeable future," they were quickly informed by the former First Lady's staff. "How about when hell freezes over?" asks <span>Page Six</span>.</p>
