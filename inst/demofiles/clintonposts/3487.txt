<div>Raise your hand if you know who James Frey is. (Good.)<br />
<br />Raise your hand again if you believe that Frey is a blight on the literary community. (That should be all of you.)<br />
<br />And finally, raise your hand and slap yourself a half-dozen times if you believe that anything involving Frey, his nearly wholly fabricated memoir and an Oprah sanctions are more important than world peace, or, ya know, any other news story that broke yesterday.<br />
<br />Last night, as your Humble Correspondent cleaned the crib in anticipation of a visit from the betrothed, I flipped on Anderson Cooper 360 on CNN. You know Anderson -- the silver-haired, globetrotting, Senator smacking, It Boy who usurped Aaron Brown for CNN's main anchor spot. Last scene being swept up by a hurricane while telling Mary Landrieu she didn't know her ass from her elbow. Or something.<br />
<br />Anyway, as Hamas took a majority in the Palestinian government and myriad other news stories scrolled by on CNN's news ticker the It Boy spent an entire hour dedicated to: Oprah. Frey. Frey lying. Oprah slapping Frey around, nearly literally. Oprah. Frey. Frey lying. Oprah slapping Frey around, nearly literally. Oprah. Frey. Frey lying. Oprah slapping Frey around, nearly literally...<br />
<br />You get it. CNN covering someone <em>else</em>'s talk show segment like it is the Watergate hearings. The title of this entry isn't even a joke -- it was the title of an entire 15 minute segment of last night's show.<br />
<br />To be sure, I am guilty: Like a great train wreck or an episode of Real World/Road Rules Gauntlet on MTV, I could not look away or flip the channel. But what was I going to do? Check in with Brit Hume on Fox News?<br />
<br />Now your HC has written in this same hole before about the whole Oprah/Frey kerfuffle...And gave serious props to Oprah for her unparalleled grip on America. And I realize, that, you know, the nature of what Oprah did yesterday was both out of character and terrific theatre.<br />
<br />BUT FOR GOD'S SAKE!<br />
<br />Here we have an election in the Middle East that could, legitamately, have ripple effects for decades. We have the Israelis refusing to speak to the Palestinian government. We have <em>news</em>.<br />
<br />To paraphrase a certain It Boy anchor when he spoke to Marry Landrieu after Katrina hit, Where is the outrage?!?!<br />
<br />***<br />
<br />Now, on to some examples of quality journalism.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/26/AR2006012602013.html">Here is the delightfully earnest style critic</a> for the Washington Post taking a young New Jerseyan to task for wearing a skirt. True, said Young New Jerseyan is a man, a fairly large high school student, and it may seem like a slam dunk that such a person would not be, ah, best accentuated in a skirt. But the author takes up the occasion as an opportunity to explain why pants are great <em>for everybody</em>. She cites Hillary Clinton, whom, she notes, looks awful in a skirt. Also, Laura Bush often finds pants easier to use. Really.<br />
