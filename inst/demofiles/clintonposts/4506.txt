<p>His latest (dare I hope it will be his last?) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/30/opinion/30safire.html">Predictions For 2006</a> column is such a worthless piece of junk, shilling for the conservative agenga he has shamelessly promoted for all these years, while pretending to be an open-minded critic.</p>

<p>Seriously, look at the issues he's raised and the manner in which he treats them.  (to say nothing of his actual predictions, which are beyond a joke)<br />
</p>
<p>The first 2 are fairly straightforward: troop levels are a constant question (though Saffire probably should have included an option for increased troop levels, but he wants to promote the idea that troops will be coming home soon) and there's certainly a possibility of a change in leadership of the House, either through dissatisfaction in the GOP or a Dem win.</p>

<p>Question 3 shows bias, labeling <i>North Country</i> as "anti-sexist", in order to poke Hollywood for rewarding those dirty, dirty liberals.</p>

<p>Question 4: assumes Alito is confirmed, which is a hell of an if these days, but a GOP desire.</p>

<p>Question 5: makes a comment about the author on the feminist book only.</p>

<p>Question 6 & 7: played straight.</p>

<p>Question 8: only addresses issues from the Clinton administration.  Frame of the question suggests that the media will only ignore stuff from the Dems, promoting that hoary old saw of the liberal media.</p>

<p>Question 9: "finally reflects"?  yeah, whatever.</p>

<p>Question 10: These are the only options for 2006?  How about civil war?  Wait, that wouldn't be optimistic.  </p>

<p>Question 11: This assumes that this year's issues won't be the same as the last election and that gay marriage won't be used as a wedge issue.  But I'll give him this one, as I'm assuming Saffire meant to ask what the new issue would be.</p>

<p>Question 12: Boy, not really thinking outside the box too much, least on the dem side of things.  This is pretty much the usual suspects, except for John Edwards.  The GOP choices aren't new names either, but it would be surprising for them to get through the primaries.  Probably should have included at least one way out on the religious right candidate, but Saffire doesn't want to scare anyone by ackowleging that clowns like Coburn, Cornyn, Santorum are in control of the GOP.</p>

<p>Question 13: Edwards is missing from this list too for the Dems.  How the hell can he be off both lists?  I'm also wondering how Hillary gets on both lists.</p>

<p>Question 14:  The real kicker.  Notice anyone missing here?  Yeah, that's right, ol' Tricky Dick didn't make the cut.  He should have been on there, in place of Eisenhower or Truman.  What's particularly embarrassing about this question is A) it assumes Bush's popularity will continue to rise, and B) Saffire's answer.  He's equating W with Truman!!!  Mr. Saffire, I've studied Harry Truman.  Harry Truman was a hero of mine.  George W. Bush is no Harry Truman.</p>

<p>Hackery from William Saffire, again.  Lest anyone think this was a mistake, this man is a recognized expert in language usage.  These options were not set up haphazardly, it was all intentional pimping of his chosen path: the GOP rules!  All Hail King George II!<br />
