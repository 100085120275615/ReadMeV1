<br />I usually laugh at liberals and their socialist fatwahs against America. Media bias? It's just par for the course. But once in awhile, the mainstream media applies such a double standard that I seriously, and I mean SERIOUSLY, wonder whether there is some sort of socialist conspiracy going on underneath our noses.<br />
<br />Today was one of those days. If you haven't heard (and you probably didn't), Hillary Clinton held a birthday party for 88-year-old Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) in the one-time house of <em>Frederick Douglass</em>. And why is that such a big deal? Well, Senator Byrd was a<em> Ku Klux Klan member</em> during the 1940s. But he was more than your average member, he was elected to the office of Kleagle, and then elevated to the office of Grand Cyclops in that venerable organization. What has he done since? He <em>filibustered</em> by speaking for hours on end when the Senate debated the 1964 Civil Rights Act that, despite his (and other Democrats') efforts, eventually passed with wide Republican support. And a few years back, he noted during a TV interview that he's seen a lot of "white niggers" during his time.<br />
<br />No big deal, right? Well, it was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trent_Lott">national crisis</a> when Trent Lott, during a birthday party, said that things would have been better had Strom Thurmond been elected President. As you may recall, Strom Thurmond (like Byrd) was a segregationist. Based on this offhand remark alone, made while singing the praises of an equally old Strom Thurmond, the media immediately jumped to the conclusion that Lott wished that segregation would have continued. They demanded that he apologize, on non-segregation-supporting Black Entertainment Television, and he was eventually forced to resign his leadership position in the Senate (in a fit of Republican weakness).<br />
<br />There is a virtual silence in the media today about the Byrd b-day affair at Douglass' house. Objectively speaking, the decision to hold this party at that location was much, much more offensive than Trent Lott's comment ever could be. Not only was Byrd a former segregationist, he was a Klan member and a strident opponent of civil rights. As someone who isn't as "race conscious" as most liberals, even I can see how off-color it is to defile Douglass' house with the presence of such a man.<br />
<br />So what is the <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--clinton-pirro1115nov15,0,4921143.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork">non-silent media</a> saying? They're presenting this as an "attack" by Jeanine Pirro, Clinton's future opponent for her annointed NY Senate seat. What a load of s%#@!!!!</div>
