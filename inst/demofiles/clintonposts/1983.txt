<br />I'm not Hillary's biggest fan, but if she runs in the 2008 election I'll damn well be voting for her because it is high time this uptight, Evangelical, frigid nation needs a woman for president. And honestly, more so than my Kerry vote last election, my politics are slightly more on par with Hillary's.<br />
<br />So the spunky "Stand by your felatio receiving man" Hillary takes on evil incarnate, Donald "The war is just going smashingly bitches" Rumsfeld and frankly humiliates the man on live TV.<br />
<br />Here's my thing with Rumsfeld, sure he's been planning total destruction of the world for the last twenty years in the background of presidential cabinets and advisory positions, but damn is that man fucking funny. Remove the potential evil bile that creeps through his veins instead of blood and you've got the next Dave Chapelle for the over fifty crowd. I love his bravado. I love his condescension. I love how no matter where he is at or who's company he is keeping, he <em>always</em> looks inconvenienced. Like he could be at home playing tin toy soldiers on his twenty square foot mock battlefield, but instead you've got him at some arbitrary Congressional investigation asking him questions about shit you shouldn't even be worried about.<br />
<br />I feel like his face always says, "I've got this shit. You are a total waste of my time."<br />
<br />I bet Donald Rumsfeld constructs elaborate radar contraptioins that shoot beams from the sides of his eyes for all the press agents, reporters, Democrats and general wastes of oxygen. I bet he even fantasizes about a Conservative world where he and the love of his life, Dick Cheney, rule eternally and without mercy.<br />
<br />Rumsfeld needs his own reality show where we can watch him vanquish his morning eggs.<br />
<br />Maybe we can get Rumsfeld and Hillary into some type of governmental Celebrity Death match. I'd pay good money for that.</div>
