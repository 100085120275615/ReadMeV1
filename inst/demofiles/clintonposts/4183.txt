<p>In 2008, Nevada will hold a Democratic presidential caucus one week after Iowa, and a day before New Hampshire.  (That makes us 2nd.)  This is <b>huge</b> for us, and I'm even more delighted that the first quote in the article comes from Dina Titus, aka the next governor of the state of Nevada.</p>
<p>What remains to be seen is how, exactly, Hillary, Biden, Feingold and Edwards will campaign in a state that has two large population centers, whose main revenues come from gaming and mining, and that voted for GWB in 2004 (narrowly.)  What is obvious is that this puts Nevada into play in 2008.  I'm not sure what good our measly electoral college votes would do, but it's exciting to think that I might be able to volunteer for Feingold's campaign while it matters.</p>
<p>The major downside?  Too much Bill Richardson.  I can see it coming.</p>
