<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard how a <strong>big shot</strong> got there- he kept being a <strong>little shot</strong> every time he could. Sometimes though we get shot in the way to trying to attain something. There&#8217;s another addage that fits here as well-<strong> live by the sword</strong> <strong>die by the sword</strong>. I think we&#8217;re seeing Hillary do things now for a pole position two years down the road. Will it come back to bite her or benefit her? <a id="more-48"></a></p>

<p><strong>Bill and Hillary</strong> Clinton are doing the political good guy- bad guy act in Connecticut. Bill goes in to support Joe Lieberman,Â and now <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/08/25/D8JNM09G0.html">Hillary is lending her political clout to Ned Lamont</a>. Clout means moral support, host a fundraiser, and a trusted political advisor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious that all of this is being orchestrated like a savvy Enron-type corporation. Give to both campaigns and that way you can&#8217;t lose. However, in this case Hillary could lose in the long term. Memories and 2008 aren&#8217;t that far away. It&#8217;s obvious to me that Hillary is sending a signal to the far left of her party. Otherwise, she could do this behind scene and accomplish just as much.</p>
<p>I think she is also sending a message about being <b>LOYAL</b> to the party- to her! Stray from the fold and you&#8217;re outta the loop. Message received. Now, what message will the electorate sned to her both in &#8216;06 and in &#8216;08?
