<p>In the wake of Jeanine Pirro's awkward withdrawal from the race, many assumed that Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's only re-election challenge would be trying to beat the New York blowout record set by Sen. Chuck Schumer in 2004. But the latest poll by John Zogby indicates that Hillary suddenly has a food fight on her hands.</p>

<p>In his first poll after Pirro dropped out on Jan. 13, Zogby had Hillary ahead of GOP challenger John Spencer by 61 percent to 31 percent. But in his most recent survey, conducted March 27, her margin had fallen to 54-33.</p>

<p>Hillary's drop did not reflect any aggressive paid media push by Spencer. He has yet to run his first ad. Rather, Hillary is losing the key contest of Hillary vs. Hillary - her negatives are rising.</p>

<p>In New York City, she dropped from a 68-19 lead to 62-25. In the suburbs, she fell from 55-36 to 48-41. Upstate, her edge went from 57-38 to 43-42.</p>

<p>Suddenly, it's a race.</p>

<p>Animating Hillary's drop are losses on all ends of the political spectrum. She's down by six points among Democrats, and by 12 with Republcians. But her key falloff is among independents - from 64 percent to 49 percent.</p>

<p>What's the problem? Some on the left may find her too pro-war, while others may be reacting to her newly prominent stridency as a critic of the Bush administraion. After six years of studied moderation and respectful silence, the Hillary Clinton who poured coffee for her fellow senators is now yielding the spotlight to the loud, partisan critic.</p>

<p>And her candidacy for president may be eroding her support in New York. The more visible she is on the national stage and the more she seems to be warming up for a run in 2008,</p>
