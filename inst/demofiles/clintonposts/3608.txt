<div>The Republican victory that occurred on election night was absolutely unbelievable. No one, not even the most hard-core Republicans, were predicting a victory of that magnitude. The GOP victory was total and complete. Let's review the GOP victories:
<br />
<br />- Bush received a majority of the popular vote, which nails the coffin on the "Bush isn't legitimate" crowd forever.
<br />
<br />- The Republicans gained 4 Senate seats and increased their Senate majority from 51 to 55 GOP Senators. This is a solid Senate majority that will allow Bush to do at least one politically influential task in the next term: pass several GOP Supreme Court Appointments. Bush will re-shape the top courts, especially the Supreme Court, in a way that will last for the next 30 years.
<br />
<br />- The Republicans increased their majority in the House of Representatives from 227 to a projected 232. This new House majority surpasses the GOP House majority that existed after the GOP blowout election of 1994 (in that year, the GOP won 230 seats). The GOP has controlled the House for the past 10 years and the 2004 victory extends this political lease until the end of the decade.
<br />
<br />- Bush won Florida and Ohio convincingly, with no recounts. Bush grabbed two blue states that Gore won in 2000 (Iowa and New Mexico) and came close in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Michigan, and Wisconsin. John Kerry only turned one state from red to blue, and that was New Hampshire.
<br />
<br />- Minority Leader Tom Daschle lost in South Dakota. This loss is significant because it sends a huge message to other Senate Democrats from Red States about the political costs they face if they obstruct Bush on federal judges and legislation like Daschle did.
<br />
<br />- Bush grabbed a greater number of popular votes than Ronald Reagan did in 1984. While it is true that the population is bigger in 2004 than it was in 1984, the symbolism of Bush achieving the most total popular votes ever has a huge political impact in terms of shaping a second term mandate.
<br />
<br />- Bush led the Republicans to a historic victory in the 2002 midterm, and he did it again in 2004. Republicans control the Presidency, the House of Representatives, and the Senate by comfortable margins. Republicans will solidify their control of the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary in the next 4 years. This has huge ramifications for the future in terms of setting the agenda for the next decade.
<br />
<br />- Gay marriage bans passed in all 11 states where it was on the ballot, by huge margins in each state (even in blue Oregon). Bill Clinton had urged John Kerry and the Democrats to support all of the gay marriage bans in order to be competitive in the red states. This was excellent political advise from one of the true Jedi Masters of American Politics. John Kerry dismissed this advice by stating he would never do that. This is why Kerry was Dukakis II who, much like his home-state predecessor, completely failed when it came to articulating the values of Middle America. Bill Clinton won in 1992 and 1996 because he "got it" when it came to the values issues in the campaign. John Kerry followed in the footsteps of McGovern, Mondale, Dukakis, and Gore in terms of representing the secular values of Hollywood and New York to the exclusion of the red "flyover country". There is a message for the Democrats in 2008: No Northeastern Liberals Need Apply for the Job of President. Hillary Clinton is smoking crack if she thinks she is going to crack the Red State Electoral Math in the next election.
<br />
<br />- In today's Washington Times, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Lesbian and Gay Rights Project said the election results "ended nothing".  This is total bullshit.  Let's review how the 11 states that had gay marriage bans on the ballot supported the issue:
<br />
<br />1) Arkansas: 74%  (Bill Clinton's home state...now a Red State)
<br />2) Georgia: 77% (Red State)
<br />3) Kentucky: 75% (Red State)
<br />4) Michigan: 59% (This is a Blue state in 2000, 2002, and 2004)
<br />5) Mississippi: 86% (Red State)
<br />6) Montana: 66% (Montana elected a Democratic Governor in 2004, it is a red state)
<br />7) North Dakota: 73% (Red State)
<br />8) Ohio: 62% (This was the key swing state of 2004...Red State)
<br />9) Oklahoma: 76% (No surprise here...Red State)
<br />10) Oregon: 57% (Among the Bluest of the Blue States...)
<br />11) Utah: 66% (No surprise here...)
<br />
<br />Couple these victories with the overwhelming support for a gay marriage ban in Missouri in the August primaries, and you have a pretty convincing case that the American public, be it red or blue, north or south, do not want gay marriage.  Period.  The ACLU can try to beat this dead horse in future elections.  And if they do, expect more Democratic shutouts in the elections.  This is why Democrats lose.  They are consistently on the wrong side of values questions (the "80/20" issues) where 80% of the American public stand (don't burn the U.S. flag, keep "Under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance, partial birth abortion ban, no gay marriage).  The liberals just don't get it.  So, we have GOP election blowouts (1972, 1980, 1984, 1994, 2002, 2004) that keep reinforcing the same message to the hard-core liberal extremists that try to impose their more extreme social values on Middle America time after time.
