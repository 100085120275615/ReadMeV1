<p>I do believe that Kos claimed that he did not give out orders to other bloggers via the Town Hall email list when it was exposed, even though the liberal bloggers heeded his calls for silence regarding Jerome Armstrong. Now we've got more evidence of the Unified Message Central Command over at Kos. In order to really take it to Joe Lieberman for running as an Independent, and thereby squashing all hopes the netroots have of winning with Lamont in November, a massive and orchestrated attack has been launched.</p>
<p>As I already wrote earlier, Kos laid down orders for his minions:</p>

<blockquote>Here's what we all need to do the next few days:

<p>1. Push Harry Reid to strip Lieberman of all committee assignments.</p>

<p>2. Let people know what a sore loser Lieberman is.</p>

<p>3. Get all Democrats -- including Bill Clinton -- to publicly back Ned Lamont.</p>

<p>4. Get the Democratic interest groups who backed Lieberman to switch allegiances in the general.</blockquote></p>

<p>Kos posted this <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/8/231459/7695">at 11:15PM EDT</a>. Let's turn to John Aravosis at AMERICAblog, <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2006/08/on-wednesday-call-senate-dems-and.html">at 11:22PM EDT</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Call every single Democratic office in the Senate on Wednesday and demand two things:

<p>1. That the Senator immediately come out in support of the Democratic Senate candidate from Connecticut, Ned Lamont.</p>

<p>2. That Joe Lieberman be immediately kicked out of every single committee seat given to him by the Democratic party. Joe Lieberman is more interested in his own welfare than the welfare of the party. It's time for him to go. And it's time for us to tell the Democratic party that we're going to war over this race.</p>

<p>3. Markos makes a great suggestion. Call the liberal interest groups who supported Lieberman and, now that Lieberman has lost, demand that they support Lamont who likely has a 100% record on most of their issues, and certainly he is better than the Republican candidate. I will be happy to help on this, so please give me feedback about any guff you get from the groups.</blockquote></p>

<p>Then of course one of the most important Lamont blogs, <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/08/08/late-nite-fdl-in-which-we-fucking-won/">Firedoglake at 11:30PM EDT</a>:</p>

<blockquote>Weâre gonna bring the fight to Joe.  In the mean time, hereâs what YOU can do.  Go here and write to Harry Reid.   Now that Joe isnât a Democrat, he needs to be stripped of all his committee memberships.  And remember that the Democratic party has to get behind the winner of the Democratic primary.</blockquote>

<p>The common theme: get Lieberman's committee assignments revoked, call senators to push them to support Lamont, get interest groups backing Lamont. Now the calling of senators to back Lamont after winning the primary is fairly straight forward, as is persuading interest groups to back the primary winner. However, what's with this committee assignment plan? It's not as if AMERICAblog or Firedoglake attributed the idea to Kos, so where did it come from? Do you mean to tell me that each of these bloggers came up with the unprecedented idea to have Lieberman's committee assignments revoked? <em>Sure</em>.</p>

<p>I took Kos for a whirl in my earlier post, now it's Aravosis' turn:</p>

<blockquote>He is a disloyal Republican partisan. He now openly defies the will of the Democratic voters, and would rather risk our party's future, our chance to take back the Congress in the fall, in order to coddle his increasingly-conservative ego.</blockquote>

<p>This is especially funny since the Lamont campaign went against the wishes of pretty much the entire Democratic party - they wanted Joe. Now they claim Lieberman is defying Democratic voters by running as an Independent. How? Because he'll easily beat Lamont with the entire electorate of Connecticut? See, that's all this is about. These people are scared senseless that Lieberman is going to beat their pin-up in November. In fact, they want to suppress democracy in order for their candidate to win. In other words, these people don't want it to be up to the voters of Connecticut to decide who their senator is going to be, they want to be the ones deciding.</p>

<blockquote>Fine, Lieberman wants a fight with Democrats, he's got one.</blockquote>

<p>As opposed to the fight the Freshmaker lodged against the Democrats who stood firmly behind Lieberman in the primary?</p>

<blockquote>Our voice has to be heard, we need to stand for something. Can't we even stand to agree on who won our own elections? Joe Lieberman doesn't respect the voters, and he doesn't respect the decision of the Democratic Party, plain and simple. So he's no longer welcome in the party.</blockquote>

<p>Here you have it folks. Lieberman isn't respecting the voters because he wants to run because he knows that he will win - that the people of Connecticut want him as their senator. The Democratic party did not decide this - Democratic primary voters in Connecticut did, by a whopping 4% margin. The Democratic party had already decided to back Lieberman until the Freshmaker came riding along on the anti-war wave.</p>

<blockquote>If that's what Joe Lieberman and the Democratic Party wants over the next three months, then that's what they're going to get. It's going to be a disaster for the party, and will jeopardize our chances of taking back the Congress. But Joe Lieberman made that decision for all of us. So let the war begin.</blockquote>

<p>Lieberman made the decision? Who's decision was it to run a pin-up single-issue anti-war candidate against Lieberman, against the wishes of virtually the entire Democratic party? You reap what you sow, ladies and gentleman.</p>

<p>I, along with many others, told you that running Lamont against Lieberman was going to be a big mistake because it would split the party and you'd still end up losing. Did you listen? Nope. You didn't respect the wishes of the Democratic party and went ahead with your witch hunt of Lieberman with a phony candidate instead.</p>

<p>This is the worst sort of projection because it's clear for everyone to see that the only reason they are so mad at Lieberman is because they know he will take out Lamont in November, meaning they will have caused a division in the Democratic party for simply their own ideological crusade.</p>

<p>As I said, the only thing Kos and these Lamont bloggers care about is their crusade against the war, and by extension, Lieberman. They didn't give a damn that they would cause huge problems for the Democrats - and that's exactly what they have just accomplished. So what to do? Blame Lieberman!</p>

<p>I can hardly believe the things I am reading here because I voted for the Democratic ticket in 2000 - and I'll be damned if Lieberman wasn't on that ticket. Karl Rove must have concocted DailyKos because the only thing it does is hurt the Democratic party. Our democracy depends on two or more solid political parties, and when these political operative bloggers sabotage the party all the time, it makes our democracy weaker.</p>
