It's no wonder <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=460017">Eugene Kane came flying to Kevin Barrett's defense</a>.  If you read <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/blog/index.aspx?id=84&month=08&amp;year=2006&entry=22367">Kane's latest conspiracy theory</a>, you'll understand why it's so important for him to uphold one's right to blather on and on with little regard for common sense.<br /><br />Nick Schweitzer <a href="http://www.nickschweitzer.net/2006/08/08/NotEverythingIsAConspiracy.aspx">sums it up best</a> with:<br /><br /><blockquote>So according to his theory, one oil company is just kind enough to sabotage<br />its facilities so that all its competitors can make more money from the ensuing<br />rise in gas prices, while it makes less money since it has less oil to<br />sell.  How do you envision this working Eugene?  Did all the big oil<br />execs go to a nice hotel in the Caribbean and draw lots to see who got<br />to take one for the team?<br /><br />I'm guessing that nowhere in the job description for Journal Sentinel Columnist does the line, "Has a strong grasp of common sense" appear does it?</blockquote><br /><br />Kane also makes the claim in his post that...<br /><br /><blockquote>...if we EVER elect a president - and vice president - with such close ties to<br />the oil companies again, the entire country should have its collective head<br />examined.</blockquote><br />Good advice, and something we should take under consideration when casting votes for the likes of Hillary Clinton or Jim Doyle.  After all, lawyers have historically had reputations right up there with big oil executives.
