Now we admit, he's pretty impressive, but we thought you might want to hear from someone else..." </strong><br /></span><strong><br /><span>Fade into headshot of a nobel prize winning economist (gimme a name Readers) looking into the camera... </span></strong><br /><br /><span><strong>"The truth is, this President is damaging Social Security by breaking open Bill Clinton's lock box and using your money to pay for his tax cuts for the wealthy. Privatizing Social Security addresses a crisis that doesn't exist, and in doing it takes the 'security' out of Social Security. Don't buy into this effort to break the promise that each generation of Americans has kept to its children and grandparents for over 60 years." </strong><br /><br /><strong>Fade to black with Caption: "Call your Senators and Congressperson today and ask them to oppose the President's reckless scheme to privatize Social Security."</strong></span></em><br /></em></span>
