<br />On July 30 2001 Hillary's Campaign Treasurer Andrew Grossman, sent this letter response/report to a request by the FEC for more information on Event 39 (the Farewell Gala). July 30, 2001 was two weeks after Hillary, her lawyer David Kendall, Grossman and Bill Clinton were served as co-defendants with the civil complaint for fraud and coercion filed by Paul on June 18, 2001; a demand letter that was hand delivered to Hillary's Senate chambers on July 16, 2001 with a copy of a Federal Election Complaint filed by Paul - all accompanied by checks and invoices to support Paul's claims of more than $1.2 million contributed on Hillary's behalf. This 3rd Fraudulent FEC Report was filed by Grossman with the knowledge and assistance of Hillary, Bill and David Kendall who had begun working on the 300 page response Hillary filed on August 5, 2001 in the civil case.<br />
