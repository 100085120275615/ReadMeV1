<div>Well it is election day in the morning. Today I am going to run, among other things, funny quotes I come across.
<br />
<br />I thought the best one to start the day would be <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20041102/D863DMI81.html">a statement </a>by Kerry on his last day of campaigning:
<br />
<br />"When I turned my boat in Vietnam into an ambush and I went straight into the ambush and overran it, I didn't see George Bush or Dick Cheney at my side," Kerry said. "So I'm not going to take a second seat to anybody in my willingness to be tough to defend the United States of America. I did it when it mattered, and as president I will defend the United States of America with everything I have."
<br />
<br />Didn't Bill Clinton tell this guy to "stop talking about Vietnam?" Heh.

<br />"The kind of political trick that Daschle's lawyers tried works only if it remains an unverified rumor through Election Day, and things don't remain rumors anymore. The new electronic world welcomes you, Senator Daschle--and it says goodbye to you, as well."

<br />The definition of <em>non sequitur</em> can be found <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20041102/D863J0LG1.html">below</a>:
<br />
<br />"Republicans wanted to put challengers in many polling places [in Ohio] because of concerns about fraud with hundreds of thousands of newly registered voters in a state President Bush and Sen. John Kerry both say they need to win. Democrats have accused the GOP of trying to suppress Democratic turnout."
