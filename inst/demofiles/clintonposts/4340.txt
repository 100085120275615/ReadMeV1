<blockquote><strong>Mark Levin</strong> <em>(opening his show, Tuesday, April 25, 2006)</em>: All this talk about press secretaries.  You know, maybe I could be the press secretary to the President. Oh, yes, yes. Iâve got some thoughts on how to proceed here. Letâs give it a try, shall we?<br />
 <br />
<strong>Press Secretary Mark Levin:</strong> Yes sir, you have a question:<br />
 <br />
<strong>WH press corps member #1:</strong> Americans are going to listen what the President had to say today, theyâre going to digest his four-point plan, and the first question's going to be, thatâs fine, what does it mean dollars and cents to me in the near term, this summer when they gas up to go on vacation? So can you give us any indication as to what this will [sic] translates to, in rough dollars and sense?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong> Yes. This four-point plan you talk about is actually a five-point point plan. Thatâs right, my four points and that point on your head. Sit down you big dummy!<br />
 <br />
<!--more--><strong>ML:</strong>  Next question. You sir.<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #2:</strong>  Has the President been briefed at all on the CIAâs firing of Mary McCarthy for allegedly leaking classified information?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Yes. Did she leak to you too? Sit down!<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Next question. You sir.<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #3:</strong>  White House poll says I think president doing (unintelligible)<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  I donât understand what youâre saying. Speak up. Yes, try our language. Go!<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #3:</strong> White House polls says I think President doing these back in many areas<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>   Who are you, Truman Capote?<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #3:</strong>  How would you assess his 1,000 days in office and, also, donât you think that by bringing oil prices down and Osama bin Laden and home on injustice will bring his ratings up?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  What?  Arrest this guy.  Quickly.  How did he get in here?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Next question. You.<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #4:</strong>  On the subject of the ongoing inquiry, the new investigation  into whether or not there may or may not be price gouging by the Attornies General, as directed by the FTC and DOJ, has there been and indication from previous FTC studies in the wake of Katrina or for that matter information that has merely trucked crossed the White House transom that suggests that there has been collusion in the oil industry?<br />
 <br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong> No. We have no information there's been collusion in the oil industry. Not one scintilla of evidence but I do have a new suggestion on how we can get more crude oil. I said it before; nobody listened. We could build a pipeline to Charles Schumerâs hair.<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Next question. You.<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #4:</strong>  With all the initiatives in the Presidentâs four-point plan today and the things that the President is doing in the immediate, ah, just because this has been a lengthy discussion here this morning, what do you say to the guy out in Iowa who is about to go to the gas pumps and see extraordinary prices and thatâs going to affect his budget, should he be expecting what the President unfurled today to have an affect on holding the price where it is, ceasing its rise, or beginning its drop?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Well, thatâs a multi-pronged question and as you know we donât answer multi-pronged questions but I say to the man in Iowa what I say to all of our friends in Iowa: be careful what you do with that corn of the cob there.<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Next question. Go!<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #4:</strong>  Moments ago on the Hill, Senator Schumer, of New York, suggested that The Pres...<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  All right, sit down.  We donât talk about Schmucky.<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Next question.  Victoria.<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #5:</strong>  Does the President support Senator Clintonâs move to have the generals calling for Secretary Rumsfeldâs ouster, if you like, to testify before the Senate Armed Service Committee?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>    We donât much care what Hillary Rotten Clinton proposes here. These generals are free to testify all they want. As to Hillary Clintonâs move, if sheâd move off shore, it would be better for the country. <br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Next question. You.<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #6:</strong>  The President is the chief executive charged with enforcing the laws of the United States and the law says an illegal entrant is to be deported. Yet yesterday, he said mass deportation wouldnât work and my question: by articulating that policy, isnât the President violating his executive duties?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Sounds like Les Kinsolving, brilliant question. Of course he is. Open borders. Doing jobs Americans won't do and all that.<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Next.<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #6:</strong>  Londonâs Daily Telegraph quotes Israeli Defense Minister, Shaul Mofaz, as saying, and this is a quote, âOf all the threats we face, Iran is the biggest.  Since Hitler, we have not faced such a threat.  And my question: does the Bush administration disagree with this statement, with a probable Israeli nuclear attack to prevent an Iranian nuclear bombing of Tel Aviv?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Well, as you know, we're working very closely with the UN, the EU, NATO, the PU, and anybody else out there who we can talk to as we prepare to bomb them into an ice-skating rink <br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Next and last question. You.<br />
 <br />
<strong>WHPCM #7:</strong>  The President made a phone call to Prime Minister Harper, on the weekend. Can you tell us about the contents of that call?  And number two, was there, from the President, an offer, a compromise, a solution on softwood lumber?<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Who the hell is Prime Minister Harper? Oh, the new guy in Canada. Yes. We did have a phone conversation and the contents of which are secret. Youâll have to wait for Mary McCarthy to speak to Dana Priest.<br />
 <br />
<strong>ML:</strong>  Any more questions out there? Seeing none. Thank you.<br />
