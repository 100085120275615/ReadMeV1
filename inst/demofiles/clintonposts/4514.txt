<p>I admit it: I thought <span class="caps">DOPA</span> was too dopey to be very worried about. After all, Net Neutrality seemed to me to be more important in the long run, and more embattled. I never imagined that <span class="caps">DOPA</span> would make it very far, and so I wasn&#8217;t worried about it. As <a href="http://weblogg-ed.com/2006/dopa-passes/">Will Richardson notes</a> the anti-social networking bill has passed in the House of Representatives. The vote was 410-15. My response is aligned with the American Library Association&#8217;s: <a href="http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6357145.html">what are these guys smoking?< ?a></p>

	<p>So, time to </a><a href="http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">call your senator</a>. Really. Schools already are too much like prisons. At least, social networking provides a bit of escape, and a chance for students to be proactive. At most, it encourages self-driven learning, collaboration, and creativity. Let&#8217;s not let our congresscritters add more blinders to students eyes.</p>

	<p>In particular, I&#8217;m going to be calling Hillary Clinton&#8217;s office to make clear that if she expects to get any of the under-40 (yeah, yeah, I had another birthday&#8212;and I won&#8217;t be part of this group <i>too</i> much longer&#8212;but 40 is the new 30) vote in future elections, going after social networking is the wrong way to do it. And I promise, when it comes to 2008, I will remember her vote on this issue, and I will be very noisy about it.</p>
