It'd be one thing if we were talking about Hillary Clinton's bust being in a natural history museum, but Hillary's boobs on display in a Sex Museum?<br /><blockquote><em>A presidential bust of  Hillary Clinton is set to be unveiled at the Museum of Sex on August 9, 2006 at 10 am.  Accentuating her sexual power and bolstered by the presidential seal, <b>The Presidential Bust of Hillary Rodham Clinton: The First Woman President of the United States of America</b> will be officially open for public viewing on August 9 for a limited six week run. <br /> <br />Artist Daniel Edwards describes this new sculpture as capturing Clinton âwith her head held high, a youthful spirit and a face matured by wisdom. Presented in a low cut gown, her cleavage is on display prominently portraying sexual power which some people still  consider too threatening."  [ <a href="http://museumofsex.com/" target="_blank">Museum of Sex Press Release</a>]</em></blockquote><br />What's even more bizarre is that <b>Sharon Stone is the inspiration</b> for the topless Hillary statue. Stone said earlier this year, regarding Hillary running in '08, "But I think it is too soon for her to run. This may sound odd but a woman should be past her sexuality when she runs. Hillary still has sexual power and I  don't think people will accept that. It's too threatening." <br /><br />Ah...WTF. Must lay down now. Head is spinning. Eyes burning.<br /><br />
