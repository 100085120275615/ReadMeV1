<div>When Dubai government started to consider buying American and British ports, their main concern was in relation to get the permission from both governments authorities. Many British argued regarding the social and political issues when they decided to sell their ports to a company owned by Dubai government.  The debate in Britain gets in a smooth process and then received the complete agreement from the different social and political organizations after the government arrangement. On the other hand, in the United States the government policy for the new entrants affect the process speed of finishing the deal of buying 6 harbors. It is clear that Dubai government was new entrant for the ports operation industry in the U.S but the government policy is shaped by many factors not just the White House as many think in the Middle East because people in that region live in authoritarian regimes. After getting the U.S administration agreement, Dubai government seemed to be sure that they finish the deal successfully. Meanwhile Senator Hillary Clinton refuse her husband advise and began a campaign in the Congress to discontinue the deal. She thinks that operating U.S ports by a foreign company might affect the United States national security. Although the United States sea guards will have the full responsibilities about protecting the U.S boards and Dubai company will be responsible just for the financial operation of the 6 harbors Sen. Clinton refuse to accept that a U.S port would be in others hand. It might be just a political position that might help Mrs. Clinton for her plan to run in the presidential election as many are saying. This conflict between Dubai government and the authorities in the U.S arise an important issue about how significant is the studying of government policy and the process of the decision making in any country a company is willing to enter its market. The studying saves time, effort and money.</div>
