<span>Welcome to boredom in Iraq. Iâll be your host.</span><br /><span><br />No shit, there I was. Up to my nuts in empty cigarette packs, Gatorade bottles, and dead radio batteries. Sitting in a cement tower with what feels like a hairdryer blowing in my face. Occasionally using the binoculars to look at some random Iraqi who possesses a 99.9% chance of minding his own business, for hours I watch donkeys and sheep and dirt.<br /><br /><em>âYou can dip, but there is no smoking allowed in the towers! Itâs easy to spot a cherry at night!â </em><br /><br />I canât see a lit cigarette from fifty meters. Even at its brightest point during sweet buzz inducing inhalation.<br /><br />This assumes that Haji can shoot straight, has cat-like-night-vision, and possesses the patience to crawl through half a mile of dirt and dried out grass to then lie in the same spot until the time is right. Then heâll put my cigarette cherry is his sights and pop off a single round. My head will explode JFK style as my brother in arms is sprayed with red mist and a dab of gray matter. Considering most guys go the cheap route and buy their cigarettes from the Haji shop heâll probably then relish in what remains of my American cancer stick. My pure, untainted, delicious American tobaccoâ¦ and to think I didnât smoke until I drove through Baghdad.<br />More power to him. Iâm not there to enjoy it anymore. Take the pack and my Zippo while youâre at it.<br /><br />In reality Iâll probably see a giant flash in the middle of a field and if the shooter is lucky I might hear a whiz. Using my night vision Iâll say aloud âwow, that lump of blackness with a thing sticking out of it bears a vague resemblance to a man holding a rifle.â Then Iâll liberally apply a coating of 7.62 mm via M240B. Or Iâll call in a mortar strikeâ¦ depends on what kind of mood Iâm in. And how far out our squirrelly little wannabe sniper is.<br /><br /><em>âLeft fifty, add one hundredâ¦ fire for effect.â Take cover. Plug ears. Peek eyes over concrete windowsill.</em><br /><em><br /></em>BOOM BOO-BOO-BOOM BOOM BOO-BOOM!<br /></em><br />Then Iâll light another cigarette and bask in my glory. <em>âHa! I made that happen.â</em><br /><br />I read a book that mentioned the correlation between shooting a gun and the pleasure a man receives from spreading his seed. âShooting a gun.â What coarse, vulgar languageâ¦ <em>âgunâ</em> is only acceptable when used in reference to shotguns and machine guns. It is a rifle, a pistol, a carbineâ¦ an M4, an M1 Garand, a Luger, a 1911, an AK, an MG-42â¦ anything but <em>âgun.â</em> People who want to curb Second Amendment rights use the word âgun.â âHandgunâ is the c-word of the firearm community.<br /><br />Yeah, Iâll admit, I receive a certain unexplainable gratification from doing anything firearm related. Not to say I have to wash my pants after I get back from the range or anything. Why the fuck do you think people join the infantry? Every person who is born with a penis and was made in America should have an inherent desire that is infused during inception to blow shit up and send a hundred round belt of linked ammunition into a target.<br /><br />What I lack in masculinity due to my disdain for professional sports I make up for in my ridiculous amount of knowledge concerning firearms. And, come onâ¦ whatâs manlier than fighting in a war? The Greatest Generation was made up of men who fought in their war. Ronald Reagan. Thereâs a classic American hero, may he forever rest in peace. George Washington. Teddy Roosevelt, the greatest American hero that ever lived.<br /><br />Thatâs what lacking in politicians today. It should be a requirement that all politicians running for anything State level and beyond have at least three years of active military service. No draft dodging. No I-served-in-the-Air-National-Guard-because-Daddy-has-connections. Active. Military. Service. And none of that throwing-of-your-medals-over-a-fence-and-damning-your-comrades-in-the-process. They werenât even his medals, anyway.<br /><br />Donât forget Robert E. Lee! The South will rise again!<br /><br />A quarter of the Army is made up by folks like me, Mid-Westerners. Another quarter is made up of people from the South. And everyone else is from Texas. Iâve definitely seen my fair share of Confederate flag wavers in my Army days. Not that thereâs anything wrong with that. âCause when Hillary Clinton gets elected in 2008 and signs an executive order that bans civilian ownership of pistols Iâll be waving the Stars and Bars as I lead my ragtag band of American vigilantes and liberate the White House.<br /><br />The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of tyrants.<br />Thomas Jefferson, a great American hero, says so.<br />But he didnât fight in a war. And neither did Ronald Reagan; he made movies.<br /><br />â¦<br /><br />The South will rise again!<br /><br />These are the kinds of conversations you have on tower guard. You comment on how you can smell your own nut sweat and when the last time you had a shower was. Whether you jerked off in the shower. How it compared to the last time you jerked off in the porta-shitter in 115 degree heat.<br /><br />Just the other day the pube fairy made a visit to the showers. Who the fuck takes a beard trimmer and cuts off all their excess in the shower? Where Iâm supposed to be cleaning myself? Be like me, do the right thing and trim that shit outside where your shedding will fertilize the Iraqi soil. But since thereâs no grass or plants to fertilize youâll have to settle for dirt.<br /><br />You wanna raise morale ten percent? Shave your nuts. No joke. Youâll be able to feel a draft when wearing shorts. I walked around with a shit eating grin on my face for the whole day when I first shaved my test-ick-leeze after seven months of unimpeded growth. Everyone asked why I was so happy. I told them they didnât want to know, but, of course, they had to press the issue.<br /><br />And it cuts down on the nut sweat smell.<br /><br />I actually found myself banging my head against the tower wall in boredom; not that <em>âtee hee, Iâm so bored Iâm going to bang my head against the wall to get a reaction.â </em>This was actual <em>âgood thing Iâm wearing this Kevlar helmet because I didnât even notice the banging until my tower guard partner noticed and commented.â</em> Yes. Definitely going out of my mind. Combat is 99%<em> âthis is the stupidest shit everâ or âI have never been so bored in my life.â</em> The remaining 1% is you going <em>âOH FUCK SHIT SHIT SHIT IâM GOING TO DIE.â</em><br /><em><br /></em>Energy drinks. You can buy them at the Haji shop and theyâre a life saver when pulling late night missions or sitting in a tower at three in the fucking morning saying âlooks like Haji ran out of powerâ for the eight thousandth time when the lights go out. When youâve smoked so many cigarettes that your throat is all raspy, energy drinks produced in obscure Middle Eastern or Eastern European countries make a fine treatment. Sweet, sweet taurine.<br /></em><br />Red Bull ainât got shit.</span><br /><br /><span>Then thereâs the sex. Oh, the sex. By the time you get off tower guard expect to know every sick and twisted act your comrade has committed in the bedroom. His car. The barracks. The slide at the park. In Iraq. I always get excited when Iâm on tower guard with someone new; it means new stories. Which means I donât have to drink as many energy drinks and smoke as many cigarettes to stay awake.</span><br /><br /><span>Sexual conquests. Sexual escapades. Doesnât matter what you want to call it, youâll hear them all regardless. The foursome he had with his buddy and two girls describing themselves as âlesbians looking for a little fun.â The random fat girl he picked up at the bar during leave because he was just that hammered. How he lost his virginity to some Latin chick eight years his elder in the backseat of her old manâs Cadillac.</span><br /><br /><span>âYou sick, sick manâ¦ sodomy is against the law, Snuffy.â Thatâs what the First Sergeant told him, shaking his head while attempting to maintain his composure and not fall off his chair laughing.</span><br /><br /><span>Ever seen or read âJarhead?â Swofford talks about how to alleviate boredom in the desert and multiple lines are devoted to masturbation. Iâd say itâs more like chronic masturbation, but, hey, whatever; we all have hairy palms. Living with three dudes makes it impossible for a little bit of alone time. Hence jellyfish floating around in the shower. Hence enduring 115 degrees in the porta-shitter. Hence the holy grail of all care packages: baby wipes and lotion.</span><br /><br /><span>The Army said we couldnât bring porn into Iraq because Muslim culture puts the ixnay on the pornograph-ay. Apparently they do the same with alcohol. My fucking ass! I guess theyâve never seen Arabs go nuts over a Maxim issue. âGood, mis-tah! Good!â Then they produce their own form of sick and twisted pornography thatâs dirty even by corrupted American standards. Mustnât forget the drunken Hajis we pulled over. We took their beer and sent them on their way, laughing as they swerved the whole way.</span><br /><br /><span>Now you think Iâm a bastard because I could have caused a drunken driving accident by not detaining these two man-dress-wearing-drunkards and impounding their rusty ass white Toyota. MAADD says so; Mothers Against Arab Drunk Driving. Great American heroes.</span><br /><br /><span>Sorry. My bad. I never got issued my ACU-pattern-breathalyzer. âYou donât need it,â is what the nice woman at the Central Issue Facility told me. âMuslim culture prohibits alcohol.â Yeah, porn too, lady. Which is why Iâm staring at a magazine with adult stars that look like they came out of the 80s. Most Iraqi men have a mustache, bare minimumâ¦ coincidence? I think not.</span><br /><br /><span>Thank you, laptop. âC:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\Pluginsâ should actually read âC:\Super Secret Hidden Ninja Shit\Covert Porno\Videos\Hot Blondes To Fantasize About While In Iraq.â</span><br /><br /><span>And when Iâm done Iâm gunna smoke another cigarette. That seems to keep me from banging my head against the wall.<br /><br /><br /></span><br /></span>
