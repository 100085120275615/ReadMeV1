She was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor while the President was giving his speech because she was wearing an anti-war shirt, which violated House rules, and then was refused to cooperate when told she couldn't wear it.<br /><br />9:11- The President has reached the podium.

Thank you, God bless you, and may God bless America."<br /><br />[Applause #63]<br /><br />Whoa... the Democrats talk about Bush's smirk, but what the heck is up with Tim Kaine?  His left eyebrow keeps quirking up, and it's kinda creeping me out.<br /><br />Well, it's better than last year's response.  BOTH of Nancy Pelosi's eyebrows creeped me out.<br /><br />Kaine's going on about NCLB.  I don't really approve of it (well intentioned, but overall a mistake) but still, he's kinda in a glass house since Ted Kennedy helped write it.<br /><br />Kaine's response is well written, even if I don't agree with anything he's saying.  But he kinda sounds patronising- like he's speaking to children.<br /><br />Ack.  I can't stand Kaine, but it's not like his Republican opponent was much better.  Kilgore ran a pathetic campaign.  My thirteen year old brother could have managed it better.<br /><br />Wahwahwah the evil Republicans hate the people they just want to help their buddies in the oil industry make money.<br /><br />Yeah, that's why Bush wants us to develop alternative energy sources.<br /><br />I must say, the fire in the fireplace in the background was a nice touch.  Makes the message seem all homey-like.<br /><br />Newt Gingrich says Kaine's response was about as good as the Democratic response could have been.
