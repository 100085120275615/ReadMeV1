<div align="justify">Anger can be used for good, or the antithesis. When used correctly, and in the proper spirit, it can be a good thing. The Bible does say, â<em>Be ye angry, and sin not: let not the sun go down upon your wrath:</em>â Listen up, I donât believe that Jesus Christ was sporting a Benny Hinn smile when He tossed the money changers out of the temple and then whipped them to boot! John 2:15 says, â<em>And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;</em>â If channeled correctly, anger might just make you excited about something you yearn for, but canât seem to obtain; unless you exhibit a little righteous rage.<br />
<br />For example: say youâre an unemployed, or nepotistic, 30-year old guy who does nothing but sit on your backside listening to music, eating snacks, living with mommy and dating 19-year old girls. You know what? You should get angry with yourself because you, clearly, arenât the sharpest knife in the drawer. You do not have a life, and it should make you mad that other people are actually contributing something our societyâunlike you.<br />
<br />Maybe youâre overweight. Remember what a delight it used to be to walk through a grocery store without having to be carted around in the handicap scooter? Remember the joy being able to actually see your feet? Remember those simple things? You do? Does it make you mad that you donât get to enjoy those pleasures any longer? It does! Great! And now you suddenly have the desire to start eating correctly and exercising. See how positive anger can actually be?<br />
<br />Righteous wrath not only works for personal improvement, but it can also influence positive change on all aspects of our society; if we will get righteously angered according to scripture. Ah, but thereâs the rub, because liberal do-gooders have convinced us that itâs a hindrance to world peace if we get mad. Being angry is forbidden in our present day cultureâunless itâs something that the liberal thought police feel you should be upset about, and then youâre forced to fume right along with the rest of the politically correct whiners.<br />
<br />Since the âhippieâ movement of the late 60âs weâve been forced to chant the mantra of the âpeace and loveâ crowd that being nice and accepting of anything and everything---even if it is utterly and absolutely senseless---is our duty. And it just so happens that idiocy is the core characteristic of our nation at this present time. Although the media feeds us our daily helping of lunacy and we are not supposed to be upset by it; most convenient if you are the peddler of this madness.<br />
<br />Because we have allowed ourselves to be programmed by the thought police to be nice and not get a little hot under the collar (unless, of course, it is something that upsets the liberal mindset), we donât even blink an eye when we see the vile or hear the vulgar; instead we force a smile. What a bunch of garbage weâve been sold by psycho/social educators into thinking that a display of righteous anger will permanently damage little Johnnyâs psyche. Today, people can do something appalling, destroy lives or exalt the depraved and whatâs to be our response? Weâre supposed to smile and say, âBless youâ¦Iâll pray for you. . .Have a nice day.â<br />
<br />Why do we show mock civility towards things that mock civility? âAnger is bad,â or so we have been lead to believe. And we donât want to be bad, do we? No, we want to be nice. Weâre supposed to be a calm group of pleasant and complicit pawns who display their Barbie and Ken Doll plastic smile no matter what kind of insanity gets shoved in our faces or down our throats.<br />
<br />Stop! Hit the pause button! It is time for a reality check just to make sure that my words will not be taken out of context. Being taken out of context has already cost me one job this year and, quite frankly, the unemployment line is not a safe place to be when someone goes postal because they just found out that their benefits have expired.<br />
<br />1. Donât vent your anger on loved ones, fellow Christians, those who are mentally incapacitated or the family pet.<br />
<br />2. Donât waste your wrath on the insignificant. For example, I really get irritated at those who are screaming for the government to take care of them and when the Hillary-Dillary-Dock (a.k.a. The Mother Goose of Fairy Tales) crowd really begin to flex their socialist agendas, these same clamoring dolts protest about losing their civil rights. Keep in mind that some folks are simply âdull of hearingâ and they have no understanding of the norm; let alone the complex. Instead of getting hot and bothered with those who are destined to drift aimlessly through this life, I just sit down in front of the keyboard and vent through my fingertips. Remember, anger has a shelf life, so use it sparingly and wisely.<br />
<br />As a Christian man concerned about my religious freedom, and being a conservative concerned about the permanence of our nation and its original intent, and being a parent concerned about leaving my children and grandchildren a nation that doesnât resemble a pornographic superstore, I have decided to direct my anger at the ones who have promoted cultural truth-decay; namely the âsugar-coaters.â Why waste time shadow boxing with punks when I can land a knock out blow upside the head of those responsible for taking the bite out righteousness due to truth-decay? </div>

<br />So if you believe buying another toy for your kid will make up for your absence in his life, forcing your 30 year old child get a real job and a place of their own is being too harsh, assuring your baby girl never loses her self esteem even if she is six months pregnant at age 15 is being gracious, not permitting a mature, responsible adult to tell your child ânoâ to keep them from wandering into a busy street when you are momentarily unavailable somehow protects them, taking sides with family even when you know the truth of a matter is a form of loyalty, taking sides with family even when you donât know the truth of a matter is unconditional love, or forming alliances with a lost and dying world in lieu of seeking a closer union with the brethren will help the lost to get saved; you had better lace up your gloves, climb into the ring and listen for the bell, because we are going to stir up some righteous anger. Ding! Round one! </div>
