As the race for 2008 builds, Democratic Sen. John Kerry has left little doubt about his intentions to try again after his narrow loss to President Bush in 2004. He isn't the only also-ran considering another marathon."</blockquote></font>John Kerry is up to the challenge!<br /><br />John Norris expressed it best:<blockquote><font color="blue">"John Norris, who managed Kerry's campaign in Iowa and ran his field operations in the general election, said candidates learn valuable lessons in a national campaign that could be put to use in a second bid. Sadly, he said, voters do not see it that way.<br /><br />"That sentiment you talked about is really strong out there," Norris said. "You know, 'He's had his chance.' I think that's shortsighted.""</blockquote></font>The article points out the history of second candidacies:<blockquote><font color="blue">"Adlai Stevenson got a second chance against President Eisenhower in 1956, but many suspect that Democrats were pessimistic about the odds of unseating a popular president. Their doubts were realized when Stevenson lost again.<br /><br />Republicans, on the other hand, are more willing to give their nominees another try. Richard M. Nixon lost the presidency in 1960 and won the White House in 1968. Bob Dole sought his party's nomination in 1980 and 1988. He secured the GOP nod in 1996 but lost the general election to President Clinton."</blockquote></font>Nobody said it would be easy!<br /><br />Senator Kerry is right about Iraq.<br /><br />Right about the Environment.<br /><br />Right about Church and State.<br /><br />Right about Women's Issues.<br /><br />He has the experience, the courage, and the demeanor to be the President this nation needs.<br /><br />Keep on Coming John!  We have got your back!<br /><br />Bob
