<div>I know I will get support for my part if I were to get it off the ground by myself...which I nominate Hillary for the job...not me unless no other volunteer is available..and maybe not even then..it's complicated for sure and extensive in scope...large plans like this idea are seldom feasable in the end..but will write about my orphan experiences as I took on many to see the ups and downs of it.</div>
