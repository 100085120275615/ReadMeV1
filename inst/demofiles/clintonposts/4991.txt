<span><strong>Gate to Satanâs Lair Opens in Howard Deanâs Backyard<br /></strong><br />(Wells River, VT) In hindsight, it now seems obvious that Howard Deanâs 2004 infamous scream was not the cry for psychiatric help once thought, but rather the result of a Satanic curse that compelled Americaâs pre-eminent freedom-hater to speak in tongues.<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4470/1753/1600/Dean%20scream.jpg"></a><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4470/1753/1600/Dean%20scream.0.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4470/1753/400/Dean%20scream.jpg" border="0" /></a><br /></span><a href="http://www.caledonianrecord.com/pages/local_news/story/db068e2de"><span><strong>A gateway to hell that recently opened its hellish maw in the former governorâs backyard</strong></span></a><span> surprised few, as it has long been expected that the out-of-the-mainstream Dean long-ago sold his soul to Satan for the chance to be a âlegitimateâ player in national politics. The anticipated appearance of âhellâs hallwayâ in Vermont was shocking only in that it was so long in coming. âQuite frankly, I expected the devil would call in his note soon after Kerry accepted the nomination,â slurred Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA,) who has been avoiding the Dark Lordâs debt collectors for decades now. âIf I know Satan, and trust me, I do, heâs always gonna get paid.â Kennedy then excused himself, and subsequently sacrificed the last remaining Massachusetts virgin on his Hyannisport stone altar.<br /><br />While secular Vermonters have feebly described the hole that suddenly appeared on the grounds of the Dean estate as a collapsed septic system, credible sources contacted by <em>Spurious George</em> say otherwise. Senator Jim Jeffords (I-VT,) a longtime neighbor of Deanâs and someone who, despite leaving the Republican party, can probably still be trusted more than any Democrat, described hearing unearthly voices hauntingly echoing up from the nightmarish opening. âI distinctly heard FDR, JFK, and, I think, Hubert H. Humphrey, crying out in agony,â testified Jeffords. âWhile it was hard to hear exactly what they were saying, as rats were chewing on their entrails and all, Iâm pretty sure I heard âHillary in 2008!â</span>
