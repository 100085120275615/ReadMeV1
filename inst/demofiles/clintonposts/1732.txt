<br />"In the never-ending Aphrodisia v. Brava debate, the editors say: Aphrodisia is about sex and Brava is about romance. Hillary Sares (the main Aphrodisia editor) says the term âerotic romanceâ with the imprint is a misnomer. The books are not really romance and donât have to be. Use of the title is for marketing - Kensington wants the books in the romance section and wants to reach romance readers. Thatâs it. And, the only legal on the sex is that it be legal."<br />
<br />I've seen this being debated on a few other blogs. I haven't read but one book in the Aphrodisia line so can't really comment. Others have said they have and don't see where they are that different from Brava.<br />
<br />I still agree with Angela Knight on anything being marketed with erotic romance having a HEA. I won't back down on that. And I do think the nonrequirement of them is going to backfire from what I've seen because readers seem to want the HEA when they are reading romance.<br />
<br />For me, the HEA means the couple (or group) is together. They may not necessarily be married or have kids, but they are together. I know HEA means different things to different people.<br />
<br />May the muses have romance<br />Lany</div>
