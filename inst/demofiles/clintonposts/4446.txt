<p>Did anybody else catch Nicole Kidman&#8217;s reaction (facial expression) during the Grammy Awards last night after Kelly Clarkson won her first award?  Then when she realized the camera was on her, she tried to twist it into something more pleasant, but it didn&#8217;t work.  It was just like Hillary Clinton&#8217;s pained expression after Bush mentioned his father and Bill being buddies during the State of the Union.
