<br />Another year, another exercise in nearly unwatchable mediocrity.<br /><br />What follows are my notes on the '06 State of the Union Address. They're partial and rather disjointed - but hey, at least this way you didn't have to actually watch the thing.<br /><br />First off it's worth noting the very different approach Dub took this year,  with a 39 percent approval rating and several potential scandals hanging over his head, as compared to last year when he was flying (relatively) high with a fresh re-election and a 53 percent approval rating.<br /><br />Both speeches clocked in a just under an hour (55 minutes this year and 53 last year, by my decidely unofficial watch). But this year Dub's marionettes front-loaded the War on Terror and devoted the second portion of the speech to domestic issues - a reversal of last year's speech. Each section ran 25 minutes, give or take, as opposed to last year when the domestic piece lasted for more than a half hour and the foreign policy bit ran only about 20 minutes.<br /><br />What does all this add up to? A weakened President, chastened by the misplaced arrogance of last year's attempt at Social Security <strike>destruction</strike> reform, tacks back to his strengths: national security and the War on Terror (although he's been steadily sinking on those counts as well).<br /><br />And FYI, the obligatory CNN/USA Today "snap poll" taken just after the speech ended showed that 48 percent of respondents had a "very positive" impression of the speech. That's way down from 60 percent last year, and the second-lowest of Dub's Presidency (45 percent in '04; in '01, '02 and '03 he scored 66, 74 and 50 percent, respectively) <br /><br />This comports with my general impression, which is that Jethro was flat, flat flat, and the speech itself was uninspiring, uninspiring, uninspiring.<br /><br />Now, onto the highlights.<br /><br /><b>Act I. Affect and Images</b><br /><ul><li>The Thrill Is Gone. It was almost impossible to find the Gucci Cowboy Swagger or the Overgrown Fratboy Smirk this year. Without the unwarranted arrogance, Dub ain't got much left, which explains why his performance was so... limp. Which leads me to...<br /><br /><li>Crickets. For the most part, the applause was less enthusiastic, and of shorter duration, than last year and in most years past (which includes Dub, Clinton and Bush the Elder). It was just over three minutes from when Dub entered the chamber, to when the applause died down so House Speaker Dennis Hastert could formally introduce him. And it took only 30 seconds from that moment for the second round to end so Bush could start speaking. In both cases, the hootin' and a-hollerin' one normally hears at the SOTU was notable for its absence. With a couple of exceptions, this trend continued throughout the entire speech.<br /><br /><li>Here's Your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorena_Bobbitt" target="_blank">Bobbit</a> Moment. Towards the end, Dub introduced the Social Security issue by noting that many Baby Boomers were turning 60 this year, "including two of my father's favorite people - me and President Clinton." As the joke fell flat, CNN cut to Hillary, all pursed lips and daggers. I've never before seen someone look homicidal at the SOTU.<br /><br /><li>As with the ink-dipped finger trick from last year's Iraqi elections, I'm not sure if my reaction to the following was the direct opposite of what you'll be reading and viewing in the mainstream news media over the next few days - but I found the parading out of the family of a recently killed U.S. serviceman to be pathetic and not a little gruesome. The sadness in the eyes of the poor man's widow and parents seemed not at all attenuated by the ostensibly heartfelt tribute offered them by their Commander in Grief. But maybe that's just me.<br /><br /><li>Didn't See That Coming, Didya? After his bad joke about himself and Clinton, Dub continued his lead-in to Social Security by saying, "Congress did not act last year on my proposal to save Social Security" - and was interrupted mid-sentence by thunderous applause and a standing-O from every Democrat in the place. It was easily one of the top three applause moments in terms of volume and intensity, and I daresay even the most disinterested observer would have to agree that it was highly embarrassing.<br /><br /><li>Going Nukuler. This chimpanzee of a leader still can't say "nuclear." After all these years, one can't help but wonder if it's intentional at this point - perhaps Rove has made a virtue of a necessity by convincing himself that "nukuler" sounds folksy or down-to-earth. Whatever the reason, it never fails to boggle the mind, no matter how many times one hears Jethro utter it.<br /></ul><br /><br /><b>Act II. Language and Framing</b><br /><ul><li>The speech began with a tribute to Coretta Scott King (who died today, FYI in case you were hiding under a rock). One might argue that it was a cheap gesture, or simply a politically compulsory move. But even so, it does in my view indicate the progress that's been made in mainstreaming the advances wrought by the civil rights movement, even over the last 10-15 years.<br /><br /><li>All the Great Leaders Are Dead, and I'm not Feeling So Well Myself. Dub declared himself "humbled by the privilege" of giving the SOTU (even though it's, like, totally a Constitutional requirement), and told Congress in the first three minutes that "it's been my honor to serve with you." It seems rather like the sort of language one should use in one's final SOTU. Perhaps Dub's thinking that Mikie Brown had it right with his "Can I go home yet?" email.<br /><br /><li>It's All Good, Trust Me. "The state of the union is strong," said the President. Utterly unremarkable, except that he said it within the first three minutes of the speech, which in my memory is utterly unprecedented. Typically a President will wait to utter the famous line until he has provided some, you know, evidence to back it up. But I suppose the baseless assertion has worked for this guy in the past, so why not?<br /><br /><li>And in Case You Forgot: 9-11!!!! The first mention of September 11 came less than five minutes in (at about the 3:30 mark in fact). Of course.<br /><br /><li>Victory Is at Hand. "We are winning" in Iraq, said Dub, and our "strategy for victory" is working. Can't put my finger on it precisely, but for some reason he sounded more like he was talking about Vietnam than I've ever heard him sound before.<br /><br /><li>The War on... Isolationism. The speech was structured primarily as a critique of isolationism, as a way of justifying the war in Iraq, and also as a way of promoting free trade (in which context isolationism became protectionism). This, it seems to me, was a curious and not terribly effective choice, since it's a paper tiger. Thanks to decades of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoliberalism" target="_blank">neoliberalism</a> in American politics and cultural life, there's very little isolationist or protectionist sentiment among the President's enemies. In fact, with the partial exception of some segments of organized labor, one can safely say that isolationism thrives most these days in the rightwing Republican base. Put simply, fighting isolationism gets Dub nothing in terms of political leverage against Congressional Dems, or much of anyone else. Ditto for his attempt to bash Dems for "second-guessing" and "defeatism" - it didn't destroy Murtha the first - or second, or third - time, so why Dub's handlers expected it to work this time around is beyond me.<br /><br /><li>How Offensive Can You Get? The frame of isolationism allowed - or perhaps masked - a foreign policy agenda utterly lacking in specifics. Not until the 33-minute mark - when the foreign policy bit was well over - did Dub articulate a specific policy proposal or idea. Up until then, he simply repeated the mantra "we must stay on the offensive" to describe U.S. policy on, well, everything.<br /><br /><li>Keep Hope Alive, and a Place Called Hope, and, Well, You Get the Point. "A Hopeful Society" constituted the speech's secondary frame. "In a Hopeful Society," much of the domestic-issue portion of the speech went, something good happens - children achieve, people have health care, etc. And in order to encourage or produce that good outcome, Congress should support my policies - on tax cuts, tort reform, and so on. Not a great device, not a terrible device, certainly not an original device. I think it was serviceable enough to score a few points on some domestic issues.<br /><br /><li>The Sound Bite. On energy, Dub said, "America is addicted to oil." This was the first, and only, thing Wolf Blitzer noted right after the speech ended. And I'm sure it'll be the phrase on all the front pages, and on the tips of all the analysts' tongues, in the coming days. Big Oil Man Finds God, Embraces New Energy Technologies, etcetera, etcetera.<br /><br /><li>To Stem or not to Stem? Dub once again spoke out in favor of laws banning the sale of human embryos. This year he added to that a plea to Congress to outlaw human cloning in all its forms, the creation of embryos solely for use in scientific experiments, and, bizarrely, the creation of human-animal hybrids. It's difficult to tell because the language is so coded, but as I listened I wondered if perhaps the administration isn't considering softening its position a bit on stem cell research using embryos that have been created for purposes other than experimentation (i.e. from fertility attempts). Of course, it could just be wishful thinking on my part.<br /></ul><br /><br /><b>Act III. Substance (Sort of)</b><br /><ul><li>Social Security, Perhaps. Utterly defeated last year, Bush this time called only for the formation of a "bipartisan commission" to study the impact of the Baby Boomers on Social Security and Medicare. So now we can spell victory c-o-m-m-i-s-s-i-o-n.<br /><br /><li>Democracy on the March. He applauded the rise of democracy in the Middle East and around the world. In what was actually a pretty heartening moment, he observed that the world had "about two dozen" democracies in 1945, while today it has 122. (Of course, the definition of democracy is pretty slippery, but hey, effective rhetoric is effective rhetoric.) More specifically, he cited recent elections in Iraq. Afghanistan and, yes, the Palestinian territories. On the ticklish question of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas" target="_blank">Hamas</a>, he stated, "The Palestinian people have voted," and now Hamas must renounce violence, affirm Israel's right to exist, disarm, and cease terrorist activities. In other words, it was good that the Palestinians voted, and we respect that they voted for Hamas instead of Fatah - the only thing we require is that Hamas immediately and unilaterally transform itself into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah" target="_blank">Fatah</a>. <br /><br /><li>Maybe It's a Little More Complicated than the Axis of Evil. In addition to Iran, Syria and North Korea, Dub acknowledged Zimbabwe and Burma as places where people live with undemocratic states. It may not seem like much, but when was the last time a President mentioned Burma, with its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burma" target="_blank">appalling human rights record</a>, in the SOTU?<br /><br /><li>College Loans, um, Nevermind. Nothing this year about increasing the size of Pell Grants - in fact, nothing at all about college education, which is unsurprising given that the administration has succeeded in cutting college loans in this year's budget.<br /><br /><li>Stay the Course, Withdraw the Troops. Troop levels in Iraq will decrease - there, he said it. But, talking tough as ever, he noted that "those decisions will be made by our military commanders, not by politicians in Washington, D.C." This statement is what is known in technical terms as a f*cking lie - the decisions, Dub was saying, will be made by politicians in the White House, under whose pressure the generals will continue to pursue a warped policy that prevents either the deployment of sufficient troops or the prompt withdraw of large numbers of troops, instead leaving the military in a limbo of large-scale but still insufficient force strength, with personnel pushed to their limits and forced to extend their tours of duty.<br /><br /><li>Get <strike>Shorty</strike> al Qaeda, Kill <strike>Bill</strike> al Qaeda. The old arrogance and brazenness made an appearance when Dub defended clearly illegal warrantless wiretapping by claiming that it's being used solely to track al Qaeda - another f*cking lie. Time for impeachment, plain and simple.<br /><br /><li>The Syrianna Plan. Dub unveiled the Advanced Energy Initiative, which promotes, among other things, non-corn-based ethanol production, wind power, solar power, "zero-emission coal-fired plants" (an Orwellian construction if ever there were one), and "safe, clean nuclear enegy" (beyond Orwellian, that one). On the plus side, he articulated a goal of "replacing 75 percent of Middle East oil imports by 2025" and "making our dependence on Middle Eastern oil a thing of the past." Hard to be against that one - not only for U.S. self-interest but for the future political stability of the Middle East.<br /><br /><li>Health Care, or Not. Dub had specifics on health care, which would be a mark in his favor if his specifics didn't all, how you say, suck. He advocated wider use of electronic medical records to cuts administrative costs (of course, single-payer health care would eliminate tens of billions of such costs per year); increased use of Health Savings accounts (i.e. Social Security privatization by other means); portable coverage (with absolutely no sense of what he meant or how it would happen); and, my favorite, tort reform to lower medical malpractice premiums.<br /><br /><li>And the Rest. A wealth of other items came in rapid succession, including, once again, advocacy of an impossibly baroque <a href="http://www.farmworkers.org/benglish.html" target="_blank">bracero</a>/<i><a href="http://216.239.39.104/translate_c?hl=en&sl=de&u=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastarbeiter&prev=/search%3Fq%3Dgastarbeiter%26hl%3Den%26lr%3D%26safe%3Doff" target="_blank">gastarbeiter</a></i> program, meant to placate both the business and rightwing camps of his party on the immigration issue; advocacy of re-upping the Ryan White Act for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; declaring support for unspecified ethical reforms in Congress; pushing an initiative meant to promote math and science education; and, in a spectacularly unconvincing manner, trying to align himself with his own critics on the constellation of issues raised by Hurricane Katrina.<br /></ul><br /><br /><b>Act IV.
