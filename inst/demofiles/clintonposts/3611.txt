<br />WASHINGTON -- A few days before Sen. John Kerry picked John Edwards as his vice presidential candidate this summer, Republican pollster Frank Luntz was asked by a TV network to test the appeal of seven potential running mates.
<br />Luntz read a description and played a video clip of each of the Democrats to a group of swing voters.
<br />The voters liked Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh the most.
<br />"I think he would make an incredible candidate," Luntz said. "I think he has exactly the attributes that will appeal to swing voters that John Kerry lost this time. A centrist approach. A positive outlook. And a gentle demeanor."
<br />Bayh was not picked by Kerry or, in 2000, by Al Gore for the Democratic ticket. But he is among those most frequently mentioned as a Democratic presidential contender in 2008, even as he tries to tamp down speculation about his future.
<br />Admirers say he has the right attributes for a White House bid, especially a political resume and style that exude moderation. Yet Bayh's shortcomings, including a cautious personality that lacks star power, could be a challenge if he tries to compete on a national stage.
<br />"Of all the people who have not run for president before, he's the leading new candidate," said Chuck Todd, editor in chief of The Hotline, an online political newsletter. "The only thing missing from him on paper from being the perfect candidate would be actually being Latino."
<br />The key reason Bayh is being touted is the divide between Democratic -- or "blue" -- states along the coasts and parts of the Midwest and the Republican -- or "red" -- states everywhere else.
<br />While President Bush racked up large margins in the red South and West and made inroads in the blue Midwest, Bayh was easily re-elected in a red state, raking in 62 percent of the vote. That's a higher tally than Bush's 60 percent in Indiana.
<br />Bayh did not have a strong opponent this year and was not targeted by the Republican Party, but many Democrats are worried their party is not connecting with crossover voters -- as Bayh has demonstrated he can -- in part because it's seen as being on the wrong side of a cultural divide.
<br />"We've got to look at folks that can speak to rural voters and Southern voters in particular, and Senator Bayh has a proven track record of being able to do that," said Iowa Democratic Party Chairman Gordon Fischer. "You're not going to succeed in a state like Indiana without winning some Republican votes, some rural votes. Even southern Indiana has a tinge of Southern politics to it."
<br />Polls and many political experts place New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton as the early front-runner for the 2008 Democratic nomination. But many Democrats are fearful that picking someone tagged as a liberal and from the heavily blue Northeast will guarantee failure and a rerun of the 2000 and 2004 electoral maps.
<br />Bayh said it's too early for him to talk about whether he will run or whether he has the resume the Democrats need.
<br />"I do think that whatever's right for the Democratic Party and right for the American people will be found in the center, both geographically and ideologically," Bayh said. "National security, economic growth, making government accountable and fiscal discipline, and then showing we're in tune with middle American values -- I think that's the right approach. Who embodies that best? We'll have to let the voters decide."
<br />The following are some of the factors that could affect Bayh's viability and decision to run:
<br />Moderate, but unknown
<br />Both as governor and senator, Bayh has cultivated an image as a moderate. He is chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, the moderate group that boosted the career of former President Bill Clinton. He also is part of a new group, called Third Way, which will push centrist legislation.
<br />In his first Senate term, Bayh broke with his party more often than the average Democrat, siding with Republicans most often on business, budget and taxes, and on national security issues.
<br />But there still is no big issue that Bayh is known for nationally, in the same way that Arizona Sen. John McCain -- a Republican who might run in 2008 -- championed campaign finance reform so that the issue now is synonymous with him.
<br />"If I were (Bayh), I'd pick out a couple issues in the Senate that matter to him . . . and become a national spokesmen on them," said Richard Harpootlian, a Democratic activist and former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party.
<br />Merle Black, a presidential scholar at Emory University in Atlanta, agrees.
<br />"He needs to make himself a lot better-known," Black said. "He's certainly not a household word. . . . At this stage, he would need to sell himself to prominent, influential Democrats in other parts of the country who can be his advocate."
<br />Bayh gets points from political activists and observers for being telegenic and a smooth speaker. But he hasn't shown that he can excite a crowd, some say.
<br />Bayh's keynote address at the 1996 Democratic National Convention was viewed by many conventioneers as a good time to hit refreshment stands. Contrast that to Barack Obama's keynote speech this year, which made the newly elected Illinois senator an instant celebrity and even sparked talk of an Obama presidential bid in '08.
<br />"There is a missing pizzazz element to him," Todd said of Bayh. "He's so careful and so wholesome that there's a missing glitz factor. That may be simply because he has not tried to be a national candidate. Maybe once he goes and starts testing the water, that will change."
<br />Running from the Senate
<br />Bayh -- who spent eight years as governor in Indiana -- would have to test the waters from the Senate, which has not been a successful springboard to the presidency since John F. Kennedy's victory in 1960. Four of the past five presidents ran as governors.
<br />Governors can set the agenda in their states while senators cast one of 100 votes on an issue. Bush and other Republicans criticized Kerry for not having a longer list of accomplishments from his 20 years in the Senate.
<br />"As an executive, you have a definitive record of accomplishment to point to," Fischer said. "You can say you've created this program or funded that program."
<br />Democratic governors named as possible 2008 prospects include Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a former Cabinet secretary who is Hispanic; Tom Vilsack of Iowa, who was also on Kerry's short list of running mates; and Mark Warner of Virginia, who also appeals as a centrist. Govs. Rod Blagojevich of Illinois and Janet Napolitano of Arizona also have been mentioned.
<br />To win the presidency, Bayh first would have to win his party's nomination, and that could be tricky for someone trying to steer to the middle. He received low ratings from abortion-rights groups while being considered as a potential Gore running mate. Bayh is particularly criticized for supporting a ban on a procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion, with no exception for the life and health of the woman.
<br />Bayh voted with Democrats this year to block a vote on amending the Constitution to ban gay marriage. While Bayh said he opposes same-sex marriage, he has refused to say whether the Constitution should be amended.
<br />Bayh also could face future Senate votes that might put him in conflict with the Democratic Party, such as on any Bush nominations to the Supreme Court.
<br />But Joe Andrew, former national and state Democratic party leader, said traditional litmus test issues won't be as important to Democrats during the presidential primaries as will picking a candidate they think can win nationwide.
<br />"Bayh trumps virtually any other presidential candidate on the simple test of electability," Andrew said.
<br />Fund-raising prowess
<br />Bayh has shown he can raise money. He had more than $7 million in campaign funds as of Oct. 13, the third-most of any senator. He also has raised $1.5 million during six years through a separate political fund that he uses to contribute to other Democratic candidates and to pay for travel.
<br />Bayh has received the most support from individuals employed by the financial, insurance and real estate industries, which contributed $1.6 million to his re-election fund, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. Bayh's past chairmanship of the Democratic Governors' Association , as well as his role as chairman of the Democratic Leadership Council, which is more business-friendly than many traditional Democratic groups, have helped him build a fund-raising network across the country.
<br />National security
<br />Bayh does not have a military record to bolster his national security credentials. But that's an area he has tried to build on in the Senate. He serves on the Armed Services and Intelligence committees, was one of the first Democrats to back Bush's request to use force against Iraq without restrictions, and has been a strong supporter of a national missile defense system. Bayh also has been part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers pushing for a massive overhaul of the nation's intelligence network, as recommended by the independent 9/11 commission.
<br />Family situation
<br />When Bayh announced in 2001 that he would not run for president this year, he cited his twin boys as the main reason. Bayh said a presidential run would require him to spend too much time away from his then-five-year-old sons.
<br />Asked if family considerations will again be the deciding factor, Bayh responded: "Whatever I do publicly will also have to be consistent with being a good father and being a good husband."
<br />Andrew said Bayh is far from deciding about running, and he still has plenty of time to do so.
<br />Others disagree.
<br />"I think he needs to start fairly soon, and I think he needs to come South," Harpootlian said.
<br />But in New Hampshire, which traditionally has the first presidential primary and whose delegation Bayh visited during this year's Democratic National Convention, Democratic Party Chairwoman Kathy Sullivan said the party hasn't sent invitations for its 2005 fund-raiser, an event that presidential hopefuls will want to attend.
<br />"I think it's a little early," Sullivan said, "for all of us to be talking about presidential candidates."
