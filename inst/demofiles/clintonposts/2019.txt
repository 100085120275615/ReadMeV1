Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer, <strong>City Councilman Simcha Felder</strong>, former presidential candidate Al Gore and former vice presidential candidate Jospeh Lieberman. Williamsburg preservationists also pointed to the Austin, Nichols &amp; Co. warehouse at 184 Kent Ave., which the City Council voted not to give landmark status to in November. As representative of the district, Yassky was the force behind the nonlandmark vote.

Instead, the Kestenbaums and three others were convicted of illegally selling them in the U.S. for a $4 million profit. In the last two years, Yassky has gotten a total $2,100 from Louis Kestenbaum's son, Joel, and $3,000 from two Kestenbaum business associates. Yassky officials said he was unaware of the Kestenbaums' crimes........</em>
