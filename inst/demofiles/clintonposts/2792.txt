<div><p>Strong words from <a href="http://tks.nationalreview.com/archives/091037.asp">Jim Geraghty</a> on &quot;disinformation&quot; being spread about the ports deal by Democrats, who are being disingenuous or even dishonest about, for instance, the extent that foreign companies (including a Saudi company) run our ports already; there's a similar tone in a surprisingly anti-protectionist <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/editorials/la-ed-ports26feb26,0,6772402.story?coll=la-news-comment-editorials">LA Times editorial</a>: &quot;[Sen. Barbara Boxer, D.- Cluelesstan] said last week that she would support legislation preventing any foreign firm, state-owned or not, from buying port operators. Memo to Boxer: 13 of the 14 container terminals at the ports of L.A. and Long Beach, the biggest port complex in the U.S., are run by foreign-owned companies.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Dems apparently see this as a way to get in good with their longshoremen union allies while at the same time sounding like they're genuinely concerned about national security; it's reminiscent of Hillary's call during the 2004 presidential campaign for more $ for &quot;first responders&quot; as a national security priority, which curried favor with the&nbsp; firemen and police public unions, although it's a ludicrous priority if you give it any thought, since <em>responding</em> quickly to a terrorist attack does nothing to <em>prevent</em> it.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Dems also seem to be seizing the opportunity to appear to lean farther &quot;starboard&quot; than &quot;port&quot; for once.&nbsp; &nbsp;The Hilldebeast in particular is deperately in need of some national security credibility if she's going to win in 2008 (to get an idea of the uphill battle she faces, check out the amusing story of the <a href="http://gatewaypundit.blogspot.com/2006/02/hillary-pretends-to-be-hawk-us-soldier.html">forced handshake</a>).&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Geraghty's conclusion is very harsh on the Dems: </p><blockquote><p>The UAE is, in its actions right now, an ally. The Democratic party as a whole appears hell-bent on scuttling this deal, and ruining relations with this ally. For all that partyâs relentless talk about the U.S. needing allies and strong partnerships, they will urinate all over one of our comrades in order to score points against the president. 

However, this is the same party urging us to continue sending aid to the Palestinians, where it can be used by the new government of Hamas. 

The Democratic Party would humiliate, alienate, and punish our allies while sending financial aid to terrorists and sucking up to our enemies. Do not buy into the line that they are pushing. 

</p></blockquote><p>I'll agree with him that the Dems are being protectionist, opportunistic, and hypocritical, and that they are posturing rather than evincing a serious concern with national security.&nbsp; Yet someone can be right for the wrong reason.&nbsp; I'm still uncomfortable with doing any business with the Arab world.&nbsp; I know General Tommy Franks is in favor of the deal, but last time I checked his nickname wasn't Tommy &quot;Machiavelli&quot; Franks.&nbsp; We could be outsmarting ourselves with this deal with the devil.&nbsp; &nbsp;Ultimately I don't know what's best, but I do know I trust the adminstration's judgment better than that of the buffoons in the Democratic party -- which would make it even harder to take if the latter turn out to be right. </p></div>
