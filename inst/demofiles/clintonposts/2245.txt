<span>You lost the election because you nominated Senator John Kerry.</span>

<span>A Northeastern Senator........What were you thinking !!!</span>

<br />Not to take anything away from Karl Rove and the Republican campaign to relect George W., but you nominated a northeastern Senator. Look at recent (post Watergate) presidential election history. Presidents Carter, Clinton, George H, George W., Nixon, and Reagan were all from midwest, western, or southern states. Vice-president Gore, whose nomination didn't provide your party best choice to win the white house, nearly won in 2000 and he was from Tennessee.
<br />
<br />Not convinced? Go back another 30 years to the post WWII presidential election history. Presidents Truman, Johnson and Nixon were from states other then the northeast. The exceptions being Presidents Kennedy and Eisenhower. However, Ike, a career military man with roots in Kansas and Texas, ran as a republican and was a nonpolitical iconic war hero. JFK is the only exception, with historians crediting his victory to Nixon's dark eye shadows during the televised debates and Senator Johnson carrying Texas for the party.
