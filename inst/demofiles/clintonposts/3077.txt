<blockquote>Some are saying that this was a surprise that the Department of Homeland Security could not have possibly imagined. Yet, such a statement is clearly a lie. LSU researchers, Louisiana emergency management officials, meteorologists in the New Orleans area and many others have been sounding the alarm for many years. Along with our congressional delegation, these individuals told the Clinton and Bush administrations that the City of New Orleans needed help with the levees, flood protection and coastal restoration. U.S. Senator Mary Landrieu has filed bills for three years asking for money for coastal restoration in Louisiana. Tragically, it fell on deaf ears until this year when finally 4% of the necessary funding was granted, spread out over four years. Some say a price tag of $14 billion is too much for Louisiana coastal restoration, but our federal government spent $7 billion to restore the Everglades in Florida and billions to restore Chesapeake Bay in Massachusetts, so $14 billion to protect a crown jewel is more than doable, especially when so many lives are at stake.  </blockquote>
