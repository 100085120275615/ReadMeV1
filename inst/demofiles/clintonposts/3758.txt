<div>While the national elections were a bust, all center-left folks can take heart in our improved standing in state legislatures and isolated places in the "red states."  Local politics is where everything starts. They are the hallmark of any good political organization. Oftentimes, they are the face of a party instead of the much followed national politics. The health of any party locally can largely be seen at the roster of local officials. While sometimes state and national politics take center stage, local parties are the true lifeblood of any political party. 
<br />
<br />While the Democratic Party may seem battered and torn, I see a positive future for the party.  The national Republican juggernaut is already starting to crack at the seams.  More and more the national agenda coming out of Ken Mehlman and Karl Rove's offices are manufactured crises, crises that once put under the microscope, fail the reality test.  Time will eventually catch up to the Republican Party even if Democratic strategy cannot. 
<br />
<br />Some day soon the angst over two grown men kissing will be overcome by the lack of quality, affordable health care and good-paying jobs.  The Social Security smokescreen created by Republican spin doctors will be seen for what is, an effort by a newly-elected Republican federal government to transfer our nation's guaranteed public retirement program into the hands of well-heeled, private financial interests on Wall Street.  The war in Iraq, too, will have a timetable for an exit.  Over time, Iraq will have a stable government and be able to stand on its own.  After that occurs, the drumbeat of patriotism which was so at the forefront of many of our nation's center-right voters will fade.
<br />
<br />Much like the Iraq war, the ability of same-sex marriage and abortion to be continuing and lasting issues is in serious doubt.  What the Democratic Party must be able to bring the public's attention to the Republican abortion record.  Do their legislative efforts really <span>decrease</span> the number of abortions or simply pay lip service?  How can everyone work to decrease the number of abortions.  The subject needs to be taken out of its current rights-based framework.  Instead, we must see the issue as a moral one like the rest of the country.  Everyone wants to see fewer abortions.  Why can we not all work toward that goal?  Democrats need to be talking about how to decrease abortion as Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) so artfully did recently. 
<br />
<br />In the years since 1994, has either side honestly been able to critically change the framework of abortion in America?  Not really, some state laws, appointments, sure, though abortion is still legal, Roe v. Wade is the law of the land, and honestly that's not going to be changing soon.  Only when Democrats stop beating their heads against the wall with this issue can we move forward.  While we cannot forget our commitment to abortion rights and ultimately the rights of women to have the ultimate jurisdiction over their own bodies, it's time to take the debate to the next level.  Whereas this is far more easy to say than to implement, we have to change the fundamental structure of this debate.  In an America where morals weigh on all of our minds no matter what our place in the spectrum, we have to look toward making abortion rare.  We must stop the ability of the Republican Party to label us as baby-killers or face our own death as a modern political party, unable to compete in the suburbs of America.  Only then can we hope to have a chance to talk to the real issues of our country.  We must pass the moral smell test and render it a non-issue, so we can begin to put the country in the right direction.
<br />
<br />Same-sex marriage, too, will fade.  While the issue of gay rights will continue to haunt our national conscience, we must move forward.  In all likelihood, all but 10 or 12 states will have a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.   While the Republican Party can continue to beat the drum against same-sex marriage, it will become a non-issue.  With a largely pro-states' rights U.S. Supreme Court (with the grand exception being Bush v. Gore), the ability to legislate marriage policy resides with the states.  Therefore, the true ability to federalize this issue should be nill.  Where are the Democrats pointing to Republican flip-flopping on the issue of states' rights?  While they will continually point to the "sanctity" and importance of marriage to society, why can we not say their ideology shifts with political winds?  The South and West have long had strong traditions of states' rights, why can we not take that issue back to them?  Southern and Western culture have at their core political foundation the concept of states' rights and that should be used to illustrate the Republicans ability to be out of step with Southern and Western voters.  As the South and West continue to change culturally with the influx of new voters from other regions of the United States, those are the voters who must be targeted.  Virginia stands as a shining example.  George Bush won Virginia by only 8 percentage points.  The Washington suburbs are changing the political landscape in Virginia, albeit at a more rapid rate than the rest of the South, it should serve as a model for where centrist Democrats can win.  Therefore even the issue of same-sex marriage as it stands as a state issue should be used to illustrate modern Republican hypocrisy.
<br />
<br />For too long, the Republican Party has been able to have it both ways.  If Democrats are to succeed in the future, we must look to the future.  We cannot get bogged down in a social war or we will lose every time.  We have to be cunning and crafty in how we portray the Republican manipulation of the agenda.  Only then will the American people be able to wake up and see the reality of their current Republican reality.
