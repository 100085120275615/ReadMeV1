Positioning himself on the war is one challenge. (<i>I'ts a challenge for him to position himself on the war? How come?</i>) He also has to figure out how he positions himself with respect to his own 2004 running mate, John Kerry, who seems to have less residual popularity and organization in Iowa than Edwards does. <i>(Sounds to me like Edwards can't make up his mind on anything... why is it that doesn't surprise me?)</i><br /><br />*snip*<br />But Edwards definitely has advantages this time, in addition to experience. From now on, the presidential contest must be evaluated in light of the new rules adopted by the Democratic Party as a result of changes recommended by its Rules Committee earlier this month. Those changes moved Nevada and South Carolina to the first two weeks of the schedule, along with the traditional first in the nation Iowa caucus and the first in the nation New Hampshire primary. So now you have to think in terms of four states, instead of the usual two.<br /><br />Primary politics is all about expectations, and bettering them. One of the obvious beneficiaries of the move of South Carolina should be the man who used to represent the neighboring state in the United States Senate. The question this time around is whether he will be able to do a better job than he did the first time capitalizing on a better than expected Iowa showing in (Nevada and) New Hampshire before South Carolina. That will require going beyond the Two Americas theme, the challenge Edwards has yet to conquer. If he does, watch out.<br /><br /></i>From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/26/politics/26poverty.html?ex=1156910400&en=3e012bf8faee2928&amp;ei=5070">The New York Times</a>: <strong>"With an Eye on Politics, Edwards Makes Poverty His Cause"</strong><br /><br />*Snip*<br />Now Mr. Edwards, a former senator from North Carolina and a presumed contender for his party's 2008 presidential nomination, has made curbing poverty the centerpiece of his work and his political approach.<br /><br />This is his true passion, he said in an interview, and he thinks that voters may be more responsive in the coming years, both because the middle class is becoming less secure and because of a shared sense of fairness.<br /><br /><i>Hoo boy! I haven't got a clue as to what his solution to poverty is; I'm not sure he does, since he doesn't seem to know what his position is on anything else, but my guess would be throwing more of our taxpaying dollars at it. It seems to me that the solution to poverty would be education, a conclusion I have reached by watching people live from paycheck to paycheck. I personally know people who have no clue whatsoever as to how to manage their money. We have gotten them through the month where food is concerned when our gardens are going good. But I have seen these same people eat shrimp and buy fast food at the beginning of the month. Now I have the personal experience of having once been dirt poor, and I promise you during those years I never ate shrimp, nor did I eat out, period! You tighten up and deny yourself and try to set something aside for the last part of the month, otherwise you starve! Simply throwing money at such people does not educate them in how to go about managing their funds. Some of them need to be taught finances; how to write checks and balance a checkbook; etc. Without that knowledge you can throw all the money in the world at them and they will spend it like water and still not wind up with anything. I'm not saying that is true of all poor folks, but it is true of many of them, and I know because I've seen it!<br /><br />As for Edwards, if he is going to be their primary candidate for 2008, I don't think we conservatives have much to worry about. But who can really tell for certain? We still have an enormous amount of people in this country with their heads buried in the sand.</i><br /><br /><br /></i></i><i><i><center><a href="http://photobucket.com" target="_blank"><img alt="Photobucket - Video and Image Hosting" src="http://i69.photobucket.com/albums/i60/munchkin_2/tn_ostriches-Ostrich-Ostriches-1_03.gif" border="0" /></a></center></i></i>
