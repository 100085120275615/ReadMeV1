	<blockquote><p>Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, has agreed to sell his memoir for an advance of more than $8.5 million, according to people involved in the negotiations, making a deal that appears to give him the second-largest advance ever paid for a nonfiction book. </p>
	<p>The book is scheduled to be published in the fall of 2007 by Penguin Press, an imprint of the Penguin Group USA, which is part of Pearson. Ann Godoff, the president and publisher of Penguin Press, said yesterday that the book would present Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s view of the world during his tumultuous 18-year tenure at the Federal Reserve and his vision for the future. </p>
	<p>Mr. Greenspan, who turned 80 this week, served as Fed chairman from shortly before the October 1987 stock market crash through the end of January. He said yesterday that he had already begun work on the book, which he expects to finish by the end of the year. </p>
	<p>&#8216;&#8217;Until the book is significantly complete, I do not plan to engage in significant consulting,'&#8217; he said. &#8216;&#8217;I plan to speak periodically until the book is much closer to completion.'&#8217; Though a ghostwriter will collaborate with him, Mr. Greenspan said, &#8216;&#8217;I plan to do the first draft and the last draft.'&#8217; </p>
	<p>Given that Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s notoriously opaque statements as Federal Reserve chairman sometimes confused even the closest observers of monetary policy, it remains to be seen whether he can write a book that appeals to a large general-interest audience. </p>
	<p>He will need to do so, however, to justify the advance that Penguin offered, outbidding several other large publishers, including HarperCollins and Random House. Assuming a cover price of about $30, the publisher &#8212; which receives about half the price of each book sold &#8212; would have to sell nearly 600,000 copies of the book to recover the cost of the advance, and Mr. Greenspan would not receive any additional royalties until the book sells nearly 1.9 million copies. </p>
	<p>Penguin bought the world rights to the book, meaning that it could recoup some of its costs by selling the right to publish translated editions of the book in foreign countries. </p>
	<p>Ms. Godoff said she was confident that Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s book would appeal to an audience far beyond those in the financial world. </p>
	<p>&#8216;&#8217;I think his life and his career are different from any business luminary you can mention,'&#8217; Ms. Godoff said. &#8216;&#8217;His experience over the last 50 years in international relations, his knowledge of the way the world works in general, and his relationships with everybody important in the world cannot be matched by anyone.'&#8217; </p>
	<p>Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s advance ranks second only to the more than $10 million paid to former President Bill Clinton for his memoir, &#8216;&#8217;My Life,'&#8217; which was published in June 2004. Pope John Paul II received an advance of $8.5 million in 1994 for his book, &#8216;&#8217;Crossing the Threshold of Hope,'&#8217; and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton received an $8 million advance for her memoir, &#8216;&#8217;Living History,'&#8217; published in 2003. </p>
	<p>The New York Post disclosed the Greenspan book deal on Tuesday. </p>
	<p>Ms. Godoff and Mr. Greenspan declined to comment on the amount of his advance. Her three-year-old imprint has published such recent nonfiction best sellers as &#8216;&#8217;Ghost Soldiers'&#8217; by Steve Coll, which won the Pulitzer prize for general nonfiction last year; &#8216;&#8217;Alexander Hamilton'&#8217; by Ron Chernow and &#8216;&#8217;The City of Falling Angels'&#8217; by John Berendt. </p>
	<p>In her long publishing career, Ms. Godoff has won a reputation for paying steep advances to authors and thereby making risky bets that only sometimes paid off. In January 2003, she was fired as the president of the Random House Trade Group, for failing to meet profit targets. </p>
	<p>Robert B. Barnett, the lawyer who represented Mr. Greenspan in the book negotiations, also declined to comment on the amount of the advance. He said Mr. Greenspan was talking with several potential ghostwriters but had not settled on one yet. </p>
	<p>The leading candidate for that position, David Wessel, the deputy Washington bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, said last month that he had talked with Mr. Greenspan about helping him with the book. &#8216;&#8217;While this has been under discussion,'&#8217; Mr. Wessel said, &#8216;&#8217;I've recused myself from editing stories about Greenspan in The Journal.'&#8217; </p>
	<p>Mr. Greenspan, in the 10-page proposal for the book that his representatives circulated among publishing houses, said that he would write about the presidents and other politicians he has dealt with and would discuss a range of issues, from China&#8217;s effect on the global economy to how 9/11 affected his understanding of economic trends. </p>
	<p>&#8216;&#8217;I do not intend to dwell on personality aberrations, except as they affect policy decision-making &#8212; which, of course, always involves personalities,'&#8217; he wrote, according to a copy of the proposal obtained by DealBook, a Web log published by nytimes.com. &#8216;&#8217;I will also describe what it&#8217;s like to be a prop at a Congressional hearing, which is too often the role of witnesses.'&#8217; </p>
	<p>Mr. Barnett said that readers would be surprised at how approachable Mr. Greenspan is in the book. &#8216;&#8217;The person that we watched testifying and speaking &#8216;Fed-speak&#8217; is not Alan Greenspan,'&#8217; Mr. Barnett said. &#8216;&#8217;Alan Greenspan is articulate, insightful and also funny. The proposal that he circulated reflected that, and the publishers he met with saw that. This book will be a highly readable piece of work.'&#8217; </p>
	<p>Susan Petersen Kennedy, the president of the Penguin Group USA, echoed that sentiment. &#8216;&#8217;What I&#8217;m looking for here,'&#8217; she said, &#8216;&#8217;is a book that will sell for the next 40 years.'&#8217; </p>
