<span>Hello Beautiful People.  My name is Echo Steiner. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I am a mother of a beautiful daughter, </span>
<br />
<span>who I did not raise to kill some other mother's child. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I am Co-Chair of the Florida Green Party and the co- secretary of the National Green Party's Peace action Committee. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I am a Military Family Speaks Out member, with a brother in the reserves who has already served one tour in this bloody occupation.  </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I'm a member of  Code Pink, the ACLU, the SDS, and NOW. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I am an election reform activist, and co founder the Palm Beach Coalition for Election Reform, hoping one day we have the tools to run fair, transparent and reverifiable elections, that are not controlled by the corporate parties.  </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>And I am tired of fucking marching..</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>We have marched. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>We have marched in Lake Worth. We marched in Ft. Lauderdale, Miami, West Palm, New York, San Fransisco, DC, and every nook and cranny of this world.  </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>We have sent emails to our elected officials, faxed them, wrote them, and called them.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>My feet are tired. </span>
<br />
<span>My inbox is full. </span>
<br />
<span>My fax is out of Ink.</span>
<br />
<span>And my calls have been unanswered.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I am sick of trying to convince some paid off elected, who the corporate media tells me is a progressive Dem, that the war is a racket. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>FUCK YOU BILL NELSON. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>FUCK YOU HILLARY CLINTON, GO BACK TO YOUR WALMART BOARD POSITION YOU HELD BACK IN ARKANSAS. </span>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span>AND MOST OF ALL FUCK YOU JOHN KERRY AND AL GORE FOR NOT FIGHTING FOR THE ELECTIONS THAT WERE NOT YOURS TO GIVE AWAY.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The movement needs a different strategy.  </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The world cant wait for the Dems to lose another election in 2008 for you to be ready to work for antiwar candidates.  </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>The strategy that many of you have used to vote for Pro war Democratic candidates, in hopes that they will kill a little slower than the Pro War republicans has cost too many lives. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>We must elect antiwar candidates, </span>
<br />
<span>and if your party can not come up with one, or worse yet, in Kuciniches case, when they  refuse to support them,</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>then you must vote your HOPES NOT YOUR FEARS.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Mario Savio, a voice from this country's Free Speech movement said âconscience is the court of last resort." </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>How did your conscience feel when you voted for Kerry?  And hows it gonna feel when you vote for Hillary, who currently is calling for a troop increase of 80,000 while our own rabid warmongering  president is talking about reductions?</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Mario also said...</span>
<br />
<span> "There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part, you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies on the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop! And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all!" </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>So I am sick of fucking marching.  </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>I am sick of seeing you folks, many who I love and admire, break my heart again and again, by marching away from the rally and marching into a booth to vote for a prowar candidate.</span>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<span>I think its time those of us who will not accept a war candidate begin to put our bodies on the gears and upon the wheels.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>It's time that we attack this so called two party system and refuse to touch the black box screen of any more millionaire bomb throwers.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Its time to get antiwar candidates elected, </span>
<br />
<span>WE DID THAT IN LAKE WORTH, </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>AND NOW LAKE WORTH HAS THE MOST PROMINENT ANTIWAR ELECTED OFFICIAL IN PALM BEACH COUNTY AS OUR MAYOR. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>AND ON MARCH 28, CARA JENNINGS ANTI WAR ACTIVIST, </span>
<br />
<span>FOUNDER OF THE RADICAL CHEERLEADERS MOVEMENT. </span>
<br />
<span>WILL CARRY OUR VOICE LOUDER TO LAKE WORTH AND BECOME </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>OUR NEXT ANTI-WAR ELECTED OFFICIAL.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>STOP MARCHING AND START SITTING DOWN, GETTING ARRESTED, AND VOTING PEACE OR YOU ARE JUST WORKING AGAINST YOURSELF AND SLOWING THE REST OF US DOWN.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>WE NEED YOU 365 DAYS A YEAR, NOT JUST ON MARCH 19TH. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>WE MUST SHUT THEM DOWN!</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>VOTE PEACE! VOTE CARA!</span>
