<div>Sorry folks. You're in for another two weeks of lame blogging before we have what should be a monthlong extravanganza of blog worthy adventures in Chi-town.<br />
<br />Here's a funny thing I was forwarded from my pops-it was sent without attribution, so I cannot tell you from whence it came.<br />
<br />It's about Barack Obama, so I wager only Brownsox will read it to the end.<br />
<br />BARACK OBAMA AT THE GRIDRON DINNER - HILARIOUS AND DEADLY<br />
<br />Senator Barack Obama not only has impeccable timing, but the freshman<br />Democratic senator from Illinois also can sing. And at the annual<br />dinner of The Gridiron Club, Obama took the spotlight at to poke fun at<br />the Bush administration, lampoon Vice President Dick Cheney's hunting<br />mishap and even take a few pokes at himself and his own party. He<br />rolled it all out with extraordinary ease and unloosed a song to boot,<br />sung to the tune of "If I Only Had a Brain,'' with the punch-line<br />landing on John McCain.<br />
<br />Obama,opened with a show of pleasure for the "extravaganza'' of the<br />evening, attended by Bush, Cheney, half the Cabinet, Chief Justice John<br />Roberts Jr., the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and a cast of<br />media stars. "Men in tails. Women in gowns,'' Obama marveled. "An<br />orchestra playing, as folks reminisce about the good old days. Kind of<br />like dinner at the Kerrys'.<br />
<br />"Nice to see you, Mr. President and Mrs. Bush,'' Obama said to the<br />president seated to his right and first lady to his left. "I think it<br />takes a great spirit for the president, who we all know is an early<br />riser, to sit here until midnight and hear himself lampooned, when he<br />could be back at the White House enjoying a quiet, peaceful night,<br />watching TV and approving secret wiretaps.''<br />
<br />"The truth is, I'm terrified to be here,'' he said. "Not because you're<br />such a tough audience, but because they're serving drinks. I'm standing<br />about 30 yards from the vice president, and I'm a lawyer. The only<br />thing that could make this more dangerous is if he considered me a<br />friend.<br />
<br />"Mr. Vice President, I know you came here expecting to be a target,<br />which, it turns out, may prove easier for you than shooting at one,''<br />said Obama. "But I do want to thank you. For years, we Democrats have<br />succeeded in doing little more than shooting ourselves in the foot.<br />You've taught us a valuable lesson,'' Obama told Cheney. "Aim higher.''<br />
<br />"There's probably only one person more sick of these jokes than you,<br />and that's your wife,'' Obama continued. "It's an honor to share this<br />stage with Lynne Cheney - a great personage in her own right. Scholar.<br />Author. A few years ago, she wrote a book called, Telling the Truth, or<br />as they call it in the vice president's office, Telling the truth - 24<br />hours later."<br />
<br />Obama noted the absence of Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice: "You<br />know, the president promised a muscular foreign policy. And anyone<br />who's seen the Condi Rice workout tapes knows he means business.<br />
<br />"This appearance is really the capstone of an incredible 18 months,''<br />Obama said, turning to his own brief career in the U.S. Senate. "I've<br />been very blessed. Keynote speaker at the Democratic convention. The<br />cover of Newsweek. My book made the best-seller list. I just won a<br />Grammy for reading it on tape. And I've had the chance to speak not<br />once but twice before the Gridiron Club. "Really, what else is there to<br />do?'' he asked. "Well, I guess I could pass a law or something.<br />
<br />"About that book, some folks thought it was a little presumptuous to<br />write an autobiography at the age of 33,'' the senator said. "But<br />people seemed to like it. So now I'm working on volume two - the Senate<br />months. My remarkable journey from 99th in seniority to 98th. "Believe<br />me, when you're the last guy to ask questions at every committee<br />hearing, you have plenty of time to collect your thoughts,'' he said.<br />"Especially when Joe Biden's on the committee.<br />
<br />"I'll tell you, my recent Grammy was a big surprise. I thought, for<br />sure Jack Abramoff would win for his rendition of 'It's Hard Out Here<br />for a Pimp.' This whole ethics thing has been an adventure,'' said<br />Obama, cast by his party to help seek ethical reforms in the aftermath<br />of the Abramoff scandal. "I was really excited when they asked me to be<br />the lead Democratic spokesman. But I don't know. Turns out, it's a<br />little like being given the Kryptonite concession at a Superman<br />convention. I mean, how did I know it was a freshman hazing? Maybe I<br />can explain it this way:''<br />
<br />And with that introduction, the band struck up a familiar refrain from<br />The Wizard of Oz, and Obama proceeded to sing from the podium, with a<br />steady, unflinching, and even in-tune delivery of a song about the<br />senator from Arizona with whom Obama recently shared a rough-edged<br />exchange of letters:<br />
<br />"I'm aspiring to greatness, but somehow I feel weightless.<br />A freshman's sad refrain.<br />I could be a great uniter, making ethics rules much tighter,<br />If I only had McCain.<br />
<br />"I could bring us all together, no storm we couldn't weather.<br />We'd feel each other's pain.<br />Red and blue wouldn't matter, party differences would shatter,<br />If I only had McCain.<br />
<br />"Oh why is it so hard, for honest men of good will to agree.<br />If we ever found a way to strike a deal, would we survive. politically?<br />
<br />"When a wide-eyed young idealist confronts a seasoned realist,<br />there's bound to be some strain.<br />With the game barely started, I'd be feeling less downhearted,<br />If I only had McCain.<br />
<br />"Still I hope for the better, though I may rewrite my letter, cause I<br />gotta have McCain.''<br />
<br />Obama offered an unnecessary apology for his solo performance:<br />"Needless to say, my Grammy was in the spoken word category.<br />
<br />"I should say that I really do get along well with Sen. McCain,'' Obama<br />told the hotel ballroom. "But as you know, not everyone in politics<br />does. Because of his superstar status, his virtuous image, the kind of<br />hero worship treatment he gets from all of 'you, some of my colleagues<br />call John a prima dona. Me? I call him a role model. Think of it as<br />affirmative action. Why should the white guys be the only ones who are<br />over-hyped?''<br />
<br />"By the way, before I forget,'' Obama prodded the media rich audience.<br />"Raise your hand if Karl Rove didn't tell you about Valerie Plame. Some<br />folks say you've lost your investigative intensity. You were a little<br />slow to question the weapons of mass destruction. Maybe got a little<br />used on that whole Valerie Plame thing. But, by God, you brought Dick<br />Cheney to justice, and the world's better off for it. Or, at least<br />Gridiron speakers and late-night comedians were better off for it.''<br />
<br />Turning on his party, Obama said: "You know, the Gridiron Club is an<br />aging institution with a long, proud history, known today primarily for<br />providing a forum for jokes. To some,'' he said, "that may sound like<br />the Democratic Party.<br />
<br />"You hear this constant refrain from our critics that Democrats don't<br />stand for anything. That's really unfair,'' he said. "We do stand for<br />anything. Some folks say the answer for the Democratic Party is to stop<br />being so calculating and start standing up for principle,'' he said.<br />"In fact (Senate Minority Leader) Harry Reed's appointed a task force<br />to study this option.<br />
<br />"The Republicans have been poking fun at Democrats for not being united<br />behind a single voice in our party,'' Obama said. "I think that's<br />unfair, and it smacks a little of sexism. And just because the leading<br />voice in our party is a strong-willed, outspoken liberal woman with a<br />famous husband does not mean the Democrats are adrift.. And I, for one,<br />want to thank Barbra Streisand for her great leadership.<br />
<br />"I'm sick of people attacking Democrats as being out of touch, saying<br />we lose elections because we're all a bunch of snobby intellectuals who<br />can't speak the common man's language,'' he said. "I mean, what kind of<br />a supercilious argument is that?<br />
<br />"Take John Edwards. He's leading a new war on poverty - from his Chapel<br />Hill estate. And he's educating us. I had no idea there was so much<br />poverty in New Hampshire.''<br />
<br />"Speaking of New Hampshire, a lot of speculation that that 2008<br />campaign could come down to Sen. McCain and Hillary Clinton. The thing<br />I don't think people realize is how much John and Hillary have in<br />common. They're both very smart. Both very hard-working. And they're<br />both hated by Republicans.''<br />
<br />"I mean, wow, it really has been a rough period for you, Mr.<br />President,'' Obama said. "I missed the Oscars, so when I picked up the<br />paper the next morning and saw Crash in the headlines, I just assumed<br />it was another Bush poll story.<br />
<br />"And how about that ports deal?'' he added, with a reference to the<br />attempted takeover of several U.S. port operations by an Arab firm and<br />a shot at Bush's experience with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina..<br />"I feel for you, sir. It's tough getting trapped in a storm, when no<br />one comes to help.''<br />
<br />"And then there's the flap about global warming,'' Obama said. "You<br />know, the Bush administration's been a little skeptical about the whole<br />concept of global warming. It's actually not the warming part they<br />question. It's the globe.. The president was so excited about Tom<br />Friedman's book, The World is Flat. As soon as he saw the title, he<br />said, 'You see? I was right.'''<br />
<br />"But when people say the administration is hostile to science, that's<br />really a bad rap. Just last week, they asked for a hundred million<br />dollars for the NIH to fund new research into leech therapy.<br />
<br />"I was told that this dinner is off the record,'' Obama said, moving on<br />to the National Security Agency's warrantless domestic eavesdropping in<br />search for terrorists. "No taping or recording of this event, unless,<br />of course, secretly authorize by the president. I completely trust the<br />president with that authority, by the way. But just out of an abundance<br />of caution, and not implying anything, I've asked my staff to conduct<br />all phone conversations in the Kenyan dialect of Luo.<br />
<br />"Truth is, this domestic spying has all kinds of useful applications<br />for homeland security,'' he said. "And I have a suggestion in this<br />regard, Mr. President: you can spy on the Weather Channel, and find out<br />when big storms are coming.<br />
<br />"You all watch the winter Olympics?'' he asked. "I'm sure a lot of us<br />in politics were following that figure skating, because we can identify<br />with performers who spin wildly and sometimes fall on their butts. I<br />also enjoyed that biathlon, where they ski and shoot at the same<br />time.Probably not your sport, Mr. Vice President.''<br />
<br />Obama closed with thanks for all the celebrity he has found during his<br />brief tenure. "Most of all, I want to thank you for all the generous<br />advance coverage you've given me in anticipation of a successful<br />career,'' he said. "When I actually do something, we'll let you know.''</div>
