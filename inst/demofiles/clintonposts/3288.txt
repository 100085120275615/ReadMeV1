<div>In my circle of friends, I have become the political expert and am frequently asked questions.  Recently, a friend asked who would win New York in a hypothetical 2008 Hillary Clinton-Rudy Giuliani matchup?  I didn't have an answer.  Now, courtesy of <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/%7Er/PoliticalWire/%7E3/10032502/clinton_would_lose_in_new_york_to_giuliani_and_mccain.html">PoliticalWire</a>, I do: "One more interesting item from yesterday's <a class="blines3" href="http://www.siena.edu/sri/results/2006/06_Aug_NYPoll.htm" target="_blank" title="Link outside of this blog">Siena Research Institute poll</a>: In a hypothetical 2008 presidential match-up, Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) would lose her home state to both Rudy Giuliani (R) and Sen. John McCain (R-AZ).<br />
<br />Giuliani would beat Clinton, 48% to 42%, while McCain would win, 46% to 42%."<br />
