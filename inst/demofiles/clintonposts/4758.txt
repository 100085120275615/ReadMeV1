<p>Take a step back and take a look at the Big Picture of American life and society. Imagine for a moment the following scenarios. For the World Series of Baseball, there are only 2 teams, the Florida Marlins and the Minnesota Twins; for the Super Bowl of Football, the Buffalo Bills and the Carolina Panthers; for the Stanley Cup of Hockey, the New York Rangers and the Los Angeles Kings. &quot;Hogwash!&quot;, you say. &quot;It doesn&#8217;t make any sense to have just 2 teams. Who would I root for?&quot; Who, indeed; but, for each year you would either have to select a team to root for or you would remain a disinterested party.</p>
<p>Why should we be any more resigned to accept a 2-party political system? &quot;Well, that&#8217;s different,&quot; you may say. &quot;Politics isn&#8217;t a game.&quot; Oh, but it is. It is a game several times greater in magnitude to sports competitions because oftentimes it involves issues of life and death, but it nonetheless is a game, played by professional politicians, coached by political advisors and consultants, and called&#8211;play by play&#8211;by political commentators on a daily basis. And the sole goal of the game of Poliball is Power, achieved through Party victory, with victory defined as winning elections.</p>
<p><a id="more-24"></a>Poliball is played daily through <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=rhetoric" title="Definition">rhetoric</a>, which each side&#8211;Democrat and Republican&#8211;uses to strike an intellectual-blow against its opponent. Notice that neither side usually finds fault with anything that happens within its side, but always finds fault with everything that happens within the other side. There is barely a glimmer of independent analysis of the day-to-day actions of our government or of its officials, which is not a mistake, but a concerted effort on both sides to force a divide among us, the people.</p>
<p>Look, for example, at the Iraq War, which just had its 3-year anniversary and which has its proponents and opponents. The rhetoric from the proponents would have you believe that this is the greatest and noblest undertaking this country has involved itself with since World War II. On the flip-side, the opponents would have you believe that this is the biggest blunder ever undertaken by an American administration.</p>
<p>But the question that needs to be asked is: What do you think? President Bush has embarked on a whirlwind tour devoted to speeches on the need to stay and continue the fight. From his perspective, it is a good fight, but is the argument proffered by the President part of Poliball? The President is blaming the media for painting too drab a picture of what is happening on the ground in Iraq. The Vice President recently stated that his previous statements calling the insurgency in its &quot;last throes&quot; were realistic assessments. Realistic to whom?</p>
<p>If one were to take just the Administration&#8217;s advocated position or rhetoric concerning what is happening in Iraq and what was happening down in New Orleans during and after Hurricane Katrina, one would be hard-pressed to find anything wrong with the Administration&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<p>However, as everyone now knows, the pictures that came out from New Orleans, the pleas by the people and the pleas by the press were broadcasted and plastered in print across the world. We were watching the pictures on television, in real-time, as government officials of both parties immediately started to play Poliball.</p>
<p>If the images that came out of New Orleans portrayed the real story as to what was &quot;happening on the ground,&quot; despite everything the professional Poliballers were telling us, why would the images coming out of Iraq be any less real, or any less accurate in its reflection of what is happening on the ground there?</p>
<p>Proponents of the war complain of the mainstream media, but the complaints only began to surface once the media started presenting images and stories that went against the rosey-view of war. Who can forget the start of the war back in March 2003, when every news organization across the world had people in Baghdad and its surrounding environs, and American television and print were beset with wall-to-wall coverage from embedded reporters?</p>
<p>At that time, there were 2 reporters who were chastized for their coverage. Paul Arnott of CNN, who was fired for talking about his perception of American sentiment for the war, and Geraldo Rivera of FoxNews, who was &quot;relieved&quot; from his Iraq post and brought back to the United States for a spell because he drew lines in the sand that were allegedly supplying the enemy with American troop positions. Ironically for these 2 men, there were no stories subsequently establishing the fact that either of their actions resulted in any American casualties, but they received the wrath of the American public nonetheless.</p>
<p>Is it un-American to voice opposition to a policy of an American President? No, it is not un-American, and the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.billofrights.html#amendmenti" title="U.S. Constitution">First Amendment</a> guarantees that &#8220;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.&#8221;</p>
<p>The danger present in our current society is not so much the Poliballers, who by their nature must act to divide us into camps. The danger lies more so within ourselves. Many people no longer take an interest in discerning facts for themselves, but rely rather on others to tell them. And, more and more often, people are relying on cable-news poliballers. We must remember to act outside of the myopic view presented by the Poliballers.</p>
<p>Case in point, identify the political party that is most likely associated with this statement: President Bush was wrong when he . . .</p>
<p>For the most part, the usual response would be that the speaker was most likely to be a liberal or Democrat. However, when the sentenced is finished with, . . . nominated Harriet Meiers, or . . . supported the ports sale to Dubai, or . . . states that torture is a necessary tool in fighting terrorism, the answer is no longer so simple.</p>
<p>The problem with team-oriented thinking when applied to American politics is that this kind of thinking serves the interests of the Poliballers who do not want you to think for yourself. Their interests are best served when they define the issue and force you to concede that &quot;you are either with us or against us,&quot; leaving you very little room to decide for yourself. The current state of American politics, as played by the Poliballers, presumes you are too stupid to figure things out for yourself and that without them, you will have to live with the other side in power.</p>
<p>The only way of assuring that the Republic lasts for another 200 years is for the American people to think clearly and independently. Is a conservative who opposes the President a Bush-hater? Is a liberal who opposes a Democratic position&#8211;if there was one&#8211;a liberal-hater? Are Joe Lieberman and Hillary Clinton liberal haters because they are for the war? Are Chuck Hagel and Peter King conservative haters because they oppose the war or oppose the Dubai-ports deal?</p>
<p>It is time to open up the floodgates of American politics and allow fresh new faces and voices to flush into the political arena. It is also time for the American people to live up to their civic duty responsibilities and to throw off the cape of party ideology. Currently, few states are ever &quot;up for grabs&quot; in presidential elections because the Poliballers can declare a state to be either for or against their candidate.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time to rid ourselves of the archaic electoral college system, which would force candidates to campaign in more states. But the greatest move that the people of this nation can take is to declare themselves Independent. Then, when party politics only affects 40% of the electorate, with 20% on the left and 20% on the right, only then will true leaders emerge, will new ideas be offered, will new thinking on problems affecting the nation be presented.</p>
<p>There should be campaign finance reform, but not the way identified or discussed heretofore. Allow the 2 major parties to raise all the money they can from any source that is willing to support them, and then the government finances candidates outside of the parties with matching funds of the total party spending. If the Republicans receive 1 million dollars and the Democrats receive 800,000 dollars in political contributions, then each 3rd-party candidate receives 1.8 million dollars of government financed support.</p>
<p>By the year 2020, our government will be much better represented and our politics much better improved. It will decrease the influence of lobbyists. It will allow more voices to be heard. It will allow greater freedoms of choice. It will minimize the influence of Poliballers, and it will usher in a government by the people, of the people and for the people.</p>
