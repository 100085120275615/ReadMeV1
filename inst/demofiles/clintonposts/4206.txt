The latest installment of"Ask the Pilot"on Salon.com (day pass required, but worth it) details a number of incidents that have cost airlines hundreds of thousands of dollars sinceLieberman lost to Lamont in CTthe British arrests resulting in our escalation from Big Bird to Ernie.  Here&#8217;s my favorite:On Aug. 19, a Delta Air Lines jet made an emergency landing in San Antonio, Texas, because &#8212; brace yourselves &#8212; a passenger spent an unusual amount of time in the lavatory. According to flight attendants, the bathroom&#8217;s ceiling panels had been moved and the smoke detector tampered with. The man, a resident of San Antonio, was detained and questioned &#8212; including a physical search of his home &#8212; before the FBI pronounced him "not suspicious at all." (The decrepit state of lavatories on most U.S. aircraft makes the crew&#8217;s reaction even more overblown, but that&#8217;s a topic for another time.)the last sentence in parentheses is so true, particularly on Delta.  Then there&#8217;s this one:In 2004, a United 747 bound for Los Angeles jettisoned thousands of gallons of fuel into the Pacific and returned to Australia because a discarded airsickness bag was discovered with the letters "BOB" scrawled across it. At its most nefarious, BOB is crew member jargon for "babe on board," but for reasons that defy explanation, the crew mistook the acronym for bomb on board, and went all the way back to Sydney.I&#8217;m all for flight crews being pro-active when it comes to anticipating a shift in the paradigm from "set piece" plays like 9/11 to single-plane attacks, but the incidents outlined in the Salon article are just goofy.  Read them, you&#8217;ll find it interesting and humorous in a very sad way.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2113442006-08-24T14:32:00YatPundit: OK, this article worries me&#8230;2006-08-24T18:23:32Z2006-08-24T18:23:41ZActions have consequences.  That&#8217;s why computer types implement change control and do planning.  Obviously those notions are foreign ones at TSA:Checked luggage strains securityIn an interview with USA TODAY, Transportation Security Administration head Kip Hawley said there has been a 20% surge in checked luggage at U.S. airports since liquids were banned from carry-on bags Aug. 10&#8230;.The sudden increase "puts on a strain that could result in some vulnerabilities," Hawley said. The system that screens all checked luggage for bombs "is being stressed," he said."It&#8217;s the pressure on the system that leads to people saying, &#8216;Hurry, hurry, hurry,&#8217; " Hawley said. "We want our (screeners) to focus on their security job without cutting corners because of volume pressure. &#8230; Anytime you have a system that&#8217;s overwhelmed, that&#8217;s where failure is a concern."Youmight have thought to consider that when you banned liquids from carry-ons, you moron.  Did TSA honestly think that women were going to travel without their shampoo, soap, perfume/cologne, etc.?  Of course there are a lot of roll-abords that are now being checked because of the new rules.  I really hope TSA didn&#8217;t just order the changes to carry-on rules withoutsomeoneconsidering the impact on the rest of the system.  If you&#8217;re going to change a complex system overnight, you have to keep in mind that it&#8217;s going to cost some money to maintain the same level of performance.Even before the Corps of Engineers embarks on a project at home in New Orleans, they&#8217;re required to do an Environmental Impact Statement.  While the ultimate value of some of those EIS documents may be dubious, at the least, they force those looking to change things to think about the consequences.  It appears that TSA has no sort of check in place in this regard.I&#8217;m worried that TSA might be manned by the same kind of hacks that controlledFEMA prior to Hurricane Katrina.  After all, "heckuvajob" Brownie might still be in charge there had it not been for the storm.  True incompetence is often not revealed until after the fact.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2109992006-08-15T09:08:00YatPundit: Why is Kenny&#8217;s Key West allowed to remain open?2006-08-15T14:00:24Z2006-08-16T17:38:29ZPrior to the storm, we regularly read about bars in New Orleans that would have their alcohol permits pulled because they were trouble spots&#8211;fights, drugs, shootings.  Theshootingsearly Sunday morning at Kenny&#8217;s Key West is just the most recent incident in this trifecta for the Metairie bar:A Metairie bar a little more than a block from Lakeside Shopping Center exploded with gunfire early Sunday, leaving five patrons injured &#8212; two critically, including a 17-year-old Harvey girl.The shootings might be the worst violence linked to Kenny&#8217;s Key West since Ivory Joe Guy, 20, of Westwego died May 2005 of multiple gunshot wounds in the hallway of the nightclub at 3012 N. Arnoult Road. In February 2004, Steven Stanford, 23, was shot dead across the street from the nightclub after an altercation inside the bar.JPSOthinksthe latest incidentwas drug-related:No arrests had been made Monday. But Fortunato said investigators are searching for two unidentified men believed to be the shooters. Early indications are that the shooting may have been drug related, he said. The Sheriff&#8217;s Office has not been able to determine who was an intended victim.And let&#8217;s not forget that one of the victims was under legal age and shouldn&#8217;t have been there in the first place.All this raises an important question:  Given the history of the establishment, why is Key West allowed to remain in business?I see two possible reasons:First, we&#8217;re talking Jefferson Parish here.  Unlike black-owned establishments in the city, Kenny&#8217;s Key West is white owned.  It also has three video poker machines, which means the place puts $2000-$4000 cash into the pockets of the owners each week.  That sort of revenue stream is hard to ignore, and also gives bar owners a lot of money to make political contributions.A second (and arguably less insidious) reason this bar remains open despite its sordid past is that it provides a gathering point for lowlife.  Without it, the folks who patronize Key West might scatter to other locations, shooting those up instead.  I hesitate to adopt a "blame the victim" position on these shootings, but when you go to a bar that&#8217;s had two fatal shootings on the premises in as many years, you do so at greater risk to your person than a more sedate establishment.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2108532006-08-14T09:18:00YatPundit: Still smokin&#8217;2006-08-14T13:10:19Z2006-08-14T13:11:12ZWe don&#8217;t get Showtime, so I haven&#8217;t watched "Weeds," but based on this review, I think I&#8217;ll get it on DVD when it gets to that point. Salon previews the show&#8217;s second season:This is what "Weeds" does best: It takes the nastiest bits of domestic life and turns them upside down, showing us the lives we might lead if we chose to loosen up, ignore the naysayers and follow our most genuine urges. Even when Andy takes Shane to see a hooker or Nancy shows up late for dinner and then washes down two aspirin with a beer instead of eating, it offers a little emancipation from conventional expectations of what&#8217;s "normal." This is where "Desperate Housewives" seemed to be headed early in its first season, before it got waylaid by the empty plot twists needed to satisfy the expectations of the prime-time soap.[viaSalon]I&#8217;m glad pay-cable tv series are available on DVD, since there&#8217;s little reason to buy a pay package that includes Showtime for just one or two series.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2104632006-08-08T11:36:00YatPundit: bad news for the SBC&#8230;2006-08-08T16:27:42Z2006-08-14T13:59:22ZIt&#8217;s easy for Fundigelicals toscare off kids:In 2002, the SBC&#8217;s Council on Family Life reported that roughly 88 percent of evangelical children are leaving the church shortly after they graduate from high school. Dr. Frank Page, the denomination&#8217;s new president, says SBC churches need to counter that statistic by finding ways to make themselves more relatable, more pertinent and significant to students before they graduate.Here&#8217;s the part I like, though.  OK, I know this is Agape Press, but look at this graf:Even though Christian students are under attack for their beliefs in many public schools today, Page believes those who are firmly grounded in their faith can have a "salt and light" influence on their peers and teachers. Nevertheless, the SBC president says his prayer is that more churches will begin offering Christian schools, both for families who can and for those who cannot afford such education.They&#8217;re able to write this "we&#8217;re under attack" shit so casually.

On the 5-August edition of the FNC show "Beltway Boys," Mr. Williams said the following in reference to Sen. Clinton:"Now you have Senator &#8212; Senator Clinton, likely Democratic presidential nominee, she hopes."Sen. Clinton has not declared a candidacy for president.  Multiple polls show that Democrats have at best a lukewarm interest in her at the top of the ticket.Mr. Williams continued in the same exchange, saying:"And she understands that the base of the party is concerned, preoccupied, angry over the war."Every major poll indicates that it&#8217;s much more than the "base" of the Democratic Party that&#8217;s "concerned, preoccupied, angry" at the moment.  Still, Mr. Williams continues to use RNC talking points rather than reality for his script.Once again, this is the danger NPR faces by using "correspondents" who are paid pundits for other, highly-biased, news outlets.Love,YatPundit[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2101002006-08-08T11:42:00YatPundit: villifying your opponents&#8230;2006-08-08T15:33:56Z2006-08-08T15:34:05ZIn aninterviewwith NPR, Newark, NJ mayor Cory Booker says:It serves nothing at all to villify someone because of their political party.Would that Republicans felt the same way.

From Crooks and Liars, we get a segment from Scarborough defending himself and his position on Mel Gibson against Laura Ingraham:SCARBOROUGH: &#8230;In this case, I turned from being one of Mel Gibson&lsquo;s biggest supporters to being one of his biggest critics.  Why?  Because it was the intellectually honest thing to do to say I was wrong.And our experiment we delivered Tuesday night was devastating to Mel Gibson&lsquo;s argument.  That&lsquo;s why Laura Ingraham and John Gibson, the apologists for the deliverer of those anti-Semitic smears, are now attacking me, attacking the staff of my show, and attacking law enforcement officers.  It&lsquo;s a shame.They owe us all an apology.  And if they were man and woman to admit that, like me, sometimes they make mistakes, that&lsquo;s what they&lsquo;d do.But in this political environment, it doesn&lsquo;t seem like intellectual honesty is in great form.Of course, had the discussion point been The Clenistm, there would have been no dispute.  Still, it&#8217;s fun to watch a bitch-fight.Thing is, Scarborough indeed does have the high ground.  He&#8217;s not only all over Gibson like red beans on rice for his anti-Semitic remarks, but because he was driving dead-ass drunk.  He was .12, which is dead-ass drunk even back before most states (like CA) tightened their DUI laws and lowered the limit to .08.  Personal beliefs aside, Mel Gibson is a menace and the rule-of-law crowd might want to factor that into their support of him.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2095762006-08-08T09:49:00YatPundit: Brocade acquires McData2006-08-08T13:41:07Z2006-08-08T13:41:16ZThis isn&#8217;t a bigsurprise:Under the terms, McData shareholders will control 30 per cent of the new combined company.

"A breast is a breast  it&#8217;s a sexual thing. He didn&#8217;t need to see that."It&#8217;s the same reason that Ash, 41, who nursed all three of her children, is cautious about breast-feeding in public  a subject of enormous debate among women, which has even spawned a new term: "lactivists," meaning those who advocate for a woman&#8217;s right to nurse wherever she needs to."I&#8217;m totally supportive of it  I just don&#8217;t like the flashing," she says.

The Marine Corps MySpace profile is reaching out to its target audience with streaming video of recruits in boot camp and Marines storming beaches.

Clearly her mental health history prior to killing her children indicated that she&#8217;s is extremely ill:Defense attorneys presented much of the same evidence as in the first trial, including half a dozen psychiatrists who testified that Yates was so psychotic that she didn&#8217;t know her actions were wrong. They said that in her delusional mind, she thought killing the youngsters was right.Some testified about her two hospitalizations after suicide attempts in 1999, not long after her fourth child was born. At the time, the family lived in a converted bus. Dr. Eileen Starbranch, a psychiatrist, again testified about how she warned Yates and her husband not to have more children because her postpartum psychosis would probably return.Yates&#8217; stayed in a mental hospital for about two weeks in April and 10 days in May 2001. Psychiatrists testified that she was catatonic and wouldn&#8217;t eat and that her postpartum condition from Mary&#8217;s birth in November worsened after her father died in March.What concerns me hers is how Rusty Yates, the father of the children, has gotten such a pass from everyone.  Here&#8217;s a guy who had his family living in trailers and finally a renovated school bus.  He got his wife pregnant afifthtime in 2000, after two suicide attempts and a diagnosis of postpartum psychosis.  He left his children in the care of a clinical psychotic while he went off and did his own thing.  If ever there was a candidate for a vasectomy it&#8217;s this guy.  I&#8217;ve always thought that "Law &amp; Order" stretched things a bit far when they&#8217;d arrest someone for muder and argue "reckless endagerment," but here&#8217;s an excellent real-life case of it.So, now what becomes of Yates?  Hopefully she&#8217;ll become the clinical study subject I advocated she be back in 2001.  It serves no greater good to simply lock this woman up for the rest of her life.  She&#8217;s clearly ill and won&#8217;t get better.I would like to see her moved to a facility where serious research on postpartum depression and psychosis is being conducted.  She should be analyzed, poked, prodded, all but dissected, to find out what made her get the way she is.  I don&#8217;t know if she&#8217;ll ever be able to be properly interviewed about her pregnancies and children, but perhaps that can happen as well.  I don&#8217;t see any of that happening while she&#8217;s in an Texas state institution, however.  Hopefully Texas will recognize the potential for greater good here and get her to where proper research and study takes place.(x-posted to my kos diary)[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2075162006-07-25T10:51:00YatPundit: Holy Cross Update&#8230;2006-07-25T15:44:53Z2006-08-15T21:19:54Z(note:  I&#8217;m cross-posting this to myDailyKos diary, so I&#8217;m back-tracking a bit in the story&#8230;)Astory in the Times-Picayunetoday focuses on the discussion surrounding the potential sale of land in Kenner owned by the Jefferson Parish School Board to Holy Cross School, the Catholic school for boys (grades 5-12) located in the Lower 9th Ward of New Orleans.  The school was badly damaged by the storm, and students completed the 2005-06 school year in portable classroom buildings on the campus.Holy Cross is seeking to leave the 9th Ward.  Their board&#8217;s first overture was to the State of Louisiana, making an offer for the former site of John F. Kennedy High School, a public school located in the city close to Lake Pontchartrain.  When that deal fell through (there were issues concerning disposal of hazardous waste on the site), Holy Cross began pursuing a two-trackcourse.  The first possible site is that of the former Redeemer-Seton High School, combined with the buildings of St. Frances Cabrini parish.  The Archdiocese of New Orleans owns the property, making this sale a private transaction.  The second possible location is Kenner tract.  Because it&#8217;s public land, the JP School Board would have to approve the sale, and the members aren&#8217;t all convinced it&#8217;s a good idea.The quest of Holy Cross School to find a new location presents an excellent overview of the status of education, public and private, in metro New Orleans since the storm.  Immediately after Katrina, the Orleans Parish Public School system simply ceased to exist.  It had no money, no students, and no employees, as most of the city evacuated and had not returned.  Almost a year later, the school system exists only as a handful of charter schools operating in Algiers, the New Orleans neighborhood located on the west bank of the Mississippi.  The state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education (BESE) hascontrol of most of the public education assets in the city.  There is little hope for returning the city&#8217;s school system to its pre-storm structure, and that&#8217;s not a bad thing&#8211;the OPSS was an unmitigated disaster.  What made it so easy for BESE to take over city assets was legislation passed in 2005 enabling the state to take over schools that were performing so badly that there was little hope of improving them while under local control.  Public education in the city will continue in populated neighborhoods using the charter-school model.One of the things that makes education in New Orleans complicated is that Catholic schools in the area are not merely a private option to residents.  Catholic schools are an entire parallel school system, and one of the primary contributing factors in the de facto segregation of education in the city.  Prior to the storm, there over 120 elementary schools and over 20 high schools in the Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans.  This extensive system enabled white-flight suburbanites as well as whites remaining in the city to avoid sending their kids to school with black children.  In spite of the tribulations involved with restoring public education, Catholic schools were back in session in the city in January of 2006.This is why Holy Cross School is worthy of note.  That the school&#8217;s board of directors is abandoning the 9th Ward is no surprise&#8211;the campus took a terrible hit from the storm, and the neighborhood still looks like a war zone.  Moving to the Redeemer-Seton site in Gentilly is attractive to the school because it&#8217;s still in New Orleans, and acquiring the property from the Archdiocese will be easier than deaing with government entities.  The site will require a lot of work, however, since it was flooded with over twelve feet of water from the London Avenue Canal.The Kenner location is attractive to Holy Cross because Jefferson Parish is where the students are.  The City of Kenner has already passed a resolution welcoming the school.  There&#8217;s only one boys Catholic high school in Jefferson Parish, Archbishop Rummel High in Metairie.  Relocating the school to Kenner would essentially be a continuation of the white-flight that began in the 1960s, accelerated by the storm.Not everyone in Jefferson Parish shares Kenner&#8217;s excitement over Holy Cross, particularly the Jefferson Parish School Board.  Studies indicate that the parish&#8217;s population will grow to between 425K-451K, which is a serious increase over the Census Bureau&#8217;s 411K guesstimate.  An additional 40K residents means between potentially 7K-8K new public school students.  Several of the board&#8217;s members are concerned about from where the money to expand their schools to accomodate new students will come, and are hesitant to sell valuable property to a private entity.  There is a bit of classic Jefferson Parish political squabbling at work here as well&#8211;the board members against or on the fence about the Holy Cross sale are from the west bank; Kenner is on the east bank.The future of education in metro New Orleans is critical to the rebuilding of the city.  Any New Orleans family that had children in Orleans Parish public schools prior to the storm has little to no motivation to return home.  Parents would be doing their families such a huge disservice to pull them out of schools that are by far leaps and bounds better than anything in New Orleans.  It&#8217;s going to take several years to determine whether or not the charter schools on the west bank will be a success.  That leaves Catholic schools and suburban public schools to carry the bulk of the burden of educating the metro area&#8217;s children.  Both systems must be nurtured and funded to keep the city alive.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2071912006-07-24T18:25:00YatPundit: so, does this apply to catlick families, too?2006-07-24T23:19:36Z2006-08-22T16:25:40ZI&#8217;ll have to ask my friend Jerry if he wants to volunteer one of his nine kids as a suicide bomber.

We lost a lot because of the storm, and this is his top list.  I&#8217;ll leave you to look back at the article itself for his comments and reasoning:7. New Orleans Centre.6. Dixie Beer.5. Harrison Avenue.4. Streetcars.3. Charity Hospital.2. Downtown Bay St. Louis.1. West End/Bucktown.I&#8217;m in agreement with Laborde on items 2 through 6, but I have problems with his reasoning on 1 and 7.New Orleans Centre (#7):  That shopping center was dead long before the storm.  The only active part of the mall was the food court, which serviced the medical district, city hall, Entergy, and the buildings on Poydras across the street.  The mall lost one of its main anchors (Lord &amp; Taylor) years ago, and the smaller shops were folding up regularly.West End/Bucktown (#1):  Methinks Errol has fallen into a time warp.  Katrina didn&#8217;t destroy Bruning&#8217;s, Hurricane Georges did in 1998.  Sure, they moved into the building in front of the original restaurant after the storm, but Laborde&#8217;s wistful memories of sipping a beer and watching the fish in the lake were gone years ago.I&#8217;ve got a real problem with a writer who purports to be an "expert" on New Orleans who makes such glaring errors.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2064582006-07-24T12:52:00YatPundit: LA-02:  Still a wait-and-see&#8230;2006-07-24T16:46:21Z2006-07-24T16:46:30ZNo established pol wants to take on William Jefferson (D-LA), he of the $90K in his freezer.  Jefferson who is currently under investigation by the FBI, vehemently denies all accusations of wrongdoing and firmly refuses to step aside, even though he&#8217;s been removed from a key committee position by the Dem caucus.The Times-Picayune hassuggestedtwo possibilities why candidates are reluctant to challenge Jefferson, even though the national party clearly views him as damaged goods:  Money and community status.Money is a serious factor for any challenger to Jefferson.  He only has $325K in his warchest, but raising even that amount in post-K New Orleans will be tough.  The RCCC probably won&#8217;t touch declared GOP candidate Joe Lavigne, given the troubled incumbents they have to defend, so even he will have fundraising problems.  He&#8217;s got $200K, but seriousname recognition issues.  Not to mention he&#8217;s a white Republican in New Orleans.Community status is also significant.  Second only to the late Ernest N. "Dutch" Morial, Jefferson&#8217;s position in the black community is huge.  His influence on the local political scene is larger than life.  While it was easy for Leader Pelosi to throw him under a bus to further the cause of returning the House to Democratic control in the fall, it&#8217;s not so simple back home.Da Paper understates Jefferson&#8217;s influence in the community, though.  It&#8217;s not just that he&#8217;s an icon.  His longevity has enabled him to place friends and family in influential positions across the political landscape.  All federal appointees from Louisiana during the Clinton years owe their positions in part to Jefferson.  For example, Jefferson got his law partner Eddie Jordan appointed as US Attorney, which enabled Jordan to run for Orleans Parish District Attorney, his current gig.  Jefferson clan members are so entrenched in local government that a candidate would challenge the patriarch at her peril.Should Jefferson step aside, the list of challengers is extensive.  The one person who could gear up quickly for a short-notice campaign is City Councilman Oliver Thomas, but he&#8217;s always expressed much more interest in being Mayor.  Of course, nobody&#8217;s ever thought of LA-02 as an open seat, so Thomas may surprise everyone.  Congress is the best path for a black career politician in New Orleans, because there are no term limits.  It&#8217;s all but impossible for a black politician from the city to successfully run statewide.  Running in LA-02 is essentially the same as running citywide, so it&#8217;s either Congress or the bench.There are three weeks to go before qualifying for the Nov. 7th primary.  It&#8217;s unlikely that the DoJ will move on Jefferson in that timeframe, so it remains to be seen if a Democrat will step up to challenge him.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2061592006-07-24T10:49:00YatPundit: trial by public opinion&#8230;2006-07-24T15:43:22Z2006-08-14T14:56:21ZThe nurses charged with murder in the Memorial Hospital case have gotten themselves some smart attorneys.  They&#8217;re obviously not going to let the prosecution be the only ones with their side in Da Paper:Katrina nurses called victims of justice&#8217;Their performance has always been exemplary&#8217;Sunday, July 23, 2006By Jeffrey MeitrodtEvery Thanksgiving, Cheri Landry gets a card from Marian Busse, who can never get through the holiday season without remembering the nurse who helped save her son&#8217;s life in 1990."At Thanksgiving, our family is always together, and I am always thankful that we are six people and not five people," said Busse, whose son Laurence was given a 3 percent chance of surviving the burns that covered his body after a fiery car accident on St. Charles Avenue. "Without her, I am not sure we could have survived as a family. I know my son would not have survived had she not paid such good attention to him."Such testimonials about Landry and Lori Budo, her co-worker at Memorial Medical Center, are flowing in the wake of their arrest on second-degree murder allegations related to the post-Katrina deaths of four patients at the hospital.The article is more than just the stories of would-be character witnesses, it goes after the Attorney General&#8217;s case as well:Attorney General Charles Foti has accused the nurses and Dr. Anna Pou, a surgeon at Memorial, of deliberately administering lethal doses of medicine to four elderly patients in the hospital&#8217;s acute care unit after Katrina hit last August."This is a homicide; it is not euthanasia," Foti said Tuesday at a Baton Rouge news conference announcing the arrests.Former patients and co-workers said they can&#8217;t reconcile the accusations with the extraordinary work they&#8217;ve witnessed since Landry and Budo went to work at the hospital more than 20 years ago.Moreover, one of the city&#8217;s leading heart specialists said investigators have grossly mischaracterized the physical evidence. Foti&#8217;s investigators suggest their case for murder hinges on the presence in the autopsied corpses of morphine, a powerful painkiller, and Versed, a sedative commonly used during surgery.It&#8217;s hard to figure out what&#8217;s going on with Foti in this case.  As Criminal Sheriff, he&#8217;s never been directly involved in pro-life issues, so his opinions on these haven&#8217;t been all that visible.  There&#8217;s more to this than meets the eye, to be sure, but it&#8217;s so difficult to see what.  The religious forces in the state will want to characterize any euthanasia case as homicide to shut down any legitimization of the concept.  Then there&#8217;s the business of health care.  Memorial&#8217;s pending sale to Ochsner Healthcare might be moving management to throw the doc and these two nurses under a bus.It&#8217;s disappointing to read an article such as this, because it indicates how little the truth can have to do with a criminal case in our judicial system.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)urn:lj:livejournal.com:atom1:yatpundit:2060752006-07-24T08:01:00YatPundit: karma bites another one&#8230;2006-07-24T12:55:03Z2006-08-23T02:44:47Z2004&#8217;s Katherine Harris is biting the dust:The votes don&#8217;t add upOhio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell, accused of suppressing votes during the 2004 election, faces daunting polls of his own in his race for governor.By Walter ShapiroJuly 24, 2006 | COLUMBUS, Ohio &#8212; The devastating poll results for Republican Ken Blackwell in Sunday&#8217;s Columbus Dispatch &#8212; showing him 20 points behind his Democratic rival in his bid to become the most conservative big-state governor in modern times &#8212; would try the faith of any candidate. Instead, Blackwell spoke passionately for more than a half-hour Sunday morning to the congregation at the Pentecostal Potter&#8217;s House Church of God as he testified to his Christian faith and to his belief in a thin permeable membrane separating pulpit and politics.I&#8217;m always amazed when reporters write about Republicans and race:Not too long ago, Republicans had a dream of confounding the racial contours of American politics by electing conservative African-Americans as the governors of Ohio and Pennsylvania (former pro football great Lynn Swann, also trailing by double digits in most polls). Prejudice appears to have little to do with Blackwell&#8217;s political problems, since as he proudly notes he soundly defeated his white primary challenger, Attorney General Jim Petro. Asked about Blackwell in an interview earlier this month, GOP national chairman Ken Mehlman said, "Voters want change in that state &#8230; and Ken Blackwell, through his biography, his record of accomplishment and his platform, radiates change."Blackwell did beat Petro fairly handily, 56%-44%, but the OH primary had low turnout and the high-profile preachers such as Rod Parsley threw their support behind Blackwell as payback for putting all the voting machines in precincts where Parsley&#8217;s congregants live rather than where the black folks live.  Not to mention the fact that Blackwell is still the state&#8217;s chief election official, so he essentially counted his own ballots.General elections tend to be quite different from closed party primaries, however.  More voters than the church-going faithful will be out in November, and the polls are reflecting this.  For all the GOP machine might protest that their party is colorblind, there&#8217;s always a racial undercurrent, a segment of voters who are "under the radar."  They&#8217;ll never admit to rejecting a candidate because of his race, but they still vote color.I would love to believe that OH voters are smart enough to see that the GOP has become totally corrupt in their state, and that Blackwell is one of the poster children for what is wrong with elections in this country, but Occam&#8217;s Razor applies here as well.  The simple explanation here is that conservative white voters don&#8217;t vote for the Eebil Coloreds.  It happened here in Louisiana, in the Blanco-Jindal race.  Kathy Blanco would be considered a DINO by most liberal Democrats, with a platform that wasn&#8217;t all that different from her opponent.  Bobby Jindal is a Republican darling, but his Indian (as in the country) heritage and dark skin made him just another Colored Guy in the minds of the average redneck.Given the lack of outrage in OH over the extensive suppression of black voting that Blackwell led in 2004, the notion that race and prejudice aren&#8217;t factors in that state is a no-sell.  Parsley and the other revs have carried Blackwell as far as they can.  Their arrogance that they control the process will be their downfall, as the bigots in their congregations reject their advice and vote for the white guy.[YatPundit](YatPundit entry)
