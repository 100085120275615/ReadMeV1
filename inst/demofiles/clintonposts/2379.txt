<span>In 1996, Bill Clinton ran for re-election on that Godawful theme of âBuilding a Bridge to the 21st Centuryâ or something horrible like that. That Clinton won re-election with such a clunky message clearly proves that he must have been doing a hell of a job. How could anyone vote for a candidate with a tagline like that?<br />
<br />The truth is Clinton won the 1996 election well before the campaign of his opponent, Senator Bob Dole, ever got off the ground. Several months before the election, the Clinton campaign delivered a knockout blow to Dole in the form of tens of millions of dollars in television ads paid for by the DNC. The party saturated the airwaves with positive images of Clinton. And this was in late winter and early spring, when the voters were supposedly not paying attention. Some called the ads a complete waste; who would remember an ad campaign from February?<br />
<br />Obviously, the voters did. Clintonâs knockout blow did not come at the end of the election, it came at the beginning. Dole didnât feel the punch until November, but the damage was done early on.<br />
<br />I use this anecdote to draw a comparison to the current contest for the Democratic nomination in the governorâs race. Congressman Jim Davis, who began the campaign as the clear favorite against state Senator Rod Smith, has failed to deliver any kind of knockout blow to Smithâs campaign. Instead, he has allowed Smith room to maneuver, so much room that we all read this weekend of </span>

</a>
<span>. Now, with less than 100 days before the election, Rod Smithâs campaign continues to build momentum, like a Rockyesque fighter who has taken Davisâ best punches (Grahamâs endorsement) and is ready to deliver his own late-round knockout.<br />
<br />Sure, Davis is still ahead of Smith, any poll can show you that. But Davisâ failure to deliver a knockout blow to Smith, I believe, will prove fatal to Jim Davisâ hopes.<br />
<br />How could Davis have delivered such a knockout blow? Well, all you have to do is look at Charlie Cristâs campaign versus Tom Gallagher to get an example. Charlie has been in front of Tom from the beginning of this race, always setting the tempo. Like any good boxer, Crist continues to jab and jab and jab away at Gallagher, never letting Gallagher get on solid footing. Of course, Gallagher gets to deliver a counterpunch every now and then, but thatâs nothing compared to the damage being done by Cristâs constant jabbing. I believe that Charlieâs preemptive strike this weekend with $1.4 million in televion ads is exactly the kind of knockout punch that will, like Clintonâs strategy, be the knockout blow. Every timetable Gallagherâs campaign had went out the window the moment they heard about Charlieâs buy. Now, while Gallagherâs off balance, Crist will likely hit him with another punch.<br />
<br />Stick and move. Stick and move.<br />
<br />So to answer the question, Davis could have easily knocked Smith so off balance that it would have knocked his campaign out by seizing the race while Smith was locked up in the legislative session. Davis should have out-raised him hand over fist, all the while hitting him with paid media that Smithâs campaign could not have afforded to respond to. Basically, put so much pressure on Smith from March to May that when he got out of session, the whole world would have changed.<br />
<br />Unfortunately for Davis, the Davis campaign did not deliver the knockout punch when it had the opportunity. </span>
