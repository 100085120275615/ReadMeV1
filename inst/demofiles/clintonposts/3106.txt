<div>Hello and sorry I didn't get something in the past few days, but I'm here now.
<br />
<br />With only 7 days left until the election the candidates are hitting the battleground states like crazy, and with that comes more vitriol from the Kerry camp. Senator Kerry will do anything to win this election, because if he doesn't win the past thirty plus years have been all for naught. He's spent that time saying how he's going to be the next JFK from Massachusetts. If he doesn't win, he probably won't run again. Plus, Hillary Clinton is set to run in 2008 and according to Dick Morris, a very reliable source, has said 2008 is her time to run. The fact of the matter is the Clintons don't really like Kerry and are hoping he loses so as to leave '08 open.
<br />
<br />Senator Kerry really can't logically win. He loses voters with anything he says, whether speaking to hawks or doves. His indecisiveness will be his ultimate downfall. He said something funny this morning on <em>Today</em>. It was something to the affect of, "we won WWII, we won the Cold War, and we'll win the War on Terror." I found that very interesting, because we didn't win the Cold War with any of his help. In fact he was someone who worked against us in the Cold War in his days as a radical anti-war activist and then as a liberal in Congress. Do we really want someone like that in the White House?
