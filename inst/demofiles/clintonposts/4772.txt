<p>The Deaniac group <a href="http://www.dpacny.org/">DPACNY</a> has sent out an email to its members asking them to pressure <a href="http://MoveOn.org">MoveOn.org</a> to intercede on behalf of Jonathan Tasini.</p>

<p>"We challenge MoveOn to poll its members. Ask them if MoveOn.org should take a position on the New York Democratic primary race for U.S. Senate," it says. "MoveOn, please keep democracy alive in New York!"</p>

<p>It seems worth noting in this context that MoveOn is hardly an anti-Clinton group, or an utterly left-wing one. It was founded, after all, in the fall of 1998 on a call to "Censure President Clinton and Move On to Pressing Issues Facing the Nation."</p>
        <p>MoveOn has declined to poll its members regarding the U.S. Senate race in New York, despite having done so in Connecticut. The Tasini Campaign is requesting that everyone who has not already done so should contact Move On </p>

<p>By sending email to:</p>

<p>XXX@moveonpac.org<br />
XXX@moveon.org</p>
