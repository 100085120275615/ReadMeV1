<div>The editor of Playgirl came out on TV last week saying she is a Republican and voted for George Bush in the election. She was on Foxnews talking about the fact no one in her office but her was a Republican. As I watched this I turned to my wife and said, âSheâs going to get fired.â<br />
<br />A few days later she was. She wrote into the Drudge report and told him that a leading person at Playgirl told her on the phone, â"I wouldn't have hired you if I knew you were a Republican.â Then he laughed.<br />
<br />Some joke.<br />
<br />When the Catholic church fires people who work for them who are gay, which is behavior against church doctrine, all hell breaks loose. But let a liberal fire a conservative and no one cares.<br />
<br />I know from experience.<br />
<br />I worked in the film industry in the 1980âs and 1990âs. I was an outspoken conservative towards the end, but at the beginning I really could have cared less about politics.<br />
<br />One day after I had just started in the industry I went it to talk to the production manager of a new film I was hired onto and when he was reviewing my resume he saw I once did a lighting job for a Republican show in Washington. He went nuts and called me a Nazi, right there in the studio office in front of everyone. When I said that was uncalled for and wrong he threw the resume at me and said, âGet out, I donât work with Republicans.â He laughed as I got up and left.<br />
<br />Some joke.<br />
<br />Years later I was working on a TV show and was getting harassed for reading The Wall Street Journal and Human Events. After a few days the Gaffer, the chief lighting tech, and a closet conservative, came over to me and said, âWhy donât you put the articles you think would get them thinking on my equipment cart?â I did so and within a few hours people were reading them. Tax Increases , Donât Ask Donât Tell, Nannygate, Hillarycare. The articles attacked the sacred cows of the left and people started debating them.<br />
<br />Then the insults started. I was called a Nazi on the set, the director once took a Polaroid of me and drew horns and a devil beard on it. Lunches turned into political debates about Clinton and why he was bad for the country. (Rather, I said he was bad, the other 99 people at lunch had other thoughts}. At one point the production manager approached me and suggested I cool it. I told him I had a right to my opinions when asked. He said, âAnd Hollywood has the right to keep people like you unemployed.â Then he laughed.<br />
<br />Some joke.<br />
<br />After my stint on the show ended a few crew people told me they were closet Republicans also. But they knew it was no joke and kept quiet. I wonder how many of them are still working in the industry now that Conservatives are fighting back in Hollywood and moving up the chain of command.<br />
<br />Hopefully soon the Liberals will know how it feels to get fired for their political beliefs. In Matworld, <em>that</em> would be funny.<br />
