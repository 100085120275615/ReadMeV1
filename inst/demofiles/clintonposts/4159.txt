<p><i>"I've been trying to go to Iraq with Hillary Clinton for so long. Hillary was trying to work it out, but it seemed too dangerous," the 20-year-old actress says in the September issue of Elle magazine, on sale today.</p>

<p>Lohan says she hoped to emulate Marilyn Monroe, who performed shows for about 100,000 troops in Korea in 1954.</p>

<p>"It's so amazing seeing that one woman just going somewhere, this beautiful sex kitten, who's basically a pinup, which is what I've always aspired to be," Lohan tells the magazine, adding that she would prepare for her trip to Iraq by taking shooting lessons with her security guard.</i></p>

<p>It's unlikely Lohan knows how hot Iraq can get, given that she was recently hospitalized for heat exhaustion during shooting of her latest film.</p>
