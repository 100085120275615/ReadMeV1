More than 400 fans and fashionistas joined VIP guests for the two events and a panel on Poverty, Women and Human Rights. It focused on the success of microcredit loans, which hundreds of millions of women have used to start businesses, and the need to help the 1 billion people who still live on $1 a day or less. There was disappointment in the crowd that several famous winners sent representatives to collect their awards â including actress Angelina Jolie, Queen Rania of Jordan, Sen. Hillary Clinton, and Kerry Kennedy, who founded a human rights center named after her late father, Robert F. Kennedy.
