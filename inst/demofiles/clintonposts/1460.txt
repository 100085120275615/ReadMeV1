<blockquote><p>I think it&#8217;s one of the most covered-up aspects of what&#8217;s happening to the Democratic Party, is how anti-Semitic and anti-Israel the apparent movers and shakers in that party are, and Lieberman is a living testament to it. I mean, let&#8217;s be honest. Let me ask you, Mark, I mean you said you&#8217;re a Republican Jew. How much do you think Lieberman owes his defeat to the fact that he&#8217;s just Jewish at this point in time?</p>

<p>Hah. That&#8217;s funny. It has nothing to do with the fact that he&#8217;s uninspiring, pro-war, uninspired, supports the death penalty, and is buddy-buddy with the current Republican administration. It&#8217;s all because I hate me some Jewish people. (Think I&#8217;m serious? I&#8217;m not. Some of my best friends and close family members are Jewish. My husband is Jewish. My ancestors are Jewish.)<br />
And when I vote against Hillary, it will be&#8230; You got it. Not because I think her health care plans suck&#8230; Not because she&#8217;s got close ties to the Republicans&#8230; And absolutely not because of her stance on the war. It will be because I hate me some women. (Think I&#8217;m serious? I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m a woman. And I&#8217;m not big on self hatred. Or sexism for that matter.)</p>
<p>The people that would have voted against Lieberman because of his religion? Chances are they never voted for him in the first place. I mean please. An anti-semite voting for a man named Lieberman? Yeah, they voted for him last time around. And the time before that. They&#8217;ve just decided that suddenly they couldn&#8217;t vote for a Jewish man <em>THIS </em>time around.</p>
<p>People that say being against the war is being against Israel? They make me sick. People that say that condemning Israel&#8217;s current actions in Lebanon are anti-semitic? They make me sick.Â  Disagreeing with the actions of a state does not equal &#8220;I hate all people of the Jewish religion&#8221;. If it does, how in HELL do you explain all of the Jewish anti-war Democrats?</p>
<p>And if I disagree with America&#8217;s war on Iraq, does that mean I&#8217;m anti-Christian and want to burn Christians on stake?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t demean the term &#8220;anti-semitic&#8221; by using it for political purposes.
