<blockquote>"I sadly predict that if this measure stays in the bill ... the number of abortions will go up, the human and financial costs will go up, and many women will be really out of luck," Clinton said in a Senate floor debate on the bill, which is headed for a close vote later Tuesday or early Wednesday...

<p>Speaking on the Senate floor, she claimed the result of the proposed change in Medicaid rules would leave more poor women without contraception, causing more unwanted pregnancies and therefore more abortions.</blockquote> </p>
