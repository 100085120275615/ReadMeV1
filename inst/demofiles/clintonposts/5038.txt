<span>We Always Knew Preznit Was An Oil Man.. But Did You Also Know He Is All About GAS Too?</span><br /><br />Err natural gas alright, but not the one that emanates from the earth. From the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/whispers/articles/060820/28whisplead.htm">US News & World Report....</a><br /><br />Animal House in the West Wing<br /><br />He loves to cuss, gets a jolly when a mountain biker wipes out trying to keep up with him, and now we're learning that the first frat boy loves flatulence jokes. A top insider let that slip when explaining why President Bush is paranoid around women, always worried about his behavior. But he's still a funny, earthy guy who, for example, can't get enough of fart jokes. <span>He's also known to cut a few for laughs, especially when greeting new young aides</span>, but forget about getting people to gas about that.<br /><br />How nice ehh?<br /><br /><span>Late Night Funnies...<br /></span><b><br /></b> "NASA lost the original film of the moon landing. Did you hear about this? Well,  you know, in their defense, they're not exactly rocket scientists." --David  Letterman<br /><br />"Good news. President Bush had his physical last week, and passed his physical.  No word on the mental. But the doctors say he's okay, but he might want to go on  a diet, because his Body-Mass Index has jumped to 26. On the bright side, his  Body-Mass Index now matches his approval rating." --David Letterman<br /><br />"In a sign of how troubled our world is right now, this year, President Bush  decided he's only doing a ten-day vacation at his Crawford ranch which, really,  why even bother at that point?." --Jon Stewart<br /><br />"[On CNN's "Target: USA" segments] What CNN is saying is we're only vulnerable  everywhere. The danger is strictly limited to geographic locations. You know,  places. We don't want to tell the terrorists what to do. That's coming up next  on the Situation Room." --Jon Stewart<br />"Let me explain something to you about the algebra, if you will, of cable  news: Three-year war in Iraq is less than 30-day-old bombing of Lebanon, which  is less than explosive Gatorade on a plane, all of which is chickens*** compared  to a break in a 10-year-old murder case." --Jon Stewart<br /><br />"Thousands of Lebanese refugees are pouring back into their home towns, and it  seems that one relief organization is stepping up their aid efforts more than  any other relief organization. Which group is it? Here are some hints: They're  Shiites, they're on the State Department's watch list of terrorist groups, and  their name rhymes with 'Lezbollah'." --Jon Stewart<br /><br />"Oh, sure, you can have snakes on a plane, but forget shampoo and toothpaste."  --David Letterman<br /><br />"A lot of folks are big fans of the planets. Pluto now has lost its status as a  planet. But it says it will run as an independent." --David Letterman<br /><br />"You know whose birthday it is tomorrow? Bill Clinton, former President Bill  Clinton. Celebrity birthday, 60 years old. Bill Clinton plans to celebrate the  same way he does every year: he'll have a romantic dinner, some dancing, and  then he'll go home to Hillary." --David Letterman<br /><br /><span>An Audience..</span><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2191/2311/1600/audience.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2191/2311/320/audience.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>
