</a>I had a rap sheet.<br />
<br />This is a scandalous confession to make, and of course having a rap sheet does not mean that I am a rap-per. I am, instead, a softened criminal who desired the  sumptuousness of desserts so powerful that I was willing to do hard time to get some.<br />
<br />It figures, then, that only <strong>I</strong> could have gotten myself arrested over a carton ice cream.<br />
<br />
<strong>How Haagen Daz Put Me On The Chain Gang</strong>
<br />
<br />It was 1986. I was young, carefree, and prone to riding around in an old Rambler with my friend Audrey and her boyfriend Van. The three of us were a formidable team of aimless wanderers, inclined to taking strange neighborhoods at high speeds with music blaring that heralded our approach. Listening to Wham! and The Pet Shop Boys, Prince and Oingo Boingo, we took corners at 700 mph, and ice cream without the funds to cover the pleasure.<br />
<br />Or at least <em>I</em> did.<br />
<br />When we would embark on these outings, Van and Audrey and I rarely had a specific destination in mind. We would more often than not simply go out on a Blast (our euphemism for Joyride) on a moments notice at midnight if that's what the moment called for. "Hey," one of would exclaim after hours of laying around in Vans house playing Atari, "lets go out!" Where? Anywhere. No, <em>somewhere</em>. We'll know when we get there that we got there! Lets go see! <br />
<br />None of really had any money to speak of, as we were three veritably insane shiftless drifters.History advises us what happens when a group of poor, insane, shiftless drifters go out for an unscheduled blast in the middle of the night, right? Why, they get into trouble, of course. <br />
<br />Envision the Keystone Cops meeting Bonnie and Clyde. And Kim. There, now you have it. <br />
<br />On this particular night, blasting away through the streets for destinations unknown, we found ourselves at a 24 hour Jewel Osco store down on California Ave. Why, I don't recall, but it was open and we were curious and in we went. Most likely, someone was bored, and more than likely, that someone was <em>me.</em> <br />
<br />I remember that I was dressed that night, as was common at the time, like Madonna  on speed. I had a penchant (even then) for ridiculously high heels, higher hair, and outrageous clothes (think Boy George Gets Dressed While Blindfolded.) My elaborate makeup, which caused me to look like I had been jumped at a Vancome counter, was extreme as well, but this dramatic playfulness hardly made me appear to be  a <em>criminal</em> type. I was more the nightclub, I'm-off-to-Vegas, lets-have-fun type. In spite of my well coiffed appearance, however, I was about to be labeled a lowly criminal, and all of my outward finery did not betray the fact that I had nary a penny to my name at that moment. But I <em>sure did</em> want that Haagen Daz.<br />
<br />Mmmm. Ice cream. Haagen Daz Vanilla! All I needed was a plastic spoon from the plastic spoon aisle, some audacity, a complete lack of concern for the security camera's overhead, some blind misguided faith, and I was in business! <br />
<br />Prying the lid off and sampling the stolen goods while we wandered through the Deli Department, Van and Audrey laughed and begged me Not To Do It. <em>Don't </em>Kim! You'll get caught! Hearing these admonishments to consider the path I was forever inclined to tiptoe down (although not in a more appropriate trenchcoat and dark glasses) when I thought no one was looking is apparently a recurrent theme in my life. A resounding theme, even.  And of course, as usual, I didn't listen. I soon discovered that this tendency towards rebellious lack of concern for the law was the epitome of folly, a fact which was later confirmed when I found myself in the back of a squad car while Van and Audrey were allowed to return home in the Rambler.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Law According To Jewel Osco </strong>
<br />
<br />Now, as it turns out, there are laws of the land that definitely prohibit eating designer ice cream without the financial means to do so. No matter how good, no matter how cheerful and joyous my experience, there comes that moment when you reach the bottom of the pint sized carton with your stolen plastic spoon, only to find your lip smacking laughter rudely interrupted by a irritable Jewel Osco employee who doesn't find your illegal behavior amusing in any way whatsoever.<br />
<br />It was 3:00am, Chauncey the Store Detective was upon me, and the party was suddenly over. <br />
<br />I recall that he commandeered me during my impromptu ice cream social by grasping me by my criminally inclined upper arm. The arm that had fed me the stolen goods. I was now in possession of an illegal substance, in a quite literal sense, and there was no turning back. With the evidence of Haagen Daaz still evident on my proverbially sticky fingers, I was led away with the Last Words heard by a confectionery bandit of the of the lowest kind.<br />
<br />Excuse me, miss. Will you come with me, please?<br />
<br />Following him to the darkened underworld that comprised the Jewel Osco managers office, I was subjected to an interrogation the likes of which had not been seen since J Edgar Hoover discovered rampant communism in Hollywood. Sitting below a bare lightbulb, sniffling and crying and lamenting that I should have at least stolen some sprinkles and a maraschino cherry if I was going to get into <em>this</em> much trouble, we waited together for the police to arrive.<br />
<br />Chauncey from Jewel (exasperated and intent on getting me 10 to 20): You <em>ate</em> the ice cream, didn't you! <br />
<br />Me (crying and pleading the 5th while I simultaneously talked): It was late, and I was <em>famished.</em> I thought about paying for it, but then I realized I didn't have any money, and then I was <em>sorry</em>! <br />
<br />Chauncey from Jewel (rolling his eyes and sighing): You stuck your tongue out at the security camera and ate the ice cream with an exaggerated flourish while you <em>laughed</em>, miss. You then did what appeared to be a little Stolen Ice Cream Dance in the Dairy Section to entertain your friends while sealing your fate on film. We were all watching you from the hidden monitors and wondering at your insolent stupidity.<br />
<br />Me (regarding him wide eyed and pouting): I just made that dance up tonight, so obviously this wasn't premeditated or anything, right? Who has time to choreograph a theft on short notice?!<br />
<br />Was I really going to get <em>arrested</em>, I then asked pitifully?! Was I going to <em>do time</em>?! Was I going <em>up the river</em>?! Yes, miss, you are. Up the river without a paddle you go. But maybe it's not entirely hopeless. You could try to use your little stolen plastic spoon as an oar if you want. It's yours now, a lovely parting gift fresh from your family at Jewel.<br />
<br />
<strong>Madonna Behind Bars</strong>
<br />
<br />At the police station, I commenced wailing and pleading like  Bill Clinton clinging to the hem of Hillary's skirt from inside the Oral Office. Oh, I am sorry! I was woefully wrong! I never intended to actually eat the ice cream, and in fact I didn't even inhale! I never had relations with that Haagen Daz treat! Well, maybe technically I did, but it didn't<em> mean</em> anything officer! I didn't actually <em>love</em> it (but it sure was okay!)<br />
<br />And just as it takes a village to watch Hillary Clinton"s husband, the police readily decided that it would take a probation officer to watch me.<br />
<br />With my Tammy Faye Bakker makeup now comically smudged admist my tears and sobbing, I realized sadly that there would be no plea bargaining as I was led away to be unceremoniously processed.<br />
<br />Cry us a tsunami, honey.<br />
<br />
<strong>And The Folly Found Me Now</strong>
<br />
<br />Twenty years later, I am an aspiring upstanding citizen. I pay my taxes, vote for Republican's, and always provide money in exchange for my snacks. I have long since retired my Boy George costumes, and although I remain in contact with my good friend Audrey, Van has gone the way of Andrew Ridgely when George Michael reconfigured Wham!<br />
<br />But the police department, I have discovered, has a <em>very</em> long memory, reminiscent of any you may have heard possessed by rogue elephants on the Serengeti Plain. This is an issue, and life is now proving to be much more of a jungle than my status as a Phi Theta Kappa honor student would have led me to understand. You ate the stolen ice cream, and now you'll do your time!<br />
<br />I had been taken to the police station to be arrested, and I was now in the national database of those who have been Found Guilty, which would therefore exempt me from nursing no more than a sugar laden hangover after eating a gallon of Edy's Grand inspired by rampant self pity at this point in time.<br />
<br />In essence, I realize I have a problem on my previously fingerprinted hands, my past having snuck up from behind and bit me on my ice cream slathered rear end. <br />
<br />
<strong>A Criminal Investigation Commenceth</strong>
<br />
<br />Needing to investigate my past criminal history, with little more than the vague recollection of what had happened that fateful night to guide me, I set about researching my dilemma. <br />
<br />
<em>Did </em>I have fingerprints on file? <strong>Had</strong> my picture been on display at the post office? <strong>Was</strong> John Walsh hot on my trail? <em>Could</em> I ever work as a nurse as a former detainee?<br />
<br />I decided to take a trip down to the Chicago Police Department headquarters and find out.<br />
<br />
<strong>One More Time, With Feeling</strong>
<br />
<br />The CPD keeps many <em>many</em> records. They have an archive, I was advised, that dates back to 1960. If you have ever so much as been disorderly on a trolley car or failed to curb your dog, they most likely not only have your fingerprints on file, but your mothers mothers fingerprints as well. And maybe they have the dogs pawprints, too.<br />
<br />To discover the extent of any records they may have had that pertained to me, I consented to being fingerprinted once again, just for old times sake. Bringing me behind an intimidating counter with an emblazoned sign overhead indicating that Chicago's finest was there to help you Access and Review, I allowed my well manicured fingers to be immersed in the black ink of previous crime.<br />
<br />Ew.<br />
<br />While gently rolling my prints onto a white card that carefully delineated which finger was which, I have to admit that I was subtly fascinated and mildly amused by the whole process. Never knowing when to quit and wipe that silly smile off of my face, I felt the sudden urge to photograph the proceedings to post pictures and immortalize my experience, but unfortunately the opportunity was lost for lack of a digital camera. (And <em>here</em> I am getting fingerprinted, and <em>here's </em>my past arrest record appearing on the computer monitor, and <em>here's</em> the police officer getting annoyed with me, and <em>here's</em> me being told harshly to go sit down....)<br />
<br />With ink soaked fingers and no photographic evidence provided for entertainment purposes only, I was exiled to a chair in the corner of the room to await the findings. <br />
<br />
<strong>Expunging The Records Of My Youth</strong>
<br />
<br />Two hours later, it was confirmed. I was on record. I had a <em>rap sheet,</em>and it was in no way related to Eminem. <br />
<br />I stared at the information, shocked and incredulous, for several minutes. May, 1986. I had been fingerprinted, and I was now officially on file in a national database that would forever brand me as one who can only hope to be employed as a Mob boss or teamster. In spite of the fact that nothing even remotely criminal had occurred in the 19 years since then (unless you include a making left turn on red or doing 50 mph in a 30 mph zone), still, there it was. Now what do I do?! <br />
<br />The answer was clear. I now needed to launch an Innocence Recovery Mission.<br />
<br />To do this, I would have to leave police headquarters and go downtown. This was a problem in and of itself, though, as my sense of direction is so skewed that once I am outside of the three block radius that surrounds my house, I require a team of bloodhounds equipped with Northstar tracking devices to help me find my way around. Failing that, I often call my ex-husband, who is at least as helpful as your average bloodhound.<br />
<br />When Mike wasn't available to take my call (shocking), I was forced to embark on this adventure by myself. Driving around in circles, looking for tall buildings to serve as beacons in my own navigationally defunct mind (is that the John Hancock building or something, or is it a high rise Dominick's) I finally spotted an elevated train platform to assist me on my pilgrimage.<br />
<br />Oh, a train! I bet that will take me downtown to fill out papers I know nothing about while I try and talk to an annoyed States Attorney on short notice! Yeah, right. That'll be 60.00 dollars please, and that would merely cover the petition to motion for an expungement of the folly of my youth!<br />
<br />Eating that 3.00 container of ice cream 20 years ago suddenly became very expensive.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Hall Of Marge's Records</strong>
<br />
<br />In the Daley Center, I approached the expungement counter, with all of the other ex-cons, with trepidation. What would I do? Where do I sign? Standing cautiously near men with bold tattoos and bad attitudes, I waited for my turn in shame.<br />
<br />Marge, the official expungement clerk, was not going to allow me to be discreet in my request for service. "Do you have your rap sheet?" she bellowed in her 3 packs of cigarettes a day raspy whiskey voice. "I need to see your rap sheet!"<br />
<br />O-mi-god.<br />
<br />I sheepishly pulled the <em>rap sheet</em>, now carefully folded with great irony inside my book entitled The World's Religions, from inside the pages. I was gonna get me some religious edumacashun, you see, during my train ride downtown to throw myself on the mercy of the court. Thou shalt not steal, right Kim? So you only read nine of the commandments?<br />
<br />Hector, Lashaun, Vito, and Stan all stepped aside gingerly so I could tell the polite and delicate Marge about my crime.<br />
<br />"I, uh, well, I ate some Haagen Daz in a Jewel Osco back in 1986, and they...they took me in," I said quietly.<br />
<br />The boys nearby all laughed and tittered, man, we ain't even <em>that</em> stupid! <br />Trying in vain to disregard them, I whispered "I would like to try and get this record expunged."<br />
<br />"Was it theft, then?!?" Toni boomed as all eyes turned to regard the thief amongst them. "You were guilty! Huh! So now you're on file, and you want to fix it!"<br />
<br />"Yes," I said with quiet exasperation, "that's what I would like to do."<br />
<br />Oh <em>God.</em>
<br />
<br />
<strong>26th And California, Or How Did I Get Here From There?</strong>
<br />
<br />Standing confused and acting on behalf of myself as a pro bono attorney (although I am no relation to the late Sonny Bono)I filled out all relevant documents, petitions, and motions to request a hearing. In this instance, however, it was somewhat more pleasant because the ink was being relayed directly to <em>documents </em>as opposed to being relayed to<em> me.</em>
<br />
<br />19 years, 6 months, and 60.00 later, I finally had my day in court.<br />
<br />I spoke to the States Attorney (whom the presiding judge referred to simply as "State!" which was only somewhat disconcerting) and was assured that my motion would be granted without question. I then waited uncomfortably amongst murderers and bandits and miscellaneous felons to approach the bench.<br />
<br />"Kimberley Riley?!" Judge Intimidator finally bellowed 45 minutes later. "Will you please approach the bench?!" I went forward, head down, dead man walking, clutching my Nine West briefcase full of blues.<br />
<br />"Good morning, your honor."<br />
<br />"Do you have counsel here to represent you, Ms. Riley?!" he shouted whilst scowling, the scoundrels who's cases had gone before me having made him somewhat irritable.<br />
<br />"No, your honor, I do not. I am acting as counsel on my own behalf."<br />
<br />"State?!" he stated excitedly to the attorney beside me, "do you have any objections to her motion for expungement? Is the paperwork complete?!"<br />
<br />"Her paperwork is complete," he answered evenly, "and the state has no objection to granting her motion."<br />
<br />I smiled nervously, unsure if it was perhaps illegal to smile before the bench. I am a <em>damn</em> good laywer. I am Perry frickin Mason! I am Ironsides! I may have been on the wrong side of the law, but I had infiltrated the system and would soon be free of the penitentiary of my own misdeed! <em>Cool.</em> <br />
<br />"Petition to expunge granted!" the formidable judge pronounced. "State will provide you with the necessary documents after they have been signed!"<br />
<br />"Thank you, your honor."<br />
<br />Woo hoo! And to further enhance my triumphant success as an attorney, I was surprised and flattered when someone elses lawyer approached me to ask if she could review the motion I had filed on my own behalf, saying with a completely unanticpated friendliness that caught me off gaurd that my efforts had been "very <em>good</em>. Very <em>very </em>impressive!"<br />
<br />Oh, you know it, counselor.<br />
<br />Approximately one hour later, I finally left with signed documents in hand, which were now clean and free of ink, both literally and figuratively. It was a pleasant respite from all that had gone before, and a welcome contrast to the folly that I had brought upon my own criminal head as a result of indulging a sweet tooth with poor judgment all those years ago.<br />
<br />Although, if it came down to it, even now, I <em>would</em> kill for a Hershey bar.</div>
