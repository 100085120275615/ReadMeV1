<div><p>See Granholm's latest press release - after the jump.</p>

<p>She's so transparent and political...always jumping around for a premise to base an argument upon...very much like a cat on a hot tin roof.</p>

<p>She blasts these trade policies...but they're the trade policies of Clinton, Gore and Kerry.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span><span>Granholm Fighting for Manufacturing Workers</span></span></strong><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><p><span><span>LANSING</span></span></p><span><span> â In her weekly radio address, Governor Jennifer M. Granholm today sent a message that in <p>Michigan</p>, manufacturing matters.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>âPeople work hard to give their children good homes and good lives,â Granholm said.&nbsp; âMy administration has taken action to help our manufacturers, on behalf of those thousands of people and thousands of families, to keep the jobs that we have at a time when <p>Michigan</p> is ground zero for the global shift in manufacturing jobs.â</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>In December, Granholm signed legislation giving manufacturers a $600 million tax cut.&nbsp; The tax cut included incentives to create and consolidate jobs in <p>Michigan</p> instead of outsourcing them to other countries.&nbsp; </span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Granholm has also been working closely with <p>U.S.</p> Senators Carl Levin and Debbie Stabenow, as well as <p>Michigan</p>âs bipartisan delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives, to press the Bush administration to take action against unfair trade and help our manufacturers succeed in the global marketplace.&nbsp; The <p>U.S.</p> manufacturing industry has lost more than 2.8 million jobs since 2001, including nearly 200,000 here in <p>Michigan</p>.&nbsp; During that time, the Bush administration has failed to change its trade policies.&nbsp; </span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>Granholm has called on the administration to enforce trade laws already on the books, pressure countries like <p>China</p> to end currency manipulation, and protect American products from counterfeiting by other countries.</span></span><span><span> </span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>âAs governor, I see every day what current trade policies are doing to our workers and our employers,â Granholm said.&nbsp; âThatâs why every day I am standing up for our manufacturers, because manufacturing and manufacturing workers matter to <p>Michigan</p>, and they matter to me.â</span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span></span><p></p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>The Governorâs weekly radio address is released each Friday at 10:00 a.m. and may be heard on broadcast stations across the state through an affiliation with the Michigan Association of Broadcasters.&nbsp; The address will also be available on the Governorâs website on Mondays as a podcast for general distribution to personal MP3 players and home computers.</span></span><p></p></p>
