<div>That's the title of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtJEywrgNKQ">clip on YouTube</a> I saw today. This small clip of Hillary Clinton reading a prepared statement and Rumsfeld's attempted response is what inspired me to start blogging.<br />
<br />Actually, that's a lie. It wasn't the video that drove me to blogging. It was the comments posted on the video. Follow that link and scroll down - you can't miss them. Notice anything? Any particular pattern? Well I did. Almost every single comment on that video is either useless and emotional whining about how stupid the administration is, or it's a post suggesting that we should just abandon the entire country and let them figure it out.<br />
<br />I love how people can be so passionate about something they don't know anything about. You don't know the mistakes that were made or the information that was available at the time. You can't! You haven't seen <strong>all</strong> the documents from 9/11, have you? Have you heard the tapes from all the meetings in the Oval Office? I doubt it. So basically nobody outside of a small few actually know everything about what happened.<br />
<br />More importantly than that, bitching about how stupid people are and coming up with your own malicious conspiracy theories does not help anything. We need solutions, people. Not crazy conspiracy theories or JibJab cartoons about the president.<br />
<br />And to those that just want to leave and let the Iraqi police figure everything out. That is the worst idea I have ever heard. I think I've heard my Chia Pet speak more intelligently than that. Regardless of whether you agree with our decision to invade Iraq or not, we're there now. We're there and we've completely disrupted any organized form of government that might have existed at one time in one of the most volatile parts of the world. We are morally obligated to clean up our mess. We can't throw an entire country into disarray and then vanish, leaving a few civilians and bunch of psychopathic killers to pick up the pieces.<br />
<br />We are standing at the edge of disaster here. Let's act like it and start trying to be productive.</div>
