<div class="comment-text"><p>What conservative distortions?</p>
<p>How about the item JABBS had last week about Rush Limbaugh talking about Bushâs second-term poll numbers and saying theyâre comparable to other second-term presidents?</p>
<p>a) His math was wrong.<br />
b) He cited Jimmy Carter, who didnât serve a second term.<br />

<p>&#8220;Tracking back up &#8212; imagine if you went back and looked at several other second-term presidents at this time in their terms, you&#8217;d find almost parallel poll results. We know that Bill Clinton was down in the 20s at one point. Jimmy Carter was way down. Reagan was down. This is really &#8212; really not unique.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s Poll Position Is Worst on Record<br />

<p><strong>This is a terrible misstatement and it really sounded like Rush was really trying to pull a fast one on his listeners.<br />
But Rob ask yourself why were Bushâs poll numbers down WAY DOWN, because conservatives like myself and Limbaugh himself were criticizing the Administration on a number of items:</strong></p>

<p>WASHINGTON May 5, 2006 (AP)â Angry conservatives are driving the approval ratings of President Bush and the GOP-led Congress to dismal new lows, according to an AP-Ipsos poll that underscores why Republicans fear an Election Day massacre.<br />

<p>If you ask me today am I happy with the Job Bush is doing THE ANSWER IS NO! In particular his stance on immigration.<br />
So, you liberals got an orgasm about his poll numbers but you donât even bother to consider that ITâS US CONSERVATIVES who are the driving force behind that.</p>
<p>How about the item JABBS had last week about Bush saying that boutique fuels caused higher gas prices, a point that his own EPA disagrees with â and has the facts to back up?<br />

<p>I DONâT AGREE WITH WHAT HE SAID EITHER, It was a dumb statement!<br />
But please explain to me how that translate into the Democrats alternative energy plan?</p>
<p>REMEMBER THIS:<br />
Last year, Clinton voted against ethanol interests when she opposed a plan that would require nationwide use of ethanol in gasoline. She and other Northeast lawmakers argued that the legislation would increase gasoline prices in regions outside the Farm Belt.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that Clinton now conveniently supports what she adamantly opposed is indicative of priorities long on politics and short on principle,&#8221; said Tracey Schmitt, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee.</p>
<p>Clinton&#8217;s spokesman Philippe Reines said the senator &#8220;strongly believes that rapidly increasing the development of alternative fuels such as ethanol is critical.&#8221;<br />

<p>How about the item JABBS had a couple of weeks ago about Cheney, in which he redefined the term âlast throesâ from when he first used the phrase a year ago?<br />
Iraq insurgency in &#8216;last throes,&#8217; Cheney says<br />

<p>Yes he used the term last year, but Iâll ask you directly what specific plan of action would you have for Iraq? Do you agree with Murthaâs opinion that we should pull out immediately? In your opinion are we losing the war?</p>
<p>How about the time JABBS had a couple of weeks about John Boehnerâs memo, in which he suggests that Democrats hope that terrorism will âfade awayâ on its own â an opinion that no mainstream Democrat has offered.</p>
<p>MURTHA SAID WE SHOULD WITHDRAWL IMMEDIATELY, Dean said last year that WE CANâT WIN IN IRAQ! So what is your stance?</p>
<p>I listen to a speech give by a former Iraq commander and he talked about all of the things the troops are doing and all of the successes in Iraq, NO LIBERAL BLOG OR MEDIA SOURCE HAS EVER HIGHLIGHTED THOSE SUCCESSES.<br />
Iâll put the link to the video back up in case you missed it.<br />
We should be in Iraq, we needed to be in Iraq, we are not in Iraq, to âspread democracyâ that is just a political term. We MUST have a military foundation in Iraq and the Middle East to protect out interest YES OIL!<br />
Liberal who talk that bullshit about no blood for oil bullshit are a bunch of fucken hypocrites.<br />
Democrats have not forwarded a SOUND AND REASONABLE PLAN for Iraq other than Murthaâs idiot suggestion to move the troops to Okinawa. Oh, Iâm sorry did he misspeak, kinda like Limbaughâs Carterâs second term numbers I guess.</p>

<p>How about the time JABBS had today about Bush talking about Democrats wanting to wave âthe white flag of surrenderâ â a distortion of the Democratsâ view, and silly given that Gen. Casey offered a redeployment plan similar to the one offered by Sens. Levin and Reed.<br />

<p>Dean says Democrats have united plan</p>
<p>Party chairman and Kerry offer specific Iraq withdrawal proposals<br />
Friday, December 9, 2005; Posted: 4:00 p.m. EST (21:00 GMT)<br />
WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8212; Leading Democrats sought Thursday to promote a specific plan for what party chairman Howard Dean called a &#8220;strategic redeployment&#8221; of U.S. troops from Iraq.</p>
<p>Dean said on CNN&#8217;s &#8220;American Morning&#8221; that Democrats have a plan for Iraq &#8220;that we can coalesce around&#8221; and that the differences between Democrats are being overemphasized by the media.<br />
&#8220;I think that&#8217;s mostly press gobbledygook,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The press wants to focus on the differences. The differences are pretty small, perhaps Senator Lieberman excepted.&#8221;<br />
On Wednesday, Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut reproached fellow Democrats for criticizing President Bush during a time of war.<br />
&#8220;It&#8217;s time for Democrats who distrust President Bush to acknowledge that he will be the commander in chief for three more critical years and that in matters of war we undermine presidential credibility at our nation&#8217;s peril,&#8221; Lieberman said.<br />
Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, a leading Democratic congressman on military issues, voiced his disagreement with Lieberman&#8217;s statement and reiterated his call for a U.S. withdrawal from Iraq &#8220;at the earliest practicable date.&#8221;<br />
Dean said he is &#8220;with Jack Murtha&#8221; about withdrawing troops from Iraq.<br />
&#8220;We need a strategic redeployment of our troops. We need to bring the 50,000 [National] Guard troops home in the next six months. They don&#8217;t belong there in the first place,&#8221; Dean said.<br />
&#8220;We need a special task force of anti-terrorist troops stationed in the Middle East, because we&#8217;re going to have to deal with [terrorist leader Abu Musab al-] Zarqawi for a long time.<br />
&#8220;We need 20,000 additional troops in Afghanistan, not in Iraq. We need to redeploy our troops &#8230; and stop making our troops the target over there,&#8221; he said.<br />
Some of Dean&#8217;s comments contrasted with those he made in a radio interview Monday that the United States appears to be repeating the mistakes of Vietnam in Iraq &#8212; and that the idea that the war in Iraq can be won is &#8220;just plain wrong.&#8221;<br />
&#8220;We can only win the war, which we have to win, if we change our strategy dramatically. The Democrats are coalescing around a very different strategy. We hope the president will join us,&#8221; Dean said on CNN.<br />
Dean was assailed by some Republicans for his comments Monday, and Bush countered by saying the war can and will be won.<br />
&#8220;I know we&#8217;re going to win,&#8221; Bush told reporters Tuesday at the White House. &#8220;Our troops need to hear not only are they supported but that we have got a strategy that will win.<br />
Dean said his comments from the radio interview in San Antonio, Texas, were taken &#8220;out of context. They kind of cherry-picked that one the same way the president cherry-picked the intelligence going into Iraq.&#8221;<br />
Kerry gets specific<br />
Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts offered more specifics for withdrawal following a speech Thursday to the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.<br />
Kerry said he thought at least 100,000 troops could be withdrawn by this time next year. &#8220;[You could] bring it down somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000 to 40,000. And then see where you are,&#8221; he said.<br />
But, Kerry said, he &#8220;would not do it on a fixed, automatic timetable. It has to be results coordinated.&#8221;<br />
He said the withdrawal should take place in stages according to &#8220;a series of benchmarks of accomplishment&#8221; by the Iraqis.<br />
One benchmark Kerry cited was the December 15 parliamentary elections. If those go well, he said, the United States might withdraw 20,000 troops.<br />
The proposals by Dean and Kerry appeared to be similar in part to what Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld said Thursday night was the Pentagon&#8217;s plan to bring home nearly 20,000 troops following the elections.<br />
Rumsfeld said military officials will consider reducing troop strength further if the &#8220;conditions permit.&#8221;<br />
American troop levels, once as high as 160,000, now stand at 155,000, Rumsfeld said on PBS&#8217;s &#8220;NewsHour with Jim Lehrer.&#8221; Troop levels were increased by about 20,000 in anticipation of election violence by insurgents.<br />
&#8220;We&#8217;re going to go back down to our baseline of 137-138,000 after the elections. I&#8217;m sure of that,&#8221; Rumsfeld said. &#8220;Then, after that, we&#8217;ll look at the conditions, the circumstances.&#8221;<br />
A Pentagon source said Thursday one option under consideration calls for sending a brigade of the 1st Armored Division in Germany to Kuwait as a rapid reaction force, instead of directly to Iraq.<br />
A brigade of the 1st Infantry Division scheduled to deploy from Fort Riley, Kansas, might stay home and only small groups sent to serve as additional trainers for Iraqi security forces, officials said.<br />
Those two moves would mean a further reduction of roughly 10,000 troops &#8212; to around 127,000 &#8212; as other units end their missions and aren&#8217;t replaced.<br />
Lieberman had breakfast Thursday with Rumsfeld and Gen. Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. A Pentagon official said the invitation was extended a few days ago, following Lieberman&#8217;s statements of support for Bush on the war.<br />
Rumsfeld regularly sets aside time to meet with members of Congress on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but the official acknowledged this invitation was unusual. The secretary also met a few months ago with Murtha.<br />
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have given speeches rejecting calls for the immediate withdrawal of U.S. troops but conceding the course of the war is changing.<br />
Both have praised Lieberman for his comments. &#8220;Senator Lieberman is right,&#8221; Bush said.</p>

<p>Pelosi Hails Democrats&#8217; Diverse War Stances</p>
<p>By Dan Balz<br />
Washington Post Staff Writer<br />
Friday, December 16, 2005; Page A23</p>
<p>House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said yesterday that Democrats should not seek a unified position on an exit strategy in Iraq, calling the war a matter of individual conscience and saying differing positions within the caucus are a source of strength for the party.</p>
<p>Pelosi said Democrats will produce an issue agenda for the 2006 elections but it will not include a position on Iraq. There is consensus within the party that President Bush has mismanaged the war and that a new course is needed, but House Democrats should be free to take individual positions, she sad.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no one Democratic voice . . . and there is no one Democratic position,&#8221; Pelosi said in an interview with Washington Post reporters and editors.</p>
<p>Pelosi recently endorsed the proposal by Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) for a swift redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq over a period of six months, but no other party leader followed, and House Minority Whip Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) publicly opposed her.</p>
<p>She said her support for Murtha was not intended to forge a Democratic position on the war, adding that she blocked an effort by some of her colleagues to put the Democrats on record backing Murtha.</p>
<p>Her comments ruling out a caucus position appeared to put Pelosi at odds with some other party officials. Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean recently said Democrats were beginning to coalesce around a strategy that would pull out all troops over the next two years. Rep. Rahm Emanuel (Ill.), chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said on the day Murtha offered his plan, &#8220;As for Iraq policy, at the right time, we&#8217;ll have a position.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pelosi, one of the most liberal Democrats in the House, opposed the war and, as the senior Democrat on the intelligence committee before the invasion, argued that Saddam Hussein posed no imminent threat to the United States. She served as Democratic whip when Congress authorized Bush to go to war, and she rallied 126 Democratic votes against the measure when then-Rep. Richard A. Gephardt (Mo.), the Democratic leader, supported the White House.</p>
<p>Pelosi said she had not consulted with Dean or Senate Minority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) before taking her position. Her action angered some Democrats, who believed it left the party vulnerable to criticism from the Republicans, but cheered the party&#8217;s antiwar activists who want party leaders to challenge Bush more vigorously on the war.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, House Republicans are planning to seek a vote as early as today on a resolution saying that an &#8220;artificial timetable&#8221; for the withdrawal of troops is &#8220;fundamentally inconsistent with achieving victory in Iraq.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview, Pelosi labeled the Republican-controlled Congress &#8220;the most corrupt in history&#8221; and repeated her assertion that Democrats will make ethics a central issue next year. She said that the issue and ethical climate in the country point to Democratic gains next year, and noted that if the elections were held today, Democrats would take control of the House.</p>
<p>If Democrats are able to win the majority next year, Pelosi pledged aggressive oversight of the administration on issues including the war, intelligence and how the government responded to Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Pelosi said Democrats scored significant victories recently, the biggest coming on Social Security, on which she said Democratic opposition to Bush&#8217;s proposed private or personal accounts blocked any hopes the White House had for changing the government retirement insurance program this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only did we take him down on that, but we took down a lot of his credibility as being somebody who cared about &#8216;people like me,&#8217; &#8221; she said.
