<p>I like Joe Lieberman.  He is a thoughtful and decent man with a great sense of civic responsibility.  Any list of legislators who were distinguished by their willingness to put nation over self-interest (a document certain to be shorter than an anorexic&#8217;s grocery order) would include Joe Lieberman.  I believe that the Senate will be much the poorer for his absence.</p>
	<p>Still, I think his decision to run as an independent is a bad one.  It is undoubted that the presence of his Democratic opponent in the Senate will only worsen the partisan divide.  Anyone so popular with dailykos and the moveon.org crowd is sure to be another Mary Poppins of the nanny state.  And, while I like to believe that the Republican will win a three-way race, that seems as doubtful as a Bill Clinton explanation of lipstick on his collar (Honest Hillary, she tripped, I caught her and her lips landed on my neck.  Trust me.&#8221;).  </p>
	<p>If Lieberman runs as an independent, and especially if he wins, it will be a major defeat for the two party system at a time when both parties have been weakened to dangerous levels by the power of incumbents, the growth of single issue groups and a range of other major problems.  As much as I would prefer Lieberman to Lamont, Lieberman used the Democrat party to achieve his position.  He benefitted from Democrat organizations and Democrat money and from the hard work of many decent and hard-working individuals who genuinely believed that he stood for the party.  </p>
	<p>Sad to say, in this lack of loyalty to his party, Lieberman seems to be more like the majority of his fellow legislators.  His decision to campaign on, however satisfying it might be to his supporters or to Republicans, will hurt the party that made him and weaken the two party system that has so well-served America.</p>
	<p>When legislators place their own good above the good of their party, it becomes more likely that they will put their interests above those of the people.  I hoped that Joe Lieberman was better than that.  He risked his office to support a President not of his party against his party.  He paid a price for his principles and he deserved better of his party.  To now run as an independent diminishes his stand.  nd it leaves our political system even weaker.</p>
