<div>The Progressive Blog is proud to announce its endorsement of Deval Patrick, Democrat for Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.<br />
<br />The Progressive Blog has endorsed only one candidate previously (<a href="http://theprogressiveblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/john-bonifaz-for-secretary-of.html">http://theprogressiveblog.blogspot.com/2005/12/john-bonifaz-for-secretary-of.html</a>), and aims not to endorse candidates in every race, but to endorse only deserving candidates. One such candidate is Deval Patrick.<br />
<br />Deval Patrick brings to the table an amazing life story â one that embodies what might be described as the âAmerican Dream.â I watched him speak at the Democratic Convention about living in an apartment on the South Side of Chicago where he shared bunk beds with mother and sister so that every third night one of the three slept on the floor, and where his uncle sometimes shot heroin in the living room. I encourage you to go to <a href="http://blog.devalpatrick.com/videos/">http://blog.devalpatrick.com/videos/</a> to watch that speech. Of course, Deval went on to study at Harvard, practice law with the NAACP, serve in the Clinton Justice Department, and then, interestingly enough, a work as a corporate executive.<br />
<br />Deval Patrick, more importantly, positions himself most progressively on the issues that matter. He is pro-choice, pro-wind farm, pro-gay marriage, and anti-death penalty. Patrick is not afraid to reject a cut in the income tax at this time, though to do so might be a smart political pander (albeit neither realistic nor responsible, given the need in public programs and the understaffing at state agencies created by years of Republican rule). Patrick understands firsthand the importance of education and health care, and his positions on each are well thought and sensible. In addition, he has a great understanding of business, which is certainly not a commonality for Progressives. Most of these positions are not sound-bite-able though, so I encourage you to check out <a href="http://www.devalpatrick.com/mmf_overview.cfm">www.DevalPatrick.com/mmf_overview.cfm</a> .<br />
<br />The Patrick campaign has inspired the grassroots in Massachusetts. I have seen him speak to thousands, and to groups of fewer than ten people. He appreciates his citizen supporters, using slogans like âtogether we canâ and denouncing âpolitics as usual.â He has also been active in the blogosphere, evening granting an interview to yours truly. Patrick is also eager to debate his political opponents, and not afraid to utilize public financing for his campaign.<br />
<br />Patrick has garnered the endorsements of Robert Reich, Senator Barack Obama, and Congressmen Capuano, Frank, McGovern, Olver and Tierney. Patrick also won, resoundingly, the nomination of the 2006 Massachusetts Democratic Party Convention, earning nearly sixty-percent of the delegate vote in a three-man race.<br />
<br />The Progressive Blog is proud to endorse Deval Patrick, and I personally look forward to his stop in my own City of Lynn just a few days from now.<br />
