<p class="MsoNormal">My parents hate Hillary Clinton. Theyâre major liberals so Iâm not sure why exactly. In fact, most liberals I know are pretty disappointed in the woman. And yet, I canât figure out <i>why.</i>
</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Iâll concede that sheâs a disappointing pick for the first female president. She doesnât seem incredible and brilliant enough to me; I would want the First Female Prez to be totally awesome. I would also want the her to be better backed by popular support, in general.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Hillaryâs lack of support from the Left mystifies me. I tried to separate myself from my own politics for a moment and took a neutral stance while perusing her site today.</p>  <p class="MsoNormal">I admit that thereâs veracity to the cliche of her harping âThink of the children.â A few moments into her site is all it takes to notice the corny repetition. Itâs also a phrase that you donât often hear from male candidates (if EVER). Thus, Hillary appears to have an intrinsically feminine, almost <i>motherly</i> approach to politics - which is a turn-off, since I think of American policy as intrinsically masculine. Instead of fighting for America and asserting its power or independence, she seems to want to baby the country, to take care of it like a sick child.<br />
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It seems sad that irritating rhetoric could affect so much, especially since it appears that her actions as Senator have benefited 
New York
. Yet, Rhetoric was key in Bush v. Kerry. In general, rhetorical devices are key. The Repubs are the masters, at least for now, and I haven't yet found a Dem to measure up to the Repubs rhetorically. I'm not saying that's what makes or breaks the position for me personally - but it does make or break the position on the national level. If you want to win the hearts of the Moderate Middle, you're going to need catchphrases that stick and crystal-clear stated policies.<br />
</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">In terms of Iraq, Hillary has taken the path away from many Democrats and has pledged to âfinish the job." Her site even has some lip service promoting the spread-of-Democracy, which is interesting because it probably isnât doing her poll numbers any favors. In general, she wants to promote human rights and democracy and toleration â and who could argue with those policies? The Left, apparently.<br />
</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">The main problem for <i>me</i> with Hillary is that sheâs a woman. I think that there are many women who would be excellent leaders â¦ but right now, while we deal with the Middle East, Iâm not sure a woman is a great idea. They donât even respect women over there. They may not respect Bush, but would they respect Hillary more? I do think we need a peacekeeper and <a href="http://logicmovement.blogspot.com/2006/06/independence-vs-cooperation-sexism.html">I have said that</a> I think women are better at establishing common ground. So, in that light, maybe a woman would be helpful - I'm just worried diplomats wouldn't take her seriously.<br />
</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">For many, this is going to come down to man v. woman. I donât know if a woman can lead the country right now or not, but I can definitely be convinced (and so should you all!). Iâll have to wait and see how the election debates and other activities go on the path to 2008, but Iâm not holding my breath on Hillary.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">She doesnât seem to have a plan for 
Iraq
, either, and thatâs also a problem. But who <i>does</i> have a plan?</p>    <p class="MsoNormal">Hereâs hoping Obama firms up some of his policies. Heâs said some things I agree with.</p>
