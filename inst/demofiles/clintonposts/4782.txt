<p>The New York Times has decided to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/23/nyregion/23clintons.html">peer into the Clinton bedroom window once again</a>.  It&#8217;s 1998, all over again. You remember, that nostalgic era when a president could be impeached&#8212; not for manufacturing a false rationale for taking the country to war&#8212; but for oral sex.</p>

<p>This kind of thing belongs in People magazine, not on page one of the New York Times.  Can we also expect to see this level of dogged rummaging through the private lives of  truly slimy Republican candidates, like&#8212; oh, just to name one at random&#8212; Giuliani?  If the intimate lives of Democrats are relevant in an election cycle, why not all candidates for higher office, including Republicans?</p>

<p>And, isn&#8217;t the White House itself fair game, what with its insistence on an abstinence-only sex education policy? How about a detailed  examination of the sex lives of all non-married members of the Bush administration? Are they &#8220;saving it&#8221;? Or just having trouble finding interest?</p>

<p><a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_digbysblog_archive.html#114836371817918495">Digby</a> has it about right:</p>

<blockquote><p>No folks, that excerpt isn&#8217;t from Hello magazine or even Vanity Fair. That&#8217;s the New York fucking Times and it&#8217;s on page one. If people aren&#8217;t thinking about the Clintons in terms of infidelity and betrayal now, New York&#8217;s newest tabloid rag is going to make damned sure they are reminded of it.</p>

<p>    I do not know if Hillary is running for president and I&#8217;m not making a case for her candidacy. I do, however, think she has the right to try to earn the nomination without this gossip-at-the-hair salon coverage by the NY Times. And believe me, it won&#8217;t just be her. Look at the spooky picture of Mark Warner on the cover of New York Times Magazine. He looked like something out of a David Lynch movie. I have no doubt that we are going to be reading many derisive accounts of Al Gore the bearded, earth toned circus freak. It&#8217;s quite clear that if the Democrats are are coming into power, the Times is going to pick up right where it left off when it was last obsessed with Clinton&#8217;s crotch and Hillary&#8217;s cold, cold heart. Or perhaps, more to the point, this piece is just a first notice that they plan to.</p>

<p>    Democrats be advised: the press is a bunch of braindead robots who are uninterested in changing their puerile Democratic storyline even in the face of the most disasterous administration in American history.It&#8217;s shocking. You can love Hillary or hate her, I don&#8217;t care. But goddamit the intimate state of her marriage to Bill Clinton is nobody&#8217;s business and it <span class="caps">NEVER HAS BEEN.</span> If the gossip rags want to play this game, there&#8217;s nothing anyone can do. But it is just shameful that the New York Times would go back to their cheap, tabloid coverage of politics when the world is on fire. I&#8217;m honestly stunned that this is happening again.</p></blockquote>
