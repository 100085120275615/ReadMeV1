<div>That's the title of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1595230092/sr=1-1/qid=1139192440/ref=pd_bbs_1/102-0118422-6399318?%5Fencoding=UTF8">an actual book</a> I spotted in the USC bookstore -- <em>Women Who Make the World Worse: and How Their Radical Feminist Assault Is Ruining Our Schools, Families, Military, and Sports</em>.  (I like how "Sports" is last, as though its ruin is the most grievous assault of all.)  On the cover is a blurb by Rush Limbaugh ("Know your enemy.  Buy this gutsy book!") above ugly caricatures of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Hillary Clinton, Jane Fonda, and Sarah Jessica Parker.  I thought it was a joke when I saw it, but I picked it up and it is deadly serious.  I kind of really want to buy it now, but I don't want it in my house and none of my friends will accept it as a gift.  Believe me, I've asked around.<br />
<br />"I hate women," Sherman kept remarking yesterday, occasionally adding, "but I'm not a misogynist.  I just hate women."  We were watching <em>The Kids in the Hall</em> and this strange young woman had been repeatedly calling Sherman on his cell phone all day, from several different phone numbers.<br />
<br />"Who is she?" I asked.<br />
<br />"I have no idea!" he said.  "All I know is, she keeps calling me, and...<em>rapping</em>."<br />
<br />At this moment, his phone rang.  He snatched it up and answered it: "Okay, rap at me."  He listened.  "Well, go on now.  If you're going to rap, then rap...Fine, want me to rap at YOU?  Fine, I will...<em>Once upon a time, not long ago / When people wore pajamas and talked real slow</em> -- wait, that's not it -- oh, shit, I messed up...Hello?"  He hung up.  "She's gone."<br />
<br />"You have no idea how she got your number?" I asked.<br />
<br />"None at all," he said.  "For all I know she's just some crackhead dialing the same random numbers over and over again from different pay phones.  And, I mean, I'm sorry for her and all that, but I wish she'd stop calling me!"<br />
<br />His phone rang again.  He groaned.<br />
<br />"I'll answer it," I offered.<br />
<br />He tossed me the phone and I opened it up: "Hello?"<br />
<br />There was a mumbled string of unintelligible words from a rough voice that sounded young, female, and black.<br />
<br />"Sorry, what?" I said.<br />
<br />"Who is this?" she demanded.  Definitely black.<br />
<br />"Who is <em>this</em>?" I countered.<br />
<br />"You're not who I was talking to before...how old are you?"<br />
<br />"Eighteen," I said.  "How old are you?"<br />
<br />"Nineteen," she said.<br />
<br />"So we're almost the same age," I said.  "That's nice!"<br />
<br />"You got a boyfriend?" she asked.<br />
<br />"No," I said, "I'm single."<br />
<br />"You wish you had a boyfriend?"<br />
<br />"Can't say that I do," I said.  "I'm really quite happy being single.  What about you?  Do you have a boyfriend?"<br />
<br />"No," she said.  "You like to [<em>static</em>]..."<br />
<br />"What?"<br />
<br />"You like to get freaky with other girls?" she asked.  "You wanna get freaky together?"<br />
<br />"Oh!  Well, that's very kind of you to ask," I said (wondering, <em>What the fuck IS it about me?</em>), "and I'm flattered, really, but...we hardly know each other.  And you're not here."<br />
<br />"It don't matter," she said.  "We can get freaky over the phone."<br />
<br />"What are you wearing?" I asked, and I saw the guys in the room perk up.<br />
<br />"My underwear," she said.  "What are you wearing?"<br />
<br />"Um..."  I checked.  "Pants," I said truthfully.<br />
<br />"That's all?  What are you wearing over your stomach?"<br />
<br />"A shirt," I said -- and then, worrying that I was coming off a tad Victorian, I added: "But <em>nothing</em> under the shirt.  Nothing at all.  Except my bra."<br />
<br />"Can you take off your shirt?" she asked.<br />
<br />I considered it, but I couldn't see the benefits outweighing the risk.  "I could," I said, trying to reason with her, "but is that really what you want?  If I took off my shirt, would you be any less lonely?  I think it's really love that you're looking for, and I can't give that to you over the phone."<br />
<br />"I don't know what you're talkin' about," she said.  "I just want you to take off your shirt."<br />
<br />I admired her assertiveness.  Before I could tell her so, though, Sherman held up a scrap of paper in front of my face and said, "Make her call my roommate instead!"<br />
<br />"Listen," I said into the phone, "I've got another phone number for you, okay?  Have you got a pen?"  I recited it for her.  "Now you go and call that number, okay?"<br />
<br />The girl sounded skeptical.  "That's the number of the police station," she guessed.  "You gonna make me call the police station, ain't you?"<br />
<br />"No!" I cried.  "I would never do that!  But listen, if you're in trouble, you should get some help, okay?  Will you do that for me?  Will you get help?...Hello?"<br />
<br />She was gone, and she never called back.  Nobody said so, but I think we all kind of missed her.<br />
<br />***<br />
<br />Believe it or not, that was not my strangest female encounter of the weekend.  Or even my only experience with simulated interracial phone sex.<br />
<br />The night before, Friday night, had been my third Big Game Hunters show.  The show itself had been a hit; I was especially pleased with the audience response to the sketch I'd written about a tech-support phone call that evolves surreally into onstage sex.  Whispers were going around backstage that this was our best show yet.<br />
<br />"You gonna be awkward at the after-party tonight?" Mike asked me backstage.<br />
<br />"I guess so," I said.  Awkwardly.<br />
<br />And sure enough, Carrie and LK and I wound up standing in a tight little circle of awkwardness at the crowded outdoor party, shouting to hear each other over the loud band that was playing.<br />
<br />"DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?"<br />
<br />"WHAT?"<br />
<br />"WHAT?"<br />
<br />"WHAT?"<br />
<br />"What?" asked this cute, dazed-looking blonde girl who had suddenly appeared out of nowhere.<br />
<br />"Not you," I informed her, turning away.<br />
<br />"What's your name?" LK asked her, remembering to be polite.<br />
<br />"I'm Rita," she said.  (Her name has been changed to an <em>Arrested Development</em> reference to protect the innocent.)<br />
<br />"I'm Frankie," I said, "this is LK, and this is--"  I looked around.  Carrie was a few feet away, talking about TV with a fellow screenwriting major, a smart and sharp-witted young woman who assigns everyone the name of a TV character.  In return, I'll call her Daria.<br />
<br />"I HATE <em>Sex and the City</em>," Daria was saying, "and I hate people who say it's a feminist show.  I'm sorry, but I don't think it's a feminist statement to act like a slut!  I mean, hell, it's basically a show about gay men -- there were barely even any women on the writing staff of <em>Sex and the City</em>."<br />
<br />"I love <em>Sex and the City</em>," announced Rita, who had clearly wandered over just in time to hear the end of that sentence.  "Do you like <em>Gilmore Girls</em>?"<br />
<br />"Oh, yes," said Daria, "I hate Rory but I love the show."<br />
<br />"It's my favorite show," said Rita.  She had a weird way of talking -- very breathy and slow.<br />
<br />"Listen," said Daria, "this party kind of blows and I'm starving.  What do you say we ditch it and go get some dinner?"  She looked around at me, Carrie, and LK.  "You're all welcome to come."<br />
<br />"Sure!" we said -- along with Rita.<br />
<br />The next thing we knew, Carrie, LK, Rita, and I were riding Daria's car on the freeway.  I was in front, but behind me I could hear Rita babbling away in her soft, slow, breathy voice.<br />
<br />"Love is real," she was saying.  "Love is definitely real.  Like...me and my boyfriend?...that is love.  Like...one time...I got drunk and puked on my boyfriend's floor?  And he was totally okay about it?  And he was like, 'Why didn't you use the toilet?'  And I was like, 'I'm sorry...I thought you'd be mad at me if I puked?...so I lay down on the floor and tried not to puke?...and then?...I did.'  And he was like, 'Do you want me to hold your hair?'  And I think...if a guy holds your hair?...that is love."<br />
<br />"Are you drunk now?" asked Daria, delicately.<br />
<br />"No," said Rita simply.  There was an awkward silence in the car and she added: "Well...maybe a little?  But...I'm like this always."<br />
<br />"Thanks for driving us, Daria," I said to change the subject.  "It's really cool of you to do this."<br />
<br />"No problem," she said.  "I know you don't have a driver's license, so it's my pleasure."<br />
<br />"Whoa, whoa, wait," said Rita.  "You <em>don't have a driver's license?</em>"<br />
<br />"I'm from New York City," I parroted.  "We don't drive."<br />
<br />"Oh my <em>god</em>," squealed Rita, "that is <em>so cute!</em>"<br />
<br />"Uh-huh."<br />
<br />"No, <em>seriously</em>!  That is <em>so cute</em>!  I wish I didn't have a driver's license!  Then I wouldn't have to pick people up from the airport!"<br />
<br />"Uh-<em>huh</em>."<br />
<br />Rita was not getting the hint.  "So you really don't know how to drive?  You're like...a little kid!"<br />
<br />"So, Daria," LK cut in abruptly, sensing the warning twitches coming from the front seat, "where are you taking us?"<br />
<br />"Canter's Delicatessen," she said.  "It's open all night."<br />
<br />I gasped.  "<em>The</em> Canter's Delicatessen?"  I couldn't stop myself, I was so excited.  "Oh my god, they go there in <em>Weetzie Bat</em>!  Weetzie and Dirk go there the morning after Weetzie has sex with that sleazy guy in the rock band and Dirk has sex with a stranger he met in a sex shop, and then they have bagels at Canter's!  And it makes Weetzie feel better because she ate Canter's bagels when she was a baby!"<br />
<br />"I remember that," said Carrie.  "And then Weetzie says that they need to find Ducks."<br />
<br />"And then they <em>do</em>!  Dirk meets Duck and Weetzie meets My Secret Agent Lover Man!"<br />
<br />"You are <em>so</em> cute," Daria said to me as we pulled into the parking lot.  "You like Francesca Lia Block too?"<br />
<br />"I will admit," I said, "that her work was...not un-instrumental in my decision to come to L.A."  I sighed.  "It's not really like she describes it in the books."<br />
<br />"No kidding," said Daria.  "I like it anyway, though."<br />
<br />The five of us sat down at a booth and ordered food.  Only in L.A. would a Jewish deli offer "Avocado, Cheddar, Tomato, and Alfalfa on Whole Wheat" on the menu, but as soon as I bit into my pastrami sandwich I knew: "Oh my god," I sighed, "I've come home."<br />
<br />"I have to go to the bathroom," announced Rita.  She wandered off.<br />
<br />"Okay, time out," said Carrie as soon as Rita was out of earshot.  "Who <em>is</em> that girl?"<br />
<br />Daria stared.  "I thought she was <em>your</em> friend!"<br />
<br />"I've never met her," I said.<br />
<br />"Never seen her before in my life," said Carrie.<br />
<br />"I don't even go to USC!" said LK.<br />
<br />We stared at each other in amazement.  "So you're saying," said Daria, "that I just picked up a total stranger and drove her out to West Hollywood?"<br />
<br />"I think what's weirder," said Carrie, "is that <em>she</em> just got into a car with four total strangers."<br />
<br />"She tricked me!" raged Daria.<br />
<br />"I kind of like her," I declared.  "She has a childlike sense of wonder."<br />
<br />"Shh," said LK, "she's coming back."<br />
<br />Rita sat back down and I launched into a story: "Last weekend I was watching <em>Wet Hot American Summer</em> with the guys, and it got to the part where Michael Ian Black hooks up with Bradley Cooper, and I mentioned how that part of the movie -- naked Michael Ian Black and Bradley Cooper making out -- was my screensaver for a year."<br />
<br />"I remember that screensaver," said LK.  "It was hot."<br />
<br />"Well, I told them this, and Mike said, 'Frankie, you need a hobby.'  And Sherman said, 'Haven't you noticed?  Frankie's hobby <em>is</em> gay people.' "<br />
<br />Carrie, LK, and Daria laughed; it was funny because it was true.<br />
<br />"I want a gay best friend," announced Rita.<br />
<br />"You do?" we said uncertainly.<br />
<br />"Yeah," she said.  Slow, breathy, sincere.  "Like, a really, really gay guy who will be my best friend and give me fashion advice and dating advice.  I would go shopping with him, and he would give me makeovers and do my hair for me.  And he'd be really, <em>really</em> gay and funny.  Like Jack on <em>Will and Grace</em>."<br />
<br />"You know what I want?" remarked Carrie in a friendly tone.  "I want a guy I can fold up and carry around in my backpack."<br />
<br />"You do?" said Rita.<br />
<br />"Yeah!" said Carrie.  "He'd be sort of like a fashion accessory.  You know, more of an object than a person.  But whenever I got tired of him, I'd just fold him up and put him away until he was of use to me again."<br />
<br />"Totally!" agreed Rita.<br />
<br />Carrie is <em>brilliant</em>.  Daria and LK and I couldn't even look her in the eye for fear of cracking up, but her sarcasm was so subtle that it flew right over Rita's head.<br />
<br />"I don't want a lesbian friend, though," Rita continued.  "Because...if I were a lesbian...obviously I'd want a pretty girlfriend, right?  But then if I <em>had</em> a girlfriend...I'd always be like, 'Is she prettier than me?'  Like...I'd always be jealous of her...you know?"<br />
<br />"That's so wise," I said.  "In fact, it sounds like the sort of concept I could work into a sketch.  Maybe I should suggest it to the Big Game Hunters."<br />
<br />"Who are the Big Game Hunters?" asked Rita.</div>
