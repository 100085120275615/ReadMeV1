<div>I'm hankering for a candidate for president. After a recent discussion prompted by <a href="http://www.teambio.org/2006/02/you-don%e2%80%99t-need-a-weatherman-to-see-which-way-the-wind-blows/#more-2820">Jet over at Bring It On</a>, I'm feeling pretty starved.  I'm honestly not excited by anyone in the field now -- by in the field I mean recognized by mainstream politicos. <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2006/03/the_friday_line.html#more">Chris Cillizza</a> has a post on the Washington Post blog that gives the rundown of the candidates and declares Clinton and McCain their parties' front runners. Cillizza picks Hillary, Bayh, Edwards, Gore, Kerry, and Warner for his Democratic short list and McCain, Allen, Guiliani, Frist, and Romney as the Republicans. Yawn.

I think Hillary and McCain are probably the two worst candidates in the race. Hillary has become a mealy mouthed moderate whose continued support for the war and lack of leadership in opposition to Bush's agenda is unacceptable. I think she'd be great for our nationalizing health care and restoring some of the environmental standards Bush has destroyed, but I'm not going to support her just for those issues. McCain is a hardcore neocon who has no credibility as a reformer any more. He's been Bush's <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2006/02/27/daily11.html?from_rss=1">obedient puppy</a> since the 2000 primary. If you think we'll get out of Iraq any time this century with McCain as president, you're wrong.  I did like Cillizza's breakdown of Gore:
<blockquote>
<span>Yes, <em>that</em> Al Gore.  <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2006/02/the_case_for_al_gore.html">As I outlined in a recent Fix post</a>, Gore can make a legitimate case for the nomination. He is the only candidate who has shown that he can raise the $50 million (or more) necessary to compete against Clinton for the nomination, and he's the only one who has been unequivocally against the Iraq war from the start. From what we hear, Gore is not interested in participating in the nitty-gritty politics necessary to run and win the 2008 nomination, preferring instead to be drafted -- who wouldn't! Still, until Gore formally says no, he belongs on the Line.</span>
</blockquote>
Frankly I'm more excited by Jet's picks of Feingold and John Conyers. I would also add Brian Schweitzer to my short list. I want to see a progressive candidate who can bring a campaign back to the grassroots and netroots of America's liberals. I want to see someone who it's beholden to party interests and interest groups. I want someone who isn't scared of Republicans. I <a href="http://www.teambio.org/2006/02/you-don%e2%80%99t-need-a-weatherman-to-see-which-way-the-wind-blows/#comment-16564">commented</a> to Jet:
<blockquote>
<span>I donÃÂt know that any of the commonly talked about candidates are that impressive, particularly to the whole nation (especially considering they may be running against the likes of Condi Rice, Jeb Bush, and Sam Brownback). ItÃÂs a mistake for us to be sitting and waiting for the ideal personality to come out and bring us back the White House. We need a national agenda that brings progressive values back to the WH and shows the American people how government can best be used to improve their lives and fatten their wallets. This has to start in 2006 and develop into a springboard for whoever the eventual nominee is.</span>

I'm not terribly excited by anyone I've mentioned in this post. Yes, I could definitely get behind Feingold, Gore, Schweitzer, or even Clark or Edwards if that's the direction we were going in. But I don't see a perfect candidate out there and the candidates I like aren't stepping forward while the punditry is coronating limp noodles like Hillary, Bayh, and Kerry as the front runners for our nomination. The netroots need to start pushing someone, begging someone to step forward. Feingold, Gore, and Schweitzer are the three I think most worthy of a push, but can we draw them into debate online? What do they have to say about the current state of the Democratic Party and its role contra Bush? Leadership on the issues has to include leadership of the party and since we're not about to crown a netroots candidate two years out, let's demand input from our hopefuls.</div>
