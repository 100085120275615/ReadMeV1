<div>Chris started a <a href="http://outsidereport.blogspot.com/2006/02/day-mccain-became-beatable.html">good discussion about McCain</a>, invincibility of.  It is worth adding one more point: I would think that there are inherent risks to being a media darling for such a prolonged period before an election cycle ever begins (2008 would mark the 8th...<em>8th</em>...year of McCain's media darling status).  Reporters just love to "challenge" conventional wisdom--even though they usually end up failing miserably.  They will come up with stupid, silly petty issues and over-correct for the circle jerk that has been that last eight years by nit-picking at McCain in order to prove that they are "balanced" and "objective."  See Gore, exaggerations of.<br />
<br />So here is where I am on 2008 from what I know (or assume):<br />
<br />Hillary might well win the nomination but can't win the presidency.  They will call her a feminazi and somehow, this will catch her completely by surprise and she will be unable to respond.  Seriously.<br />
<br />Kerry cannot get the nomination again.  Over the last year, he seems to have been operating under the assumption that he would have to cozy up to liberals in order to win the nomination.  He couldn't be more wrong.  What he really needed to do was use his position as the only candidate for president to return to the Senate in close to a century (Goldwater returned two years after he lost)--and display some true national-dialogue-nurturing leadership.  Instead we have a guy who horded campaign cash and faked a filibuster on Alito from Switzerland.  And, I don't know about you, but he's been spamming my email box all year...  It's not that he is boring this time around; it is that he is annoying and irritating.<br />
<br />Edwards, Feingold, Gore and Clark all have a resonable shot at launching a Dean-esque campaign with a lot of passionate support on the part of grassroots activists.  The question for this group is will they all be dipping into the same pot?<br />
<br />Biden is dead in the water.  Let's just say he's got a lot of Joementum...  I think he is mainly dead in the water because he will be unable to raise a lot of money (by virtue of Kerry and Clinton calling on the fat cats) and is not well-positioned to go the Dean route in the absense of that.  I am just making an assumption on that one, but we shall see.  Call it a wager.<br />
<br />Warner, Richardson and Vilsack.  Ahh, we have governors this time.  Warner becomeing MORE popular in Virginia AFTER he pushed for an income tax has me all giddy.  Vilsack is DNC-ish, which I think gives him some Joementum.  Richardson has some corruption skeletons.  Warner is my guy of this bunch.  I think he has a shot.<br />
<br />For the Republicans, Condoleeza Rice will not run.  She can barely keep her composure at Senate hearings, there is no way she will feel up to the media scrutiny of a presidential run.<br />
<br />Rudy Giuliani is well-positioned to be the nominee, I think, if 9-11 can get the radical right to look past his pro-choice stance.  His history of borderline racist crime-fighting policies should help him with that crowd, too.  He seems to be the only moderate with some 9-11 swagger.  But, he is just a mayor and he's been gone for a while, too.  I also think 9-11 is fading in its power to contain the Republican domestic agenda infighting.<br />
<br />John McCain has lots of Joementum.  Really.  He is their's.<br />
<br />Brownback, Frist and Allen are the most often mentioned Senators.  I actually don't know a thing about Brownback or Allen (except that Brownback is uber-wingnutty).  I do know that Bill Frist is kidding if he thinks he has a shot.  He has about as much eloquence as one of those guys on TV selling mattresses.  <br />
<br />Newt Gingrich might be a Dean kind of guy for their side.  He would not win in November--bimbo eruption and why-did-you-end-your-marriage-when-your-wife-was-battling-cancer questions will see to that.<br />
<br />Jeb, who knows?  Would they have balls that big?<br />
<br />
<br />Ok, that is all I know.  Ya'll?</div>
