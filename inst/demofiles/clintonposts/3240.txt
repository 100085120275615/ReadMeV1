<div>I'm not back on a regular basis, but there are a few points I wanted to make after watching President Bush's State Of The Union address last night.  I haven't read any reaction anywhere on the net yet, so these points may have been covered better at other sites.<br />
<br />1) I liked Bush's rhetoric aimed at Iran.  I only hope he (and our congress and our country) is prepared to do more than talk if necessary.  There is one thing I wish he would have said when addressing Iran.  I wish he would have looked right into the camera and said, "We made sure Saddam Hussein would never be able to obtain nuclear weapons.  And, Mr. Ahmadinejad, we can do the same thing for you."<br />
<br />2) The Democrats came off looking like total jackasses.  The key moment which so clearly and succintly demonstrated the current character of the Democratic party was when Bush said, "This congress did nothing to save Social Security."  As soon as he said that, the Democrats went wild with applause.  I could almost hear their cheers: "Yay! We did nothing!  We refused to fix a problem!  Woo-hoo!!  Three cheers for obstructionism!!"  In fact, that was the only time Hillary wasn't scowling.  Which brings me to my third point.<br />
<br />3) Hillary showed her true nature on national TV.  Cold.  Condescending.  Rude.  Two instances really struck me.<br />     3a) During Bush's defense/rationale of the domestic intelligence program, he pointed out that other Presidents have done the same thing (yes, that includes Clinton).  About that time they cut to Hillary again.  She just had this little scowl/smirk look on her face and was shaking her head as if to say, "Oh, you silly little Republican.  Bill could do that because he's a Democrat.  Do you really expect the same rules apply to you?"<br />     3b) Bush made a humorous remark about the baby boomers reaching retirement. "And that includes two of my dad's favorite people.  Me and President Clinton."  Of course, just about everyone else laughed or at least chuckled.  But Hillary?  She just kept that little scowl on her face.  She couldn't even crack a polite little smile or make a half-hearted attempt at a chuckle.  (But a thought hit me in the shower this morning.  Maybe she thought Bush was talking about HER, not her husband and that it was a reference to her age and you know how sensitive women get about that!).</div>
