<div>Both Senator and ex-President Clinton had speaking dates in the Middle East this past week.  The senator spoke in Israel, praised its war on terror, and said that Israel's barrier on the West Bank is a necessary deterrent to terrorists.  The ex-President spoke in Saudi Arabia and in the UAE.  He has declared the Iraq War a mistake.  He even called many in Saddam's domestic terror apparatus "good, decent people."  He was given standing ovations by the Sunni aristocracy.  They apparently think that a Hillary Clinton presidency will mean that the US will again abandon the human rights and democracy initiative which was part of the Ford, Carter, Reagan and George HW Bush administrations.  The Clinton years were actually a retreat from this policy.  The GWB terms have seen a return of this policy, but applied as an adjunct to the war on terror, in part of the world where it was never previously applied.  The sheiks are nervous that their people may want democracy.<br />
<br />There is something unseemly, even disgusting, with the Clintons double game.  Hillary speaks in support of the war on terror.  Bill says it was a mistake.  According to Dick Morris and others, this has been their pattern for more than two years.   I think that everything Hillary says from now on should be checked against what Bill says on the same or similar subjects.  The Clintons are a package deal.</div>
