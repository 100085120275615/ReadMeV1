Esquire just recently had a survey of 1,083 men age 25 and older. One of the questions asked who you would invite to a dinner party you are hosting. Actually, there were 2 questions - one one, you could invite 3 men and the other, you could invite 3 women. The Esquire respondents broke down as follows on the women:<br /><br />Condoleezza Rice - 35%<br />Oprah Winfrey - 33%<br />Angelina Jolie - 30%<br />Julia Roberts - 28%<br />Faith Hill - 27%<br />Jennifer Aniston - 26%<br />Hillary Clinton - 21%<br />Katie Couric - 21%<br />Rachael Ray - 20%<br />Ellen DeGeneres - 19%<br />Jessica Simpson - 17%<br />Madonna - 11%<br />Dr. Laura Schlessinger - 9%<br />Maureen Dowd - 5%<br /><br />I was surprised by Rice and Winfrey being 1 and 2. I thought Jolie and Aniston might have been 1 and 2.<br /><br />Well, I have the following poll you can take. "Rock the vote" and all that stuff.<br /><br />BTW, I'm not sure who I would invite. I've narrowed it down to Rice, Winfrey, Jolie, Clinton and DeGeneres. I'm not a Bush administration fan (actually, FAR from it), but I think Rice would be interesting to talk policy. I'm also not a big lover of Winfrey, but she has been so successful, she would be interesting, too. Jolie I admire because of what she is attempting to do in third world countries. Clinton...hmmmm...the more I think about it, the less I can think why I would want her at my dinner party. Maybe I'll scratch her off the list. And DeGeneres - I like her humor and she just seems nice.<br /><br />So, who are you or who did you vote for?  Like Diebold, voting is confidential and extremely accurate (cough, cough), so if you want to vote and not comment, that's absolutely fine.  But if you want to share who you voted for, then please comment.  (Oooooo, the suspense is killing me.  I hope we don't have to do a recount - "Is that really a check or a dot or a chad...even though this is on the computer?)<br /><form action="http://poll.pollhost.com/vote.cgi" method="post"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2" width="150" border="0"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><span><b>You're hosting a dinner party and you can invite 3 women from the following list.
