<div>Congratulations to Admiral Sestak on his financial parity with Congressman Weldon it is certainly nice to have money however money does not win elections. Paul Scoles got over 35% of the vote on a campaign which lasted 45 Days. and he had very little money. Good luck to the Admiral in the Summer.<br />
<br />The latest on the deficit. The government announced that they are on track to cut deficits by 50% by 2008. This announcement was based on an unrealistic and totally inflated projection that the government created in 2004. I would like to see the following prediction come true by 2008, the elimination of budget deficit by 2008 and the surpluses that President Clinton left our country doubled thus finally paying off some of the national debt.<br />
<br />I support Hillary Clinton's initiative to provide a living wage to all Americans.<br />

<br />Respectfully Submitted<br />

<br />To the N.L. better luck next year.</div>
