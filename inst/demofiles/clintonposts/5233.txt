As if the GOP lies..and the Dems DNA that enforces them to lie is not enough to lie? Where does the American voter go to vote?<br />

To read the US Constitution we would think....oh...many a party that cares for us? The Libertarian Party? A joke of a party that has never garnered better than 1% of the Presidential vote in the 25 years? The same party that would surrender us faster to Weird Beards faster than the Dems? I think not. The MTV Party of Rose Perot? A man who never wanted to not only be President, but whose sole purpose was to screw up the comfortable Electoral Process? All for a personal vendetta against the Bushes? Thank you, Ross. You gave us Hillary as President for 8 years. And she is deinging to run for another 8 years.<br />

As Thomas Jefferson warned back in the early 1800's, this Republic should have a revolution every twenty years, and we are a good 200 years past that deadline, I myself feel that we should have a voter jihad against our own government. One that taxes us on a 55% per year basis. One that could not give a damn when our kids or grandkids will be handed an 80% effective tax rate come 2026. The kind that that Flight 93 could have relieved us, if only it had hit all it's target and relieved us of most, if not all of our Congresmen and had just flattened the building that I myself, that from age 1 to age 29,as a native DC'er,  had regarded as Freedom's Beaon. but one I know see as America's Whorehouse when it comes to our wallets, our rights and our country.
