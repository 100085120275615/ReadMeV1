Stephen Colbert<br />The only TV news pundit with balls of steel and a wit to match.<br /><br />Stephen Colbert isnât a âbrainiacâ on the ânerd patrol.â Heâs not a member of the âfactinista.â He speaks straight from the gut â you know, down where the truth is. Which is exactly what makes him so brilliant, whether heâs skewering right-wing blowhards on his Daily Show spin-off The Colbert Report or skewering President Bush right to his face. In an impressive display of range, heâs also the only person to make both this yearâs Time 100 and the Blender Hot Report. (Sorry, Archbishop Peter Akinola â thereâs always next year.)<br /><br />Hotness expiration date: 1/20/2009</blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=a1jCrDLXBfOM">Washington Lawmakers Stretch Pay With Shared Apartments, Oreos</a> Yes, folks. Not every member of Congress is rich.<br /><blockquote>For every lawmaker with a million-dollar townhouse in the Georgetown neighborhood, others live like college students when they're in the nation's capital, one of the priciest real-estate markets in the U.S.<br /><br />``For most members, it is not the life they want to lead,'' said Albert Cover, a political science professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York. ``I can't think of any other plausible reason why members would fish around toward the bottom of the rental market unless they were forced to by the costs of living in D.C.''<br /><br />Annual pay of $165,200 may not be enough for representatives and senators to maintain two households. The Constitution requires them to have a voting address in their district. That may be the family home, where wives and children often stay behind. The lawmakers, meanwhile, seek budget accommodations for the days they spend in the capital. [...]<br /><br /> Some lawmakers don't even rent apartments. Representative Jim Marshall, a Georgia Democrat, sleeps on an air mattress in his legislative office.<br /><br />``I see three or four of my colleagues bunking together in a two-bedroom apartment,'' said Marshall, 58. ``I'll go for my office any day over that.'' [...]<br /><br /> California Democrat George Miller rents space to three colleagues, Senators Charles Schumer of New York and Richard Durbin of Illinois, and Representative William Delahunt of Massachusetts, all Democrats. [...]<br /><br /> Miller and Delahunt, 65, sang the praises of Durbin as a rat catcher, something the two-term senator has had to do at least once. </blockquote><br /><br />Wanna know what Matt Lauer looks like without a shirt? <a href="http://www.tmz.com/2006/08/21/matt-lauer-is-ripped/">Click here</a>.

[...]<br /><br />Clinton said Hall of Famer Stan Musial, no surprise, was his all-time favorite Cardinals player.<br /><br />"I met him as president and he gave me a bat," he said. "That was a real thrill."<br /><br />Clinton was at the game as a fan. He signed autographs near the Mets' dugout, with guards and aides catching the many balls that fans tossed in his direction. [...]<br /><br />Before the game, Clinton and his brother, Roger, spent time with the Cardinals and Mets in their clubhouses.<br /><br />Roger Clinton seemed to especially enjoy the St. Louis portion of the tour, telling manager Tony La Russa and general manager Walt Jocketty that he attended the 1967 and 1968 World Series to root on the Cardinals.</blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.cleveland.com/weblogs/openers/index.ssf?/mtlogs/cleve_openers/archives/2006_08.html#175076">Congrats on your wedding anniversary!</a><br /><blockquote>Cleveland Congressman Dennis Kucinich, who faces re-election this year, celebrated his one-year wedding anniversary this week by sending constituents a present: A color photo of him and his wife snapped on their wedding day.<br /><br />âThis week marks for us our first wedding anniversary, a joyous moment that we would like to share with you,â he writes in the accompanying letter.<br /><br />The picture, featuring his bride Elizabeth in a wedding gown and Kucinich in a tuxedo, is the size of a baseball trading card. On the back is the prayer of St. Francis, which the two recited during their ceremony.<br /><br />While this might seem like an odd gesture, Kucinich has long history of odd gestures. He has distributed more than 16 trading cards during his political career, including his now infamous card featuring him as a 97-pound third-string quarterback for his 1960 St. John Cantius football team.</blockquote><br /><br />Remember to check out all the photos and anecdotes from Obama's <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/specials/chi-obamaafrica-htmlstory,1,4757085.special?coll=chi-news-hed">African trip</a><br /><br /><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060821/ap_on_re_us/gerald_ford">Ex-Pres Ford gets a pacemaker</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/08/21/MNGEJKM9VH1.DTL">Photog who took picture of flag-raising on Iwo Jima is dead</a>
