<div>I've been playing a lot of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas lately. It is unquestionably one of the coolest games ever made, even aside from being able to pick up hookers and slaughter innocent people with flamethrowers. The main storyline is actually pretty fucking compelling, the voice acting fucking rocks (they even got Samuel Jackson to play a major character), and the gameplay is outstanding. All this got me thinking about just how much I hate Hillary Clinton.<br />
<br />Again.<br />
<br />For those of y'all who don't remember, last summer <strike>Shitlick McCuntdrippings</strike> Hillary spearheaded the effort to have tax dollars fund an FTC investigation into San Andreas because of a hidden sex mini-game. Apparently, she was surprised that a game whose warning label said "Strong Sexual Content" actually had strong sexual content. Of course she was doing it <strike>because she's a shameless opportunist and it would give her "family values" credibility when she rides her husband's political career and runs for President</strike> for the children. I repeat - for the innocent children, who might accidentally be exposed to sex because their parents are too stupid to read the fucking rating that's already on the fucking box.  I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, how fucking bad of a parent do you have to be to buy this game for young kids, hidden sex mini-game or not?<br />One of the important characters is a <em>pimp</em> named "<em>Jizzy,</em>" and his missions involve dropping off  and protecting hookers.  There's a string of missions about delivering two tons of weed to plant on a D.A. that's getting too nosy.  Some of the stats the game keeps track of are "Strip Club Budget" and "Prostitute Budget."  And, of course, murder and theft are your bread and butter in the game.  If you buy this game for your kindergartener, you are a bad person - and that's coming from <em>me</em>.<br />
<br />Anyway, I've got to get going.  Really, I think I just wanted to say that I hope Hillary Clinton gets cancer before she runs in '08, because I really don't want to have to listen to her self-righteous noise for an entire fucking election season.  Fuck it.</div>
