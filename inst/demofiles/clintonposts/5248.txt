Bloomberg reports that William <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=washingtonstory&sid=afgZZj1sxB5w#<br />"><br />"><br />">Buckley Calls Clinton a Contender to Be President</a><br /><br />"William F. Buckley Jr., the longtime conservative writer and leader, said that while a strong Republican candidate for the 2008 presidential race has yet to emerge, the Democrats have in Senator Hillary Clinton a true contender to become the first woman elected U.S. president."<br /><br />I note this because I like celebrating distinctive non-partisan civility and candor.<br />He didn't have to say anything flattering but he did note that "Her thought is kind of woozy left, not in my judgment threatening."<br /><br />Perhaps he was referring to her relatively moderate political temperament which I also notice and appreciate.
