<a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/6/4/134702.shtml?s=ic">Canadian Politician Denies Clinton Affair<br /><br /><blockquote>Billionaire Belinda Stronach insists there is nothing true about the rumors she and former President Clinton are having an affair, adding that it's all a Republican plot.</a><br /><br /></blockquote><br />You know I do not believe that Clinton has had an affair with Belinda.  But come on Belinda a Republican conspiracy, I think someone is suffering from megalomania (did I use this word in the right context?)<br /><br /><br />Anyway, even if the Republicans were plotting against you to get Bill, one question still remainsâ¦why?  Bill is out of politics and Hillary is the one making the presidential run and if memory serves correctly every time Bill has had sexual relations with another women and then denied it is Hillary's popularity that goes up.  This is the first time in over a decade that the Republicanâs want Bill to keep his pants on.  You know the more I think of it, this could be a Democrat conspiracy.
