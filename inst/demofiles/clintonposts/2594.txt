<p>After reading several of my post-travel entries recently, I had to laugh when I noticed the words *relaxed and refreshed* pop up regularly.&nbsp; Having just returned from a nine day road trip...solitary...those aren't the words that come to mind today.&nbsp; *Coma* is closer to it.&nbsp; 1,838 miles.&nbsp; Indiana to Pennsylvania, to New York City, to Baltimore, back to New York City, back to Pennsylvania and, finally, back to the heartland.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Most of the trip was family-family-family, but since my New York City connection will soon be history, I tried to make the most of it, darting from favorite to favorite and managing, <em>somehow</em>, to even squeeze in a <a href="http://www.cathkidston.com/">few</a> <a href="http://www.knittycity.com/">fun</a> <a href="http://www.tinseltrading.com/">spots</a> that I hadn't visited before.&nbsp; </p>

<p>When I walked up to Purl Patchwork, several women were admiring <a href="http://www.purlbee.com/home/2006/8/3/welcome-to-the-purl-bee.html">Hillary's wee kitty</a> in the window.&nbsp; The shop's selection was fresh and inviting and although I was determined to resist, I did indulge in several pieces from <a href="http://www.purlsoho.com/purl/products/fabricdetail/1724">these</a> <a href="http://www.purlsoho.com/purl/products/fabricdetail/1723">two</a> new lines of fabric.&nbsp; Does everyone know that Joelle has gotten the <a href="http://www.purlsoho.com/purl/products/fabric">Purl Patchwork website</a> up and running now?&nbsp; &nbsp;(Just in time for me, now that K is moving and I'm losing my NYC crash pad.)&nbsp; In addition to fabric, PP is carrying quite a few patterns, too.&nbsp; Recognize the <a href="http://bemused.typepad.com/bemused/2006/06/flitting_around.html">butterfly blocks</a> in the little quilt hanging by the counter?&nbsp; I had a lot of inquiries about the pattern and now it's available <a href="http://www.purlsoho.com/purl/products/patternlist/company,149,,type,patchwork">here</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

<p>It wasn't all shopping and ethnic dining though.&nbsp; After a longer-than-planned Sunday stroll through a very lively Central Park, I headed to <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/">the Met</a>.&nbsp; With limited time before closing, I made a beeline to my favorite galleries, <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/introduction.asp?dep=5">PreColumbian</a> and <a href="http://www.metmuseum.org/Works_of_Art/introduction.asp?dep=17">Medieval</a>.&nbsp; Here are just a few of the charming pieces that I could have brought home.&nbsp; You know.&nbsp; If I <strong>could</strong> have.</p>

<p>From the sublime to the ridiculous, my last (notable) adventure was a trip to <a href="http://www.ikea.com/">Ikea</a> with my sister in Baltimore.&nbsp; Since I've never lived in an Ikea area (though have managed many stops in my travels over the years), I'm the first one in the car at the mere suggestion of an outing.&nbsp; It wasn't long before we were weeding through a veritable mountain of rag rugs.</p>

<p>The weeds seem to have taken my leave as a signal to procreate wildly so I'm heading out to get things under control.&nbsp; Then a little tidying up around here and tomorrow I may be back to my routine.&nbsp; Such as it is.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p></div>
