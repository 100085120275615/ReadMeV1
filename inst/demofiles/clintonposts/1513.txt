<p>I'll have to obtain a copy of this Time piece, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/08/20/coverstory.tm/index.html">but from the excerpt I read </a>it's a clear indication that Hillary will be running. Check this out..</p>

<blockquote>Against virtually nonexistent opposition for her Senate seat, she is raising money as though she were in the fight of her life, bringing in more than $33 million. What's left over -- which might easily be $10 million or more -- could be the seed money for a presidential campaign. 

<p>And as her husband did the year before launching his 1992 bid for the presidency, she has been putting together the intellectual pieces of a campaign agenda in a series of centrist, high-fiber speeches around energy policy, the economy, privacy and even rural issues.</p>

<p>Her political operation has grown to an army of 32 full-time employees, plus 10 from her Senate office who draw part of their salary there, and 13 consultants who are building, among other things, a national direct-mail operation. She recently added an Internet guru to their ranks.</p>

<p>And offering his services for free is the best Democratic political strategist on the planet: Bill Clinton is "thinking about [her presidential prospects] all the time," says one of Hillary's advisers. "He's thinking about it and talking to a lot of people, promoting Hillary. This is something he is very focused on."</blockquote></p>

<p>This is like a military buildup folks. It's like watching an army massing on another countries border. You know what they are preparing to do. In this case, Hillary is building up her forces to be able to take out any Democrat who chooses to get in her way come 2008. Can you imagine this scenario. Hillary could attend a big bucks fundraiser in New York, while at the same time, Bill could be running one out in Hollywood. With this couple, you have a two for one deal. This is another advantage to HIllary in that she already has her Presidential ticket set. LOL</p>

<p>In the end I believe Hillary's ability to generate gobs of money will eventually be too much for other Democrats to handle, while the strongest one left in the end might get a shot at being the VP. Of course we all know who the real vice president will be.  ;)</p>

<p>This same time article also shows new poll numbers for Hillary that show her faring better than any of her potential rivals when matched against Senator John MccCain. My question is, why just Mccain? What happened to Giuliani? A Giuliani win in the state of New York would spell total doom for Hillary. I guess bringing that up might ruin the excitement that maybe this piece was intended to garner? ;)</p>
