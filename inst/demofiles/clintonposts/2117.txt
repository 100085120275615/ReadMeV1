<br />I<span> have to tell you that </span>

<span>Lee</span>

<span> is always posting something that makes me think of my mama* or my grandma. In this pic, my mama kind of looks like my grandma, only not nearly as much grey hair as my grandma had. And go figure why my sister and my mama are the only ones smiling and looking at the photographer (if memory serves me correctly, Mr. Wonderful shot this one).<br />

<span>, Lee's posts about growing up in North Carolina are very deep Southern subjects that totally scream "maah mahmah" (*that's the proper way to say "my mama" in the South, I think. But all Southerners are invited to correct my if I'm wrong, 'cuz I'm a Yankee, so WTF do I know).<br />
<br />Funny thing how Celtic music and Southern music are so similar...playing fiddles, the jiggy dancing....I guess it was inevitable that my parents would meet. My dad is from Utica, NY, but strangely, he had quite the connection with my mama after they both had been transplanted into Hoosierland. And here lies the Welsh woman who started it all on my dad's side of the family, my great grandmother Annie:<br />

<br />See, in Wales, it was normal to name a girl Annie, and to the best of my knowledge, Southerners do the same if they are so inclined.<br />
<br />Yeah, this post is whack. So I invite you to make comments in mama-thon mode. Sen. Hillary R. Clinton would love it ;)</span>
