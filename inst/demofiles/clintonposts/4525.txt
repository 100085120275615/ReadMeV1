<p>I can be extraordinarily lazy when it comes to girl stuff.  This wasnât always the case â my mom is one of those women who does not leave the house unless she is perfectly dressed, made up and accessorized, which meant that I was raised to not leave the house unless I was perfectly dressed, made up and accessorized.   My mom and I had different ideas about how I should dress and look, but in my way I was very well put together.  Then I got to college and after a couple of weeks of showing up to class all dressed up, I realized everyone else was in jeans and sweats.  The realization that I could knock a bunch of time off my morning routine and sleep later hit like a lightning bolt, and the less fancy Hillary was born.  Wearing makeup and my contacts became more of a going out occurrence.  Of course, I went out a lot in college, so really I just shifted to being well groomed at night, I guess.  In a baby doll dress, black tights and Doc Martens kind of way.  Usually with a lot of black eyeliner.  </p>

<p>Anyway, I generally take a more minimalist approach these days.  Iâm perfectly presentable, but I got into the habit of skimping on the details.   Now I find that as Iâm getting in shape and losing weight, Iâm becoming more interested clothes and makeup again.  This weekend I reconnected with my girlie side in a big way.  On Saturday I made my semi-annual trip to get my hair cut and highlighted.  As a bonus, I now have so much grey hair that I have to have dye added in between the highlights.  Stupid grey hair.  Itâs nice to go to the salon to get fussed over.  Expensive, but totally worth it â curly hair is tricky to cut, and Iâm picky about who does my color.  Plus I really like my hair stylist.  Sheâs fun.</p>

<p>After the salon I headed over to Nordstrom where I bought what may be the most beautiful pair of pumps I have ever owned.  As I was trying them on, complete strangers commented on how great they are.  Even John, who wouldnât care if I strapped actual shoe boxes to my feet instead of shoes, recognized how gorgeous these shoes are.  Donât you just love them?  Thank you, Michael Kors.</p>

Then I went and made the girl at the Smashbox counterâs day by getting color correcting primer (Iâm so tired of the red undertone from my rosacea), foundation, a foundation brush, eyeliner, eye shadow and lip gloss.  </p>

<p>It was an enjoyable and satisfying day and Iâm looking forward to doing it again. Iâm not saying that Iâll completely abandon my minimalist side, but Iâm going to have fun embracing my girlie side too.</p>
