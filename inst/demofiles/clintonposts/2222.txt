One of the missiles was the âTaep-A-Dongâ rumored to have the capability to penetrate the mainland United States. The US responded by activating the ballistic missile interceptor system despite itâs developmental status. One high level Pentagon staffer was quoted as saying âThe interceptors would be operational already if President Clinton hadnât restricted its budget to a trickle and allowed it to be used for research only!â. President Bush called the launch of the Taep-A-Dong âa provocative actâ and warned that North Korea was walking a dangerous path.<br />
<p>Democrat Senator Hillary Clinton from New York said âyes I find it provocative! I find it very provocative!â her face flushed with apparent anger. She went onâ¦<br />
<br />"Iâll tell you something else! If I were Kim Jong Il and I had my own Taep-A-Dong and Ellen Degeneres was Japan, Iâd use that Taep-A-Dong to make her call me âmasterâ. And, you know what else? Letâs say I was North Korea with that huge Taep-A-Dong and Angelina Jolie was like the United States. Iâd be so, so pissed at her for all her natural resources and her ability to attract men that Iâd take that Taep-A-Dong and really damage her with it! â¦ â¦ â¦ I guess what Iâm trying to say is that we shouldnât judge North Korea too hastily. Sheâ¦heâ¦itâ¦is doing what any one of us would do if we were as under-developed as North Korea relative to the rest of the world!" </p>
<p>In unrelated news, Angelina Jolie has cancelled her plans to attend the âHillary Now!â fundraiser this weekend in Washington D.C. â¦ Meanwhile Ellen Degeneres has been holding a solitary candlelight vigil outside of Senator Clintonâs Washington office in what is presumed to be an anti-war protest. </p>
