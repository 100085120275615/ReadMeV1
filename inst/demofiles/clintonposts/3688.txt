<div>Today's a good day for the Opinion sections of major national newspapers. First, the <i>LA Times</i> publishes Ezra's excellent <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oe-klein22aug22,1,3950861.story?track=rss">op-ed</a> arguing that Hillary should forgo a presidential run to become Senate Majority Leader. Agreed, for all the reasons he states. Next up is the <i>NY Times</i>' <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/opinion/22tue1.html?ex=1313899200&en=ec53e7572d1e621b&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss">editorial</a> about the need to intervene militarily in cases of genocide, even after Iraq. It's an excellent rejoinder to the <a href="http://minipundit.typepad.com/minipundit/2006/03/fukuyama_vs_joh.html">Johnsonite</a> left. Read it.</div>
