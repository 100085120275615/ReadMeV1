<div>Goes to Amy over at <a href="http://angrychicken.typepad.com/angry_chicken/">Angry Chicken</a>.  But you all knew that anyway, huh?  Here's the thing about all my bloggy girls.  They are all so nice!  And interested in the same things that I'm interested in!  I think that was the most wonderful thing for me way back when I discovered <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/">Hillary</a>.  Probably the most exciting internet experience for me-ever!  I don't know any women in real life that get excited over learning to insert an invisible zipper or about finishing a family of softie whales or in creating a studio space.  Except for me, that is.  Finding these kindred spirits on the web has truly been a God send.  So nice to know I am not alone.  This sounds weird, but their presence helps me through bad days.  Their upbeat attitudes and "can do" creativity just lifts me up.  And that's all I have to say about that.</div>
