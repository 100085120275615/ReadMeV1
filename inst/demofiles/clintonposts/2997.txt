<div>Dear Tulsa Republican Party Leadership,<br />
<br />You will find that grassroots Republicans in Tulsa are:<br />First â Christians.<br />Second â Socially Conservative.<br />Third â Fiscally Conservative<br />Lastly, IF the party matches up with the first three, then Republicans.<br />
<br />We have no loyalty to the Republican Party; instead we have firm principles, and we will support whoever best represents those principles regardless of their party.  It is for that reason that I never have, and probably never will, give money to the local Republican Party because I cannot trust that it will always be used to support candidates that I support.  Instead, I contribute directly to the candidates and causes that do match my principles.<br />
<br />Similarly, I will not support a candidate who does not match my principles regardless of who endorses him.<br />
<br />Bill LaFortune has demonstrated over four years that he will not stand up for his beliefs as a Christian.  (Example: LaFortuneâs support of Tulsa Talks, the OCCJ, and of other religions to the exclusion of Christianity at the zoo.)<br />Bill LaFortune has demonstrated over four years that he is not socially conservative.  (Example: LaFortuneâs support of Tulsa Talks and similar gay and Muslim causes that seek to indoctrinate our children.)<br />Bill LaFortune has demonstrated over four years that he is not fiscally conservative.<br />(Example: LaFortuneâs support of Vision 2025 and, well, do we need anything else?)<br />
<br />Bill LaFortune is not a genuine Christian, or a social or fiscal conservative.  He in no way matches my values and beliefs, and as such I cannot support Bill LaFortune.<br />
<br />Letâs get our own (Republican) house in order; then we can unite to defeat Hillary Clintonâ¦I mean, her sister, Kathy Taylor.<br />
<br />Sincerely,<br />
<br />Your Grassroots Support</div>
