<strong>Week Two Features Razor-Thin Margins in Clinton-Rendell, Edwards-Obama, Kucinich-Ford, and Gore-Emanuel Match-Ups</strong><br /><br />By ADVOCATE STAFF<br /><br />In Week Two of voting for The Nashua Advocate's Presidential March Madness, voters suddenly turned deadly serious, uprooting low-seeded upstarts from the competition at an alarming rate.<br /><br />Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell?<br /><br />Gone.<br /><br />Arizona Governor Janet Napolitano?<br /><br />Gone.<br /><br />Tennessee Representative Harold Ford, Jr.? Illinois Representative Rahm Emanuel?<br /><br />Gone, gone.<br /><br />Meanwhile, much of the remaining field--Clinton, Dean, Gore--reads like a roster of Democratic Party stalwarts.<br /><br />And then there's Obama, who seems to us both a stalwart and an upstart at the same time.<br /><br />So, without further ado, here are the winners and losers from Week Two, along with the week's highlights and awards. Also below are the brackets for Week Three, which officially begins <strong>right now</strong>.<br /><br />Instructions for voting are at the base of this article.<br /><br />[We note here, for all you technophobes out there, that voting is <strong>easy</strong>, and requires merely sending an e-mail with your picks to our e-mail address, nashuaadvocate@yahoo.com].<br /><br />Week Three voting will close, and all Week Three results will be posted, in one week.<br /><br />Let the voting begin!<br /><br /><em>[EDITOR'S NOTE (5/1/05): As with last week's polling, this week you will once again find active links to information on each of the candidates who survived Week Two, and who therefore now face elimination (or advancement to the Final Four) in Week Three.<br /><br />Please remember, also, that we invite, separately from your Week Three votes (albeit in the same e-mail), your nomination of any person for "Top Write-In Candidate for 2008."<br /><p>To find the original post for Week One, click <a href="http://nashuaadvocate.blogspot.com/2005/04/great-debate-who-will-save-democratic.html">here</a>.
