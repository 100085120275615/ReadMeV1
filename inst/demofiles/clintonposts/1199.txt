Weld, the New York-born-and-raised ex-governor of Massachusetts, has said he plans to seek the Republican nomination in New York's gubernatorial race to succeed the retirning George Pataki.<br /><br />Despite Weld's New York bonafides, he's known as a New England guy. But New York voters rarely hold it against someone from outside the Empire State trying to use them for political gain.<br /><br />Democrat Bobby Kennedy of Massachusetts was our most prominent carpetbagger in the late 20th century, setting up a <br />tenuous-at-best residence in New York so he could qualify to run for one of our U.S. Senate seats.<br /><br />Democrat Hillary Clinton picked up that torch for the 21st when she replicated the feat even though she had never lived here <br />and knew next to nothing about the state.<br /><br />Weld was born in Smithtown, Long Island, raised there, owns several properties in the state, and is in business in New York as a principal in an equity investment firm. So, Weld probably has had New York on his mind for quite a while, right? Not if you check the Brainy Quote site on the Web and find this utterance in a collection of Weld quotes compiled over the past several years:<br /><br />"I have ruled out everything except a possible run for governor of New York in 2006, and I don't think even that is very likely.''<br /><br />Murky. All very murky. Made even murkier if you recall an Associated Press story that began "The same day former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld said he was interested in running for governor of New York, an internal memo to partners in his investment firm flatly discounted any such bid.<br /><br />"The two-paragraph April 26 memo from Leeds Weld & Co. stated, in part: 'While it has always been Bill's practice "never to say never," -- there's that phrase again -- 'Bill is not running for governor of New York or for any other office."<br /><br />But wait. That story did not come out last week when the Weld camp said he would seek the governor's office. It was published on May 11, two weeks after Weld told the AP he was seriously considering the New York race of Pataki decided not to run. That turnaround came more than three months before the latest turnaround,  <br /><br />Of course, murkiness becomes murkier than ever because of the petty personality-driven nature of politics.<br /><br />Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the New York State Senate, has his nose out of joint because Weld hadn't <br />journeyed upstate to Brunswick to kiss Joe's ring before going public with his political goals. That slight was exacerbated by the fact Weld has done plenty of other political smooching, mostly in the Big Apple area.<br /><br />"I don't have a clue as to what he's doing, or what he's about or where he lives,'' Bruno fumed the other day. "If I haven't heard from him, he's not going to hear from me.'<br /><br />If any of that were true, we'd be shocked.<br /><br />Bruno is one of the most powerful political leaders in the state. If he doesn't have a clue what Weld is up to, his political <br />antennae have withered or he has developed a reading impairment. And, although Bruno may not personally be calling Weld to repair the emerging rift, you can be sure communication has been established between the two camps, if only to let Weld know he has made a strategic faux pas.<br /><br />It's too bad Weld isn't running against Hillary for the Senate seat up for grabs next year. Two people who made their political bones on stages other than New York seeing to represent the state.<br /><br />Now, <i>that</i> would have been poetic justice.
