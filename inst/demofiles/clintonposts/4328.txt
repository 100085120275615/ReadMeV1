<p><p>On the way home from work I listened to Michael Medved&#8217;s show. I do this because it&#8217;s funny to hear the smug little prick squirm when even the not-so-bright talk radio callers outwit this self-styled intellectual.</p></p>
<p><p>Today&#8217;s guest was David Horowitz, a former commie/ Black Panther groupie who think his transformation into a neo-Nazi is a change for the better, and proprietor of a website that runs columns by Holocaust deniers and shits on the graves of Holocaust victims and survivors. This time, for a change of pace, Horowitz decided to smear a living Holocaust survivor: George Soros, who only survived because his well-to-do family bribed Christian families to take them in and pass off the 13-year-old Soros as one of their own. For this, Medved and Horowitz accused Soros of being &#8220;assimilated&#8221; to Naziism (I guess that makes Anne Frank an &#8220;assimilated Nazi&#8221; too, since she was hidden by Christians from the Nazis.).</p></p>
<p><p>They also accused him of being behind all sorts of hellish plots to make money by destroying America, legalizing weed and joining a coven of other &#8220;leftists&#8221; like the Baba Yaga of American politics: Hillary Clinton. They also accused him of being behind the defeat of Sore Loserman in Connecticut with his sinister money and front groups. In other words, they dipped their hands into the sewer for every Jew-baiting piece of crap to fling at him except the one about him killing Christian babies to make matzo.</p></p>
<p><p>Where did Horowitz come up with the sources for this avalanche of horseshit? There are four main ones:</p></p>
<p><p>Laurie Mylroie, who claims Saddam Hussein blew up the World Trade Center on 9-11 and is responsible for every other vile deed she can think of; Lyndon LaRouche, his own neo-Nazi website, and straight out of his ass.</p></p>

<p><p>To top it off, Medved and Horowitz smeared Soros as a self-hating Jew. Like two I could name who traffic in anti-Semitic stereotypes to paint a Jewish businessman as Super Shylock? I&#8217;m no apologist for Soros or any other zillionaire who moves his money offshore to dodge taxes, but this has the be the most repulsively anti-Semitic thing I&#8217;ve ever heard on the radio -even outdoing the Savage Wiener&#8217;s diatribes that must have sounded better in the original German.</p></p>
<p><p>No wonder Michael Medved is such a shameless apologist and fanwhore for Mel Gibson.</p>
