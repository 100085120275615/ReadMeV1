<p>Bush talking about AIDS</p>
<p>Bush singing <em>Imagine+Take a walk on the wild side</em></p>
<p>Bush singing <em>Sunday Bloody Sunday</em></p>
<p>Bush singing <em>Who&#8217;s the Nigga</em></p>
<p>Bush singing <em>Birthday PartyMix</em></p>
<p>Bush singing about Drugs</p>
<p>(and more, like Kerry, Dick is a killer, Hillary, Xmas&#8230;)</p>
<p>My favourites? ALL! (but I like the rithm in My name is RX, and I love the Martin Luther King speech -except the God stuff-).
