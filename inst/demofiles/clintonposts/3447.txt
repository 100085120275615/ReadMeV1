<div>Oh! Did I not just call it? Who's the man! Oh yeah!<br />
<br />Enough of my own esteem boosting ways. Harriett Miers was nominated as new Justice of the Supreme Court. If confirmed by the senate, she will take the place of retiring justice Sandra Day O'Conner, to become the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court. The second woman, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, is still serving as Justice.<br />
<br />Harriet Miers is now the former White House Counsell and was the first woman to lead the Texas Bar Association. She is a very well known lawyer and was voted one of the top 100 lawyers of our time. She has been described as "fiesty", but signs point to showing that she will be someone that would stick to the laws of the constitution.<br />
<br />She has no former judicial experience, but is well-known for her unrelentless court room personality and her time served as White House Counsel, which was previously held by current Attorney General, Alberto Gonzalez.<br />
<br />Bush made sure to consult with over 80 senators, as to who they believe would make a good justice. I believe that Dubya has done a very good job with his Supreme Court nominees. Both are renowned for there fairness and there adhesivness to the Constitution. Many thought that Bush would lean to a strictly conservative aimed judge, but did not.<br />
<br />John Roberts won confirmation by a staggering 78-22 vote. Those who voted against him were the typical senators who would rather kill a woman in a drunken haze then to vote on a Bush Nominee. Among those were Hillary Clinton and Teddy Kennedy. Both who were not driven by doing the right thing for the country, but the right thing for themselves by making a partisan vote.<br />
<br />Adding Harriett Miers makes the Supreme Court stats look something like this: 4 conservatives, 4 liberals, and 1 moderate. George W. really did do a good job adding a new balance to the american judicial system.</div>
