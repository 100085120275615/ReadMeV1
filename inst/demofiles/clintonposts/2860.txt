<div>A reporter friend asked me to comment about a story he is writing about the tension between Clinton's two great desires:<ul>
<li>To be a beloved post-partisan ex-president helpful in all the world statements-type responses to international events</li>
<br />
<li>To be the Democratic Party's unofficial leader and first-ever First Gentleman</li>
</ul>I think that Bill Clintonâs legacy would be enhanced if his immediate political activities were more altruistic than helping his wife get elected.<br />
<br />The new president has a lot to repair both within and outside the US.  He or she should have the best team and support with the least diversion of attention to scrapping and other shenanigans.<br />
<br />Hence my suggestion that Clinton draft (and craft) Gore and participate in the solutions rather than contributing to the problems.  Insuring that a Democratic President gets elected and a get-things-done team of straight shooters is placed is far more important in this next cycle than electing Hillary (who, in my opinion, is not the right person for this particular time).<br />
<br />Gore has a passion to effect change regarding our immediate environmental problems and he has knowledge and experience with cleaning up our government and extricating all of the cancerous corruption, evil policies, poison pills and hateful and wrongheaded initiatives that the present administration has embedded.  Heâs not a corrupt man and has the integrity to remain so.  With the Clintons onboard as UN Ambassador and Secretary of Health and Human Services (for example) everyone would see by their selfless example that repairing our country is far more important than any sense of entitlement or legacy building.<br />
<br />What better legacy than that?http://rpc.technorati.com/rpc/ping
