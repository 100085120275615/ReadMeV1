<p>Here is my response to <a href="http://www.slweekly.com/editorial/2006/edit_2006-08-17.cfm">this article in Salt Lake City Weekly </a>
</p>  <p>
<br /> </p>  <p>  Dear Ben, just read your latest rant about the War on Terrorism. A great addition to the diseducation of the American mind if I may say. I am a resident of Utah, American, with Arab-Palestinian heritage. I grew up in the Middle East under martial and Islamic laws for 32 years of my life. I live and work in ****** now. In response to your article let me say the following:</p>  <p>1. Thank god that the left in this country has finally admitted that Bill Clinton made a mistake in the war on terrorism. Forget about Bin Laden and let's talk Arafat, the late chief of terrorism in the region. The man who usurped the fortunes of the Palestinian people and flushed their cause down the toilet. It was Billy boy who put that thief and his thugs in power, giving him legitimacy and power. Look where we are now, thanks to that fatal mistake. Whether Billy boy made the mistake deliberately or not he still made a big mistake by talking to Arafat to start with rather than insisting on talking to a Palestinian elected from within the Palestinians living in the West Bank and insisting on the correctly held position of the US government then that the PLO is a terrorist organization. As a former Palestinian I tell you that any dream I had of peace died the day Arafat and his people were given power over me and my family.</p>  <p>2. Whether you agree or disagree with the Military's decision to fire homosexuals who speak Arabic from the military, the fact that you guys on the left ignore to mention is that this is NOT the end of the guy's career. I work closely with military linguists and let me tell you that the guy has just gotten the biggest pay raise if his life. Titan, L3 and other companies will be offering him six figure incomes to join them, not to mention other government agencies that will be salivating to get him in. You should be happy for the guy! I assure you that his skills will be used and reused for national security.</p>  <p>3.  I don't know if you read Arabic or not Ben but I do. I can actually send you some published articles in Arabic, written by Al Qaeda and the Arab media detailing how our fight in Iraq is directing all of Al Qaeda;'s resources towards that war rather than investing it in operations in America. The fact that they are and have been developing homegrown terrorists in Europe and the West is not new and they have been seeking it from the very beginning. The homegrowns are young people who have been indoctrinated and are usually over enthusiastic and sloppy. They had lower quality training or no training in those camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the main reason for that is the fact that the qualified trainers and leaders of Al Qaeda are all in Iraq fighting the US. There is a lot of literature out there about that and it is in Arabic unfortunately but I can still mail you some if you would pay for a translator.</p>  <p>4.I read the TIME magazine article you refer to and the fact that they said the gibberish does not mean it is true. Go to Google Video and search for a movie called Relentless. You will find a plethora of documentary evidence in that documentary with TV recordings of Hezbollah's leader giving speeches about America as an enemy and his desire to bring death to America. Again, if you read Arabic I can send you links to Hezbollah's website to read some of the stuff they spout there. HAMAS, Hezbollah, Al Qaeda are all the same in purpose despite being different organizations and if they have the chance they will cooperate against the US. Their ultimate goal is to bring Islamic government to the whole world and the creed they use from the Koran says that they should not stop Jihad until all people on earth believe in Islam. The fact that Al Qaeda has been semi-paralyzed by the war in Iraq prevents them from doing that. We still have to worry about Russia, Iran and China though because they seem to be in bed with Hezbollah.</p>  <p>5. Finally, I am so grateful that the left is not in power in this country. I reached this conclusion on September 11th as I was in the Middle East and saw the Arabs celebrating the tragedy. Having witnessed the lack of response by Clinton to any of Bin Laden's previous acts I was glad that this cowboy is in power. I have to say that I am very disappointed with the left in this country. The terrorists know about the weakness and lack of decision on the left. It would please you to know that people like Lemont, Hillary Clinton, Jimmy Carter and the Daily Kos blog are favorite sources of quotations on Al Qaeda and other Islamist blogs and websites. Every time I go on one of those Arabic Islamist websites it amazes me how heavily leftist blogs and media are  quoted there. The terrorists are watching November very closely and a vote for the left anti-war movement will be heralded in Islamic media as a win and will lead to increased terrorism in the hope that they can force the left to withdraw from Iraq. They tried the formula before in 1982 when the blew up the Marines barracks in Beirut and the Democrat -lead Congress then forced Reagan to withdraw from Lebanon and they tried it in Somalia when they burned a few soldiers and Clinton withdrew. A vote for the left is a vote for an increase in terrorism and is supported by historical causality and statements made by Al Qaeda and other terror groups.</p>  <br /> <p></p>
