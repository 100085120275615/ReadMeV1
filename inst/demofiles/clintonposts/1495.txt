<br /><div align="justify"><a href="http://www.lifenews.com">Lifenews.com</a> points out that the FDA is now pushing for over-the-counter sales of the morning after pill, known as Plan B.  They appear to be holding their fingers up to the wind in order to make that decision.   Are they considering ethics at all in this matter?<br /><br /><a href="http://lifenews.com/nat2469.html">Article</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.Dictionary.com">Dictionary.com</a> defines ethical as the following:<br /><br />1) Of, relating to, or dealing with ethics. <br />2) Being in accordance with the accepted principles of right and wrong that govern the conduct of a profession. See Synonyms at moral. <br />3) Of or relating to a drug dispensed solely on the prescription of a physician.<br /><br />Don't you think definition number 3 is interesting considering the current debate?  The pro-abortion industry wants a pharmacist to dispense a drug which could kill the person taking it or the person who might be born.  Since when did pharmacists become doctors?  The last time you picked up a prescription, did the pharmacist ask you if you were diabetic or if you had any other problems that might cause you to have a reaction to the drug that they are giving you?  No, they expect the physician to have already done that for you.  All they do is put pills in a bottle, after which a front desk clerk takes your money for them.<br /><br />Morally, we know that this decision is wrong, just like we know abortion is wrong.  There is no room for debate on this topic.  Plan B kills human beings.  Period.<br /><br />Yet many seek to debate the topic nonetheless.  Not only that, moral and ethical issues are being turned over to public opinion.<br /><br />"The FDA also said Monday it had reviewed 47,000 public comments on the morning after pill and that the majority of them supported the drug."<br /><br />Just because people wanted blacks to drink at different fountains or to sit at the back of the bus, didn't make it ok.  Just because Germans wanted to incinerate Jews and use them for soap or other decorations didn't mean it was ok.  Just because we want to stop pregnancy by all means necessary doesn't mean it's ok.<br /><br />America is not mob rule, we are supposed to be a country that stands above all other countries.  Too often we see representatives basing their decisions on polls, not on right & wrong.  President Clinton was famous for making decisions with his finger to the wind.<br /><br />The lies in the media, from doctors and from our elected representatives would have us believe that Plan B is not an abortion drug like RU486.  Unfortunately they omit important parts in their argument on purpose.  An example is this is in a debate which was held a couple of days ago with Charmaine Yoest from the Family Research Council and Melanie Drnach, a representative from NOW.<br /><br /><strong>Plan B Debate on CNBC</strong>  Click twice slowly to play (Internet Explorer & Windows only)<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />SRC="http://www.charmaineyoest.com/2006/july/CharmaineCNBC073107.wmv"<br />WIDTH="320"<br />HEIGHT="320"<br />AUTOSTART="0"<br />SHOWCONTROLS="1"><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Charmaine</strong> - I was under the impression that it was the FDAâs responsibility to make sure that prescription drugs are only getting into the hands of the people who are supposed to get them.  This is really, really shocking and horrifying.  You know, these groups that are pushing for this are not out there lobbying to see the pill over the counter.  Thereâs a good reason for that.  Itâs because there are serious health consequences associated with (not understood).<br /><br />Kudlow asks âIs there a health risk, this is an unsupervised procedure.  Is there a health risk to women in your view?â<br /><br /><strong>Melody </strong> - Letâs be very clear, this is not a procedure and it is not risky, it is simply an extra strong dose of birth control.  Thatâs all this is.  Birth control pills in a strong form to prevent unintended pregnanciesâ<br /><br />Really?  The birth control pill isnât dangerous?  Outside of the fact that it kills babies, what more does it do to women?  What about these known problems?<br /><br />Increased risk of breast cancer <br />Increased risk of blood clotting, heart attack and stroke <br />Migraines <br />Gall bladder disease <br />Increased blood pressure <br />Weight gain <br />Mood changes <br />Nausea Irregular bleeding or spotting <br />Benign liver tumors <br />Breast tenderness<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cancer.org/docroot/NWS/content/NWS_1_1x_Cervical_Cancer_Linked_To_Birth_Control_Pills.asp">Letâs not forget cervical cancer.</a><br /><br />âResearchers from the International Agency on Cancer Research in Lyon, France, found that the risk increased by more than 50% after five years of oral contraceptive use, and more than doubled after 10 years. The study was published in The Lancet (Vol. 361, No. 9364: 1159-1167)."<br /><br />Cervical cancer is a relatively uncommon cancer in the United States. It will be diagnosed in about 12,000 American women in 2003, according to American Cancer Society estimates, and it will kill about 4,000 women. Cervical cancer is not among the top 10 cancers in American women, mainly because of early detection through Pap tests.â<br /><br />Go ahead, roll the dice.  Itâs your life right?<br /><br />So, an âstrong doseâ of birth control pills a couple times a month wonât be bad?  Later on Melody makes the statement âIâm not a doctorâ.  Yet she has no problem telling us that Plan B isnât dangerous?<br /><br />Charmaine follows up with - âMelody, I think that is absolutely shocking for you to make that kind of statement.  You have to have a doctors supervision to take these drugs.  You canât take the pill if you have (?) disease, if you have diabetes.  Are you aware that the Centers for Disease Control says that there are 500,000 women in this country who donât know that they have diabetes?â<br /><br /><strong>Melody</strong> - âCharmaine, I am not a doctor.  Unless youâre a medical doctor that can speak to that...I am not a doctor.  I rely on the scientists...I rely on the scientists.  The overwhelming scientific medical experts who testified and who are employed by the FDA...this is not an abortion.  This is intended to prevent pregnancy.  <br /><br /><strong>Charmaine</strong> - âThis is letting the abortion controversy cloud womenâs health issuesâ<br /><br /><strong>Melody</strong> - âBe very careful in your wording, this is birth control, this is not abortionâ<br /><br /><strong>Kudlow</strong> - âDoes this pill affect promiscuity and other sexual mores?â<br /><br />Melody now tells us how she is an expert in sociology.<br /><br /><strong>Melody</strong> - âAbsolutely not, absolutely not.  It is not going to entice young women and young men to engage in risky behavior because a extra dose of birth control can help prevent an unintended pregnancy.  Of everything, I would think that groups out there would be supportive of this because our goal is to reduce abortions, and this is an absolutely sound, safe, accurate way to do soâ<br /><br />When asked if this drug will cause more or fewer abortions, Charmaine points out that âin Europe where it has been legal, there has been an actually an increase in abortionâ<br /><br />Also - Charmaine - âIn actual fact, this drug does, in some instances, cause an abortionâ<br /><br /><strong>Melody</strong> - âNo, it does not cause an abortionâ  "Plan B does not terminate an already implanted, fertilized egg"<br /><br />She then accuses the pro-life movement of spreading âfake fearâ, after which she says:<br /><br /><strong>Melody</strong> - âThis is not an abortifacient, this is birth controlâ<br /><br /><strong>Charmaine</strong> - "You are playing with the semantics of it."  and "This is why it shouldn't be over the counter, because she's not willing to tell the truth about it."<br /><br />The pro-abortion movement is good at the argument aren't they?<br /><br />They play word games & the public falls for it.  Plan B does not terminate an already implanted egg, as the representative from the National Organization for Women says.  What it does is prevent a fertilized egg from implanting.  Web sites around the world support the lies, but if you go to the FDA web site you will see the answer for yourself.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fda.gov/cder/drug/infopage/planB/planBQandA.htm">FDA Website article on Plan B</a><br /><br />âPlan B works like other birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Plan B acts primarily by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary (ovulation). It may prevent the union of sperm and egg (fertilization). If fertilization does occur, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb (implantation). If a fertilized egg is implanted prior to taking Plan B, Plan B will not work.â<br /><br />Letâs repeat the key line:<br /><br />âIf fertilization does occur, Plan B may prevent a fertilized egg from attaching to the wombâ<br /><br />Again, the pro-abortion movement is playing games with life & they believe that the American public is too stupid to recognize it.  Are we?<br /><br />Hillary Clinton is blackmailing President Bush and the country.  She said she will not vote for President Bush's FDA nominee unless Plan B is pushed onto the unsuspecting American public.  Also, pharmacists will be put on the spot when they challenge distribution of this drug on moral grounds.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.redorbit.com/news/health/166669/sale_of_plan_b_contraceptive_splits_new_york_pharmacists/">Article</a><br /><br />"Recently, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) cited the FDA's inaction in voting against nominating Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Lester Crawford as commissioner. Crawford's nomination is still in limbo."<br /><br />There is no debate on this topic.  There is no debate on the topic of abortion either.  We have to go back to sanity.  Plan B is not ethical.  It is playing Russian Roulette with human beings.  Even if the odds are 1 in 1000 that you will kill your child because of this pill, would you want to be the 1000th person buying it over the counter and killing your child, or possibly yourself?<br /><br />If we do nothing to stop the killing of defenseless children in America then we are just as guilty as those who are doing it.  We must unite so that our voices will be heard.  We have to let our representatives know that we want them to stop killing human beings.  They should defend life, not take it.  Look at all the forms of decriminalized murder in America:<br /><br />> Abortion - all the way up to the day of delivery<br />> Sex/gender selection<br />> Birth control pills<br />> In vitro fertilization<br />> Embryonic stem cell research<br /><br />Do you believe that abortion and human research are wrong?  Then join us and speak out against it.  Go to monthlycallforlife.com and unite with us this Friday and every first Friday of the month in our Call for Life.  We call and/or email our representatives to let them know that we don't support abortion nor research that kills human beings.<br /><br />It is time for action in America.  Over 3,000 human beings are killed every day by abortion in this country and we need to defend them.  Even if you are already involved in a pro-life effort, you can take the time to call and/or email your representative.<br /><br />Speak up this Friday, August the 4th.
