Today's  Washington Post <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/24/AR<br />2006082401631.html"><br />2006082401631.html"><br />2006082401631.html">reports</a> that Rep. Chris Shays now favors a timetable for troop withdrawal and feels that most of said withdrawal could take place within the next year.  The Lamont campaign pointed out that Rep. Shays position on Iraq was now in line with Lamont's own.  In a press release Lamont said: "I'm pleased that Congressman Shays now understands the importance of changing course and is talking about a timetable to withdraw our troops."<br /><br />In a conference call with the media Lamont Campaign Manager Tom Swan and Chairman of the Campaign George Jepson called on Senator Joe Lieberman to object to Rep. Shays calls for withdrawal with as much vigor as it has Lamont's similar views.  They want Lieberman to clarify his own position on Iraq as well as whether or not he agreed with Shays who has visited Iraq several times previously.<br /><br />When reached for comment Senator Lieberman offered that he would "take a look" at what Shays proposed.  <br /><br />In her own press release Rep. Shays opponent Diane Farrell questioned Shays's change of position saying, "ÂChris Shays has been to Iraq 14 times.  Thirteen times he came home saying things were great. Now all of a sudden he sees what I've been saying for years. I find that quite curious."<br /><br />I'll have more from the conference call up this evening, including details about this afternoon's meeting betwwen Lamont and Senator Hillary Clinton.<br /><br /><i>Edit 5:38PM: I inadvertantly misidentified George Jepson's title.
