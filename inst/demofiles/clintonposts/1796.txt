<a href="http://www.opinioneditorials.com/freedomwriters/balba_20060324.html">The 'Bible Literacy Project' - Not Attacked by the ACLU Yet!</a> goes on to say..<br />âCongress granted the approval to print âa neat edition of the Holy Scriptures for the use of schools.â Congressâ endorsement stamped on the first page: âWhereupon, Resolved, That the United States in Congress assembled...recommend this edition of the Bible to the inhabitants of the United States...â.<br />
<br />Okay, American Civil Liberties Union, People for the (anything but) American Way, and People United for Separation of Church and State --- donât get yourselves in an uproar! Itâs history. The above event happened twice --- 1777 and 1782 when Congress ordered 20,000 Bibles each time for the benefit of citizens and childrensâ education...<br />
<br />..Then there was no question about the Bible as education...The last 80 years, the ACLU and others have taken Americaâs Christian foundation to court --- and Won! through the idiocy of socialist-minded, self-serving Supreme Court judges...<br />
<br />Todayâs public schools, connected as they are to the purse strings of the secular federal government, have pushed God and His Word out of the schools thereby limiting childrensâ education. Children lack background reference to many phrases common in language such as âwalk on water,â âpearls before swine,â â30 pieces of silver,â âthe Golden Rule,â and âthe last shall be first.â How would a child or an adult know where these phrases originated or what they mean unless they have read the Bible?<br />
<br />Despite the attempt to twist the First Amendment to suit small-minded and self-serving interest groups, the people are responding through adopting Bible curriculum as an elective in high schools. One such group is the National Council on Bible Curriculum in Public Schools (NCBCPS). Their course called âThe Bible as History and Literatureâ is taught in 1,100 high schools in 346 school districts in 37 states, from Alaska and California to New Jersey and Florida. The Bible is the textbook. The ACLU does not endorse this curriculum but has not sued to date.<br />
<br />Imagine the Congress authorizing the printing of the Bible for public schools today. The enraged outcry from special interests, minority groups, and other secular, atheist factions would further extinguish the voices that speak to us through the Bible." <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Back in the day, a common question would be -  <strong>What does Bible say about..?</strong>It was God who set the moral standards for mankind. How does morality exist outside of the theological context?<br />
<strong>Look around you these days...it doesn't</strong>.<br />
<br />What you bear witness to is moral chaos reminiscent of ancient Israel before the time of its kings when "everyone did what was right in his own eyes" (Judges 21:25).To state that moral relativism and situational ethics work in the long run is a purely dishonest rationalization.<br />
<br />While it is certainly appealing to think that humans would discover "on their own"- that murder, lying, stealing, and pornogrpahy are harmful enough to the general welfare to be considered morally wrong...the evidence lies in the decadent Godless culture you see before you.<br /> <br /> <br />
<strong>When deciding issues of "right or wrong" it seems most find themselves hopelessly trapped in a maze of confusion with no clear direction.</strong>
<br />Homosexual marriage?<br />Polygamy?<br />Incest?<br />Bestiality?<br />
<br />Wer'e lost with respect to the most fundamental aspects of our lives: Our locus of control,what truly gives us  self-esteem,  our social values, and the status of the family. <br />
<br />Perhaps next time we are faced with a moral dilmemna, we would do wise to ask <strong>"What does Bible say about..?"</strong>
