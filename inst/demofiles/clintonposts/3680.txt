<div>To celebrate Paigeâs birthday, she had a slumber party with three of her friends.  To avoid the potential drama that almost always follows and eight year oldâs slumber part, I wanted to have quite the itinerary for those girls to avoid any questionable happenings.  I roped Sarah and Noelle into my evil scheme and planned the Extreme Makeover â Slumber Party Edition for that night.  I have to say (insert tooting my own horn here) that the party was a huge success.  Sarah did make-up (complete with beauty tips for each girl) while Noelle did nails (did you know that eight year old girls LOVE having their nails alternate colors?) and then I did hair.  And the whole reason that Iâm writing about this is to brag that one of the girls said, and I quote: <strong>
<em>âThis is THE BEST SLUMBER PARTY I HAVE EVER BEEN TO!â<br />
</em>
</strong>
<br />Yes, thatâs rightâ¦I, like, threw the best, like, slumber <strong>EVAR</strong>!  And dudes, we hadnât even started the karaoke yet!<br />
<br />KARAOKEâ¦probably the scariest and the most fun word there is.  And thatâs just the spelling of it.  (Thank Bob for spell check.)  I donât think I could even begin to describe the decibel of squeal once the K-word was spoken.  It was at that moment I knew that there would be a Hillary Duff or Cheetah Girls song stuck in my head for the next 3 daysâ¦because eight year old girls LOVE to do the same song over and over and over and over.  Itâs part of their charm.<br />
<br />But what really takes the cake (and boy can those midgets pound back the cake!) is when Paige pulls one of the magazines Iâm in from the counter to show her friends my ad.  (I keep all the âpublicationsâ handy just in case important company comes over.  You know, like the Popeâ¦Ralph Laurenâ¦or that kid who plays Urkel.)  She opens that magazine, points to my picture and tells her friends, âLOOK.  Itâs my MOM!  SHEâS FAMOUS!â<br />
<br />And, wellâ¦far be it for me to crush the hopes and dreams of the birthday girl so I decided to play along.  Of course, by playing along I mean that this âfamous momâ worked her âfamousâ self to the bone putting on The Best Slumber Party EVER complete with pizza, root beer and Funfetti cake and slept in the living room to make sure all was okay.  And by golly, itâs a good thing that nothing did happenâ¦âcause I just slept right on through it all.<br />
<br />But see, what really is starting to bug me about the whole thing is that since I am SUCH a famous mom then why am I sitting at my desk, staring out at the river with not ONE of those fantastic boats cruising area being mine??<br />
<br />They must not realize that it is ME on the back of that bus they are following.  Perhaps I should invite them to Paigeâs NEXT slumber party.  Sheâll set them straight.</div>
