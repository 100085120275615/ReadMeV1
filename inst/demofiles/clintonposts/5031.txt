<span>So the </span><a href="http://capwiz.com/congressorg/issues/votes/?votenum=29&chamber=S&amp;congress=1092" target="1"><span>USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reorganization Act</span></a> <span>passed recently 89 to 10 (with one Senator abstaining). </span><span>As could be predicted, New York's brave Dem Duo (Sens. Clinton and Schumer) voted with the sycophants of empire and helped secure the bill's passage.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Here's what Sen. Schumer <a href="http://www.lifeandliberty.gov/subs/support/senschumer102501_1.pdf">said</a> about the PATRIOT Act in late 2001, according to the October 25, 2001 edition of the <em>Congressional Record</em>:</span><br /><br /><span><blockquote><span>If there is one key word that underscores this bill, it is 'balance.' In the new post-September 11 society that we face, balance is going to be a key word. ... The balance between the need to update our laws given the new challenges and the need to maintain our basic freedoms which distinguish us from our enemies is real. ... This is the Senate working at its best under a crisis situation but still with care and a appropriate degree of deliberation.</span></blockquote></span><span>That was bullshit then, and remains rank today. Schumer's sad, rote speech from 2001 meant exactly the opposite of the literal definition of his words. By "balance," he meant "heavyhanded power grab." By "appropriate degree of deliberation" he meant "quick decision reached through blind faith."</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Back in December 2005, Schumer and Clinton were part of a major bloc of Senators who refused to reauthorize major portions of the PATRIOT Act, proclaiming these provision infringed too much on Americans' privacy, liberty, rights, souls. Yet, s</span><span>omewhere along the line, the DOJ and Attorney General's office got to the Democrats in Congress and made some behind-the-scenes "compromises." These compromises redefined the duration the federal agencies could obtain FISA surveillance orders of "non-United States persons," and made a few other amendments and alterations to the existing act.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>However, scanning the text and considering the old bill in its entirety, it seems to me that the Senate has hardly wrestled major concessions from the White House, let alone showed some balls vis-a-vis the rights of private citizens. I will grant that some of the language concerning libraries appears to be a step in the right direction, and working on FISA surveillance measures was at least an attempt to exert legislative control of the White House's unwieldly and secret plan. Nevertheless, Bush Co. hardly seems contained. In fact, in the end the Administration's power has been extended, and certain specific powers declared in the PATRIOT Act have been tweaked merely to fit the political situation at hand. I'm no legislative expert, but I'd like to hear from Sens. Schumer and Clinton how any of this works to protect Americans and their rights, and I mean sans platitudes and test-marketed newspeak.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>What's the lesson? </span><span><strong>Congress needs to re-establish itself as a counterweight to executive power!</strong></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>This bill is not evidence of Congress' reinvigorated sense of independence, but rather the latest in a series of abdications spun as good governance. While Senate Democrats and a few outre Republicans were able to nab some amendments, the PATRIOT Act's framework remains largely unchanged. We need the Senate and the House to do their job and act as a functional bulwark against the White House's seemingly limitless power. That does not seem likely in a crumbling republic.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>***</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Oh, check out <a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,18360632^2703,00.html">this article</a> from yesterday's <em>The Australian</em>, which outlines yet one more reason Cheney might be one of the worst pols in American history. Did you know Elizabeth Cheney, Dick's daughter, works at the State Department? Yeah? OK, but did you know her job is to promote democracy in <strong>Iran</strong> (AKA the Next Front, AKA Second Largest Oil Producer in the World)?</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>The Republican Party's foul sense of nepotism has seen fit to have Cheney <em>fil</em> oversee a project with a $85 million budget whose mission is to overthrow one of our most ardent and capable enemies. One misstep and we could be in a serious, nuclear snit along the Straits of Hormuz, and they have Dick Cheney's <em>fucking kid</em> hobnobbing with the Shah in order to "promote democracy?" Yet another illustration as to why we are, as a people, fucked.</span><br /><span><blockquote><span>In the State Department, [Elizabeth Cheney] is referred to as the "freedom agenda co-ordinator" and the "democracy tsar" for the Middle East. ... Her official title is deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, and she is in charge of spending $85 million--up from $10 million [in 2005]--recently allocated to promote democracy in Iran. Much of the money will be spent on broadcasting the views of exiles, dissidents and reformers inside Iran. ... 'She has a lot of experience dealing with non-governmental organisations and knows what she is talking about. She is a different person from her father.' </span></blockquote></span><span>Fuck that noise. All commetary attesting to Ms. Cheney's qualifications and smarts should be disregarded. She may have some expertise, but the eminence of her position is clearly owed to the station held by her father. Secretary of Defense, rich executive, Vice President, these are titles that open doors for your kids, kids who in another life would be nothing more than <a href="http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/delasoul/is_dead/bitties.dls.txt">Bitties in the BK Lounge</a>.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span><img alt="" src="http://www.fastfoodweblog.nl/www/images/pimpmyburger.jpg" border="0" /></span>
