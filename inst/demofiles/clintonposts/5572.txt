So much has been said about the Dubai ports deal that entices further analysis and debate. My contribution on the subject matter will be to analyze the article â<a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/011/903otiam.asp">Dumb and Dumberer</a>â from David P.Baronâs non-market environment perspective.<br /><br />According to Baron, the nonmarket environment of a firm or industry is characterized by four Iâs: issues, interest, institutions, and information. For Dubai Ports World, the four Iâs are quite obvious.<br /><br /><strong>Issues:</strong> The main issue with the Dubai ports deal is <em><strong>US national security</strong></em>. Democrats and Republicans have caused an uproar in Congress saying that the deal would make the country vulnerable to terrorist attacks. Another issue is <em><strong>foreign investment in the US market</strong></em>. As the article states:<br /><br /><div align="left"><em>If America puts down an unwelcome mat for Dubai, it will also be sending a signal to foreign investors in China, Russia, and the Middle East that hostility to foreign investment is so great that they might wish to dump their hoard of dollars onto the currency markets, rather than invest them in U.S. assets.<br /><br /></em>A third issue, which is of most importance yet seems to be of lesser concern among public debate, is the â<strong><em>geopolitical consequences</em></strong> of telling a friendly Arab state that it is unwelcome in America after a widely publicized brawl about its suitability to replace another foreign investor (Britain's P&O;) to which there were no objectionsâ.<br /><br /><strong>Interests:</strong> The people and groups who have an interest in the DPW deal are many. First, the <strong><em>Democrats and Republicans</em></strong> each have their own political agenda behind their opposition to the deal. According to the article, Senator Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, who are preparing for a presidential run in 2008, oppose the deal because âthis is the best chance they have had to appear tougher on terrorists and national security than the Republicans since the twin towers were brought downâ.<br /><br />Other main interest groups include the <em><strong>Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States</strong></em> (CFIUS), the <em><strong>U.S. Coast Guard</strong></em>, and the <em><strong>House Homeland Security Committee</strong></em>. The specific motives of these organized interests are vague and complex, therefore I will only say that their deep involvement with the issue stands as evidence to their high political and economic stakes in the deal.<br /><br />Another interest group (this time an unorganized interest) is <em><strong>foreign investors</strong></em>. The article says that foreign investment by companies owned by states hostile to the United States is a bad thing because such enterprises operate in the geopolitical interests of their countries, rather than solely in response to market forces.<br /><br /><strong>Institutions:</strong> The institutions which serve as the arenas in which the competing interests of this case contest are mainly the <em><strong>Congress</strong></em>, <em><strong>State legislatures</strong></em>, the <em><strong>Bush Administration</strong></em>, the <em><strong>news media</strong></em> and <em><strong>public sentiment</strong></em>. These institutions possess the political clout and lobbying power that will ultimately define the verdict of the controversy.<br /><br /><strong>Information:</strong> The different kinds of information about the Dubai ports deal available to all these interest groups and institutions plays a major role in defining their positions and preferences on the issue. Information about the UAEâs involvement in the 9/11 attacks serve as the main platform from which Republicans, Democrats, and the public derive their anti-deal arguments. The article says that:<br /><br /><em>Two of the attackers on the World Trade Centre were citizens of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), of which Dubai is a component state; Dubai is alleged to be home to some of the banks that laundered money for the attackers; and A.Q. Kahn's nuclear-smuggling network hid behind a Dubai front.</em><br /><br />More importantly, the constant media rhetoric on the dangers of terrorists, and the growing public concern about U.S. national security during the past 6 years, have led to fervent opposition from the public and have added to the urgency of the issue.<br /><br />As for those who support the deal, their arguments are based on the information provided by the early Coast Guard documents that concluded that the DP Worldâs acquisition of P&O; does not pose a significant threat to US security. Also supporting their pro-deal position is the fact that the protection of port terminal operations ultimately lies in the hands of the Coast Guard, the U.S. Customs and Homeland Security, so there is no real threat to U.S. national security.<br /><br /><strong>Conclusion</strong>: After briefly examining the 4 Iâs that shape the nonmarket environment of Dubai Port World, we can discuss their implications on the firmâs current and future performance. According to Baron, âeffective management in the market environment is a necessary condition for success, but it is not sufficient. The performance of a firm, and of its management, also depends on its activities in its nonmarket environmentâ. I believe that Dubai Port Worldâs cooperation with the U.S. government in allowing extensive investigations is an effective method in dealing with this particular non-market issue. The CEO, Mohammed Sharaf, tries to mitigate US concerns through prolonged talks and negotiations with US officials, and numerous <a href="http://www.cnn.com/video/player/player.html?url=/video/us/2006/03/05/intv.sharaf.blitzer.cnn&amp;wm=10">interviews</a> with the press and media. In acknowledging US concerns, he says âObviously the American people have an issue, we would like to know that, and rectify if there are any security measures that we need to take which we have not taken yet. And we are very confident that we have met and will meet all the requirementsâ.<br /><br />DP World is doing the best it can to resolve the nonmarket issues that interfere with their marketing strategies, but unfortunately, the fate of the acquisition deal is ultimately determined by those interest groups with the greatest political and lobbying power. This politically-controlled environment not only compromises DP Worldâs marketing strategies, but also has serious post-deal consequences for the firm. If the deal is barred, DP Worldâs legitimacy as a worldwide port operator will be undermined, to say the least. Uncertainties will arise among the firmâs existing contracts, and questions will be raised about the firmâs security credentials. On the other hand, if the deal is granted, DP World will be facing a new surge of criticism and attacks by angry Democrats and âanti-terroristâ activists. The company will have a hard time forgoing standard operations and procedures without facing obstacles of some kind. So we can see that for DP World, itâs almost a lose-lose situation. The problems of this issue will not go away until the United States recognizes that DP World is not a terrorist organization that wants to destroy and murder innocent Americans, but a legitimate and honest company that seeks to improve Arab-US relations and promote free trade. </div><div align="left"> </div><div align="left"><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/DP+world" rel="tag">DP world</a></div><div align="left"><a href="http://technorati.com/tag/David+Baron" rel="tag">David Baron</a></div>
