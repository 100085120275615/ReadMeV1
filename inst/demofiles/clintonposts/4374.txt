<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/08/25/D8JNM09G0.html">this article</a>, Hillary Clinton is stabbing Joe Lieberman in the front while trying to ingratiate herself to the Nutroots gang.</p>
<blockquote><p>Lieberman is running as an independent in November, and Republicans have attempted to cast his primary loss as a sign that the Democratic Party has been taken over by its extreme left wing.<br />
At Clinton&#8217;s Westchester County home, she and Lamont &#8220;talked about what Mr. Lamont can expect from the George Bush-Karl Rove attack machine,&#8221; Wolfson said. &#8220;She told him Republicans were invested in defeating him.&#8221; Clinton has contributed $5,000 from her political action committee to Lamont&#8217;s campaign and will do &#8220;whatever works for the campaign,&#8221; Wolfson said. Wolfson, one of Clinton&#8217;s senior political strategists, also said he will join the Lamont campaign as an adviser.</p></blockquote>
<p> Hillary knows that Lamont is a political idiot but she thinks he&#8217;s a good vehicle to &#8216;get herself right&#8217; with the Nutroots crowd. If Lamont had come along 25 years ago, he wouldn&#8217;t have gotten 10 percent of the vote. Because the Democratic Party is now dominated by the idiot anti-war faction, he won a primary. I&#8217;ve said before that JFK, FRD and Harry Truman wouldn&#8217;t recognize this Democratic Party, nor would they want anything to do with it.</p>
<p>The old party bosses would&#8217;ve pushed Lamont to the side in a heartbeat. Today&#8217;s &#8216;party bosses&#8217; are nothing more than megalomaniacs who crave power so badly that they can&#8217;t think straight. It&#8217;s a sad sight, especially when you see them kick one of the most decent men in American politics to the curb. Joe Lieberman deserved far better than he&#8217;s getting.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Hillary will do whatever is the politically expedient thing at the moment. That&#8217;s why people don&#8217;t trust her. That&#8217;s why she&#8217;ll never get elected President.</p>
