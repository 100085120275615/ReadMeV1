<div>I am disgusted with this Dubai deal getting queered by congress. Sure, Dubai pulled out of their own accord. But, what kind of message does this send to the rest of the world, the Arab world in particular, when we are preaching democracy to them, asking for cooperation in deterring terrorism, yet we are protectionist dinosaurs who don't want to do business with them? <br />
<br />Some of the Democrats would squander the opportunity to improve relations with the wider world in order to affect a political stance--one that, together with the others that they have adopted in their quest to oppose President Bush, they can't even believe in themselves!<br />
<br />I shudder to think of the consequences of the American resistance to the Dubai deal.<br />
<br />I tend to think that some of the Democrats' sudden reluctance to cooperate with Arabs is a hypocritical pose, while some of the Republican officials who reacted against the decision were grandstanding in a pose of more toughness against "terror", for whatever reasons. Meanwhile, some on both sides--especially the Republicans who just reacted without knowing the details and dynamics of the ports deal--are guilty of ignorance on the topic. Saying that someone is ignorant on a topic is not condemnation. No one is omniscient, and I confess that like most people I was ignorant on the ports proposal until I did some learning.<br />
<br />When we were greeted in the Fairmont (a nice hotel in Europe) last week by Bill Clinton's visage emblazoned upon the front page of the Financial Times, and an accompanying article about his consulting on behalf of Dubai in this proposal, we had a good time ridiculing President Clinton's friends Senator Pelosi, et alia, in their assumed stances against President Bush' decision.<br />
