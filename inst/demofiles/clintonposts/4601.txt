<p>In the ratings, that is.</p>

<p>Over at <a href="http://www.libertyfilmfestival.com/libertas/">LIBERTAS</a> (which, if you're a conservative with any interest at all in popular culture, you really need to be reading every day), <a href="http://www.libertyfilmfestival.com/libertas/index.php?p=1266">the lead story</a> concerns the huge ratings for the opening episodes of <em><a href="http://www.fox.com/24/">24</a></em>.  LIBERTAS links to <a href="http://www.darkhorizons.com/news06/060118d.php">this story</a> from <a href="http://www.darkhorizons.com/index.php">Dark Horizons</a>, which says:</p>

<blockquote>Jack Bauer's latest marathon workday got off to a good start Sunday, ratings-wise reports The Hollywood Reporter.

<p><strong>The Fox drama "24" notched its most-watched episode ever with its fifth-season premiere with the first of two back-to-back episodes. Airing from about 8:13-9:11 p.m. EST, the first episode of "24" averaged 17 million viewers and a 7.3 rating in the adults 18-49 demographic.</p>

<p>The second hour of "24," which ended at about 10:13 p.m. EST, held onto the majority of its lead-in to finish out with 15.5 million viewers and a 6.7 in adults 18-49.</strong></blockquote></p>

<p>Meanwhile, John Podhoretz at National Review Online's <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/">The Corner</a>, in a post titled <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_01_15_corner-archive.asp#087812"><em>Geena Davis, Going Back To Archery</em></a>, passes along the following excerpt from <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/television/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001882235">this story</a> in the <a href="http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/index.jsp">Hollywood Reporter</a>:</p>

<blockquote>"Commander in Chief" is losing its grip on power. The new ABC drama series, which earned star Geena Davis a Golden Globe Award this week for her role as the first female U.S. president, seems to be sinking into the same midterm malaise affecting the approval ratings of President Bush; "Commander's" ratings have been declining steadily since bowing to big numbers in September. ... Now the network and "Commander" producer Touchstone Television, ABC's fellow Walt Disney Co. subsidiary, are grappling with a dilemma that happens to be playing itself out in one of the series' own story lines: What will it take to get "Commander" re-elected for another term?</blockquote>

<p>JPod adds, "Gee, that's too bad."  (In <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_01_15_corner-archive.asp#087820">this later post</a>, Cornerite Jonah Goldberg notes, "I think everyone here in the Corner who participated in last Fall's prediction-of-doom-fest deserves a pat on the back.")</p>

<p>Could this divergence in the fortunes of the two shows be simply that one is better and more entertaining than the other?  Of course.  But the cultural / political implications are clear for anyone to see.  As can be seen from the links provided in my posts on <em>24</em> from earlier this week (see <a href="http://benedictblog.com/archives/2006/01/terrorists_shoo.php">here</a> and <a href="http://benedictblog.com/archives/2006/01/wwjbd_what_woul_1.php">here</a>), the exploits of Jack Bauer hold tremendous red-state appeal.  <em>Commander-in-Chief</em>, on the other hand, was widely seen as a paean to the policies and personal ambitions of Hillary Clinton, who weekly would use her superior intelligence, charm and understanding of human nature to foil the schemes of the evil, bigoted Republicans and bring light and truth to the world. /gag.</p>

<p>If you've been reading LIBERTAS, then you know that a continuing theme of that blog's reportage is the disconnect between the Hollywood honchos who decide what movies and television shows get made and the audiences who are increasingly opting not to watch that product.  It seems to me that today's stories can stand as Exhibit 234 in suppoort of that thesis.  To paraphrase James Earl Jones in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=benedict-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fproduct%2F078322611X%2Fqid%3D1137779589%2Fsr%3D1-1%2Fref%3Dpd_bbs_1%3F%255Fencoding%3DUTF8%26v%3Dglance%26n%3D130"><em>Field of Dreams</em></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=benedict-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" />, if you film it, they will come.  The "it" in this case is entertainment free of anti-American, anti-traditional family, anti-military, pro-homosexuality, pro- (or even neutral) substance abuse and promiscuity agendas, and the "they" are all those millions of people in flyover country.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  From the "great minds think alike" department, blogger Detroit Patriotette (watch that pronunication) at <a href="http://rightfromnewfalluja.blogspot.com/">Conservababes</a> has a post titled "<a href="http://rightfromnewfalluja.blogspot.com/2006/01/thoughts-on-television.html"><em>Thoughts on television</em></a>" which is must reading.  And <a href="http://www.libertyfilmfestival.com/libertas/index.php?p=1266#comment-109525">this link</a> from "jummy" in the comments to the story linked above at Libertas will ultimately lead you to an article at a lefty site titled - no kidding - "<em>The Depraved Heroes of 24 Are the Himmlers of Hollywood</em>".  You can't make this stuff up.</p>
