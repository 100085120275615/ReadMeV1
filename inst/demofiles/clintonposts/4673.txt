<p>Ned Lamont met with Hillary Clinton yesterday in New York. Over for coffee they discussed campaign strategy and Hillary&#8217;s offer to host a fundraiser for Lamont. Although Clinton has  received criticism from opponents of the Iraq war for her &#8220;refusal to recant her 2002 vote authorizing the Iraq conflict,&#8221; the move to step up support for Lamont should bode well not only for Lamont but with the anti-war contingent that Hillary will need to woo, should she decide on an &#8216;08 run. </p>
	<p>Spokesman for Hillary Clinton Howard Wolfson said, &#8220;It was a great meeting. Senator Clinton thinks Ned Lamont did a fabulous job in Connecticut.&#8221;  </p>
	<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/08/25/D8JNM09G0.html">At Clinton&#8217;s Westchester County home</a>, she and Lamont &#8220;talked about what Mr. Lamont can expect from the George Bush-Karl Rove attack machine,&#8221; Wolfson said. &#8220;She told him Republicans were invested in defeating him.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Clinton has contributed $5,000 from her political action committee to Lamont&#8217;s campaign and will do &#8220;whatever works for the campaign,&#8221; Wolfson said.</p></blockquote>
	<p>Wolfson, who one of Clinton&#8217;s senior political strategists, also announced on Friday that he will &#8220;<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/08/25/D8JNM09G0.html">join the Lamont campaign</a> as an adviser.&#8221; And, Lamont campaign manager Tom Swan said that &#8220;Lamont found Friday&#8217;s meeting beneficial.&#8221;
