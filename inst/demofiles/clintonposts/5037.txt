<span>Virginia Beach part one</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Part one âThe Driveâ<br /><br />The Wife and kids packed the Van the night before we left so all I had to do was wake up at 5:30 am, take a shower, wake the kids and wife from the Comaâs they call sleep and then drive for 12 hours on Saturday. Son #1 helped me drive some, so it wasnât that bad, but let me tell you my butt still hurts bad. Can I get a rub down here?<br /><br />The price of gas as is hovering around $3.00/Gallon so its 75 bucks for a fill up in the Queen Mary at every pit stop. That does not include all the other crap you have to buy while your at the gas station, so 85-90 bucks later, your on the road. Took me two and a half tanks going down and the same coming back. So I figured about 450.00 bucks in travel expenses. Could have been worse I guess?<br /><br />I had a strange thing happen while stopped in a little town called Breezewood, PA for gas. While I was pumping gas I watched a teenage girl of about 15, 16, 17?? years old bumming money from people going in and out of the station.. It looked liked she had been wearing the same clothes for the last two weeks and had been on the road for a while. Most people walking in to pay just pretended they didnât see her and walked right by her. Being the sucker that I am I stopped and asked her if she needed to use a phone to call someone. She said no, but she could use some money to eat with. I was kind of suspesious of that because she wouldnât let me call anyone for her and only wanted money. She wouldnât take a ride even though I told her my wife and kids were in the van and no I wasnât a psycho killer or anything. Dam, I felt like one just asking her that, but what do I know? She said she was fine and thanks anyway. At that point I was like well ok girl, looks like your doing what you want to do. I did give her 10 bucks for food and asked her if she was sure she couldnât call someone. No thanks. Having lived a fairly sheltered life, I guess I didnât know what else to do? I didnât want to call the cops because she didnât seem in any real danger? She wasnât hooking, she didnât seem to be a druggy. Iâm am sure she was a runaway and I guess she didnât want any help for some old fart like me. What would you guys have done? Yes I know she probably didnât buy food with the cash, but I guess I just felt for her situation. That and I hope that if either of my kids end up in a situation like that, some sucker would help them out the same way?<br /><br />Moving on, Driving through D.C. and the Virginia beach area has to be what its going to like in hell for Ted Kennedy and Bill & Hillary Clinton when they finally kick off. Washington D.C. has to have the worst traffic on earth bar none. The place goes from 3 lanes wide to like 6 lanes wide and yet traffic is still at a crawl? They have these HOV lanes. What a joke. The signs say 2 or more occupants to qualify. 50% of the cars only had one person in them? So why bother with the signs? No way in hell I could do that every day.</span><br /><span></span><br /><span>I did wave to Nikki on my way through Fredericksburg at 75 mph. It was raining like crazy at the time so I guess she didnt see me? I'm sure her house backs up to the Expressway so she can hear the trucks roar by at night. I do remember it was like 95 degree's at the time and as soon as the rain came it dropped like 10 degree's. Way to dam hot for me.<br /></span><br /><span>Virginia Beach has Tunnels that go under the water so the big navy ships can go in and out. Problem is if someone farts in the tunnel (see Christina), traffic comes to a dead stop. WTF is up with that. I stopped 3 MILES from the Hampton Roads tunnel for no apparent reason. 3 lanes of traffic and itâs at a dead stop? No accidents, no flat tires, nadda?Can you tell I hate traffic and all the idiot drivers out there? The locals all snuck by in the right lane until it got right to the tunnel and then squeezed in. By the time I realized what was going on, I was locked into left lane grid lock with no way out! <strong>Ahhhhhhhhhhh</strong> (me screaming)</span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span><br /><span></span>
