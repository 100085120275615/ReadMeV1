<div>Your host is busier than a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest today. Y'all talk amongst yourselves.<br />
<br />Some possible topics:<br />
<br />Sooners: Oklahomans should be embarrassed that so many are treating the Bomar scandal like it's the End of the World when every Baptist preacher in the state will tell you that the End of the World is starting in the Middle East -- not in Norman, Okla.<br />
<br />Mel Gibson: One thing the media doesn't understand about "The Passion" phenomenon is that it was the story of the Passion of Christ itself, not the movie, "The Passion of the Christ," that moved so many. I personally think it's wrong to accuse Gibson of being "pious." I personally think he is a particularly spiritual stripe of Catholic, with an inherited anti-semitic bent and a fetish for the gore, specifically the blood, associated with the Crucifixion. Most of Christianity emphasizes the Blood of Christ, mainly because of concepts of sin and sacrifice inherited from the Hebrew faith, the Paschal lamb and so on. Which makes Gibson's obsession with it kind of ironic. Fundamentalist Christians put Gibson on a pedestal, Gibson didn't; and fundamentalist Christians, who take the concept of "spiritual warfare" seriously, not secular, or Jewish, Hollywood, will take him down from it -- if he is taken down.<br />
<br />Israel-Hezbollah: Dr. ER and I are pissed that it's already become an also-ran story on the cable news! We were sickened to see the Mel Gibson story take over. Israel, sadly, seems to have followed the Rumsfield theory of war, which I heard on one of the shows: Send just enough troops to lose.<br />
<br />Hillary-Rumsfeld: Hillary finally grew the balls to say what needed to be said three years ago. Rumsfeld should go. His idea of a lean-mean fighting force was shortsighted when he came up with it and seems to be sheer insanity now -- read the Foreign Affairs article he wrote on it! I think it came out summer 2001, maybe fall. <br />
<br />That's enough.<br />
