<div>In an upcoming <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/08/24/60minutes/main1933092.shtml">60 Minutes interview</a> with Byron Pitts, New Orleans Mayor Schoolbus Nagin replied to a Pitts comment on flood-wrecked cars and home debris still unremoved with:<br />
<br />
<em>"Thatâs alright. You guys in New York canât get a hole in the ground fixed and itâs five years later. So letâs be fair."</em>
<br />
<br />This may reveal much of the Dem mindset. Ground Zero is just a hole in the ground and the Islamist war against the West is just a fabrication. Folks in glass houses...<br />
<br />Now if Newt Gingrich had referred to the Lower 9th Ward damage as "natural urban renewal", the MSM/Libs would be screaming for months. Chris Matthews would wonder if any hate speech charges could be filed against the former House Speaker. Hillary would weigh in on the comments with remarks suggesting the lack of response by Conservative charities. Charles Rangel would blame the un-removed debris on National Guard members being assigned to Iraq and Afghanistan.<br />
<br />Will any Dems tell Nagin to "sit down and shut up"? Will they try to justify his remarks, or just ignore them and hope the public forgets?<br />
<br />I don't mind pundits/comedians, etc., that dole out criticism and satire to both sides of the political aisle, when deserved, but those are the rare exceptions.<br />
<br />Maybe I am commenting too soon, maybe we need to wait for the public/media reaction. I just don't expect much.</div>
