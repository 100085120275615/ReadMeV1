Victor Davis Hanson has an excellent (as usual) article concerning the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/hanson/hanson200508260909.asp">strange alliances</a> being forged in the <strike>anti-war</strike> anti-America movement, of which Cindy "Mother" Sheehan is only the latest mouthpiece.  <br /><br /><blockquote>It is becoming nearly impossible to sort the extreme rhetoric of the antiwar Left from that of the fringe paleo-Right. Both see the Iraqi war through the same lenses: the American effort is bound to fail and is a deep reflection of American pathology. <br /><br />An anguished Cindy Sheehan calls Bush "the world's biggest terrorist." And she goes on to blame Israel for the death of her son ("Yes, he was killed for lies and for a PNAC Neo-Con agenda to benefit Israel. My son joined the Army to protect America, not Israel"). <br /><br />Her antiwar venom could easily come right out of the mouth of a more calculating David Duke. Perhaps that's why he lauded her anti-Semitism: "Courageously she has gone to Texas near the ranch of President Bush and braved the elements and a hostile Jewish supremacist media."<br /><br />This odd symbiosis began right after 9/11. Then the lunatic Left mused about the "pure chaos" of the falling "two huge buck teeth" twin towers, lamented that they were more full of Democrats than Republicans, and saw the strike as righteous payback from third-world victims. <br /><br />The mirror-imaging fundamentalists and censors in turn saw the attack as an angry God's retribution either for an array of our mortal sins or America's tilting toward Israel.<br /><br />In Iraq, the Left thinks we are unfairly destroying others; the ultra-Right that we are being destroyed ourselves. The former alleges that we are bullying in our global influence, the latter that we are collapsing from our decadence. <br /><br />But both, in their exasperation at George Bush's insistence on seeing Iraq emerge from the Hussein nightmare years with some sort of constitutional government, have embraced the paranoid style of personal invective. <br /><br />They employ half-truths and spin conspiracy theories to argue that the war was unjust, impossible to win, and hatched through the result of a brainwashing of a devious few neocons.</blockquote><br /><br />Read the rest, it's a much needed wake-up call.<br /><br />There is a strange mix a-brewin' in America.  The far Left and the Neo-Isolationist Right are combining to form a noxious brew.  We saw the warning signs even before 9-11, when Pat Buchanan and Lenora Fulani working together hijacked the last remnants of the old United We Stand Party and turned it into a mangled mix of paleo-con anti-Semitism and hard-left sandal-thumping.  But after 9-11, and certainly after the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq began, the trickle became a flood.  <br /><br />Hanson is absolutely correct in noting this convergence of anarchists, hard-left "peace" activists, hard-right racist and anti-Semite elements, and paleo-"libertarians" of the LewRockwell.com stripe.  The anti-war protestors such as Cindy Sheehan and her merry band down at Camp Cindy <a href="http://ijpublicpolicy.blogspot.com#notes"><sup>1</sup></a> have gained the "moral support" of <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=19186">David Duke</a>, <a href="http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_2726434.shtml">Stormfront</a>, <a href="http://www.wnbc.com/news/4899709/detail.html">Al Sharpton</a>, and <a href="http://www.kansascity.com/mld/kansascity/news/local/12400129.htm">"Rev." Fred Phelps</a>.  What sordid company: An ex-Grand Dragon of the KKK, a white supremacist racist group hoping for a coming race war, a charlatan "civil rights" leader responsible for the deaths of Jewish store owners and the defamation of police officers, and the leader of a one-family false church who thinks American soldiers are dying in Iraq because we don't stone gays to death.<br /><br />Why would such a strange assortment come together?  Sure it can't <i>just</i> be about the war in Iraq, can it?<br /><br />I think it goes deeper than that, and that the war is just a convenient coverall for what's really eating these people.  Besides being crazier than howler monkeys on crack cocaine, what do all of these "anti-war" activists seem to have in common?  The answer is they are all, in some form or fashion, marginalised from the general run of the body politic by their fringe political beliefs.  <br /><br />Let's face it, though some Americans are more or less against the war (often depending on whether they percieve us to be winning or losing), the really vocal left-wing activists do NOT represent your average suburban soft-liberal who is perhaps somewhat dovish.  Michael Moore does not represent them.  Neither does Howard Dean, or Code Pink, or MoveOn.Org, or Democratic Underground.  Though it seems like the nut fringe has well-nigh taken over the Democrat Party, the general run of Democratic politicians, at least at the national level, are scrambling to distance themselves from their own party chairman.  Whether its Joe Biden or Joe Lieberman who support our presence in Iraq, or Hillary Clinton who is pretending to so as to seem moderate, the bulk of major elected officials in the Party are not in-step with the radical activists, and neither are the majority of regular liberals in the United States.<br /><br />And of course, fringe disaffection comes from the other end too.  Despite the hyperbole from the hate America crowd, racism is NOT endemic in American society.  As such, the KKK and Stormfront and other racist groups don't have much of a market for their wares.  Likewise, most Americans can recognise that the real hard-core paleo-libertarian types are out-of-step with traditional American values.  These groups are also on a fringe of our political system.<br /><br />And what we're seeing are the fringes starting to work together.  But it's not <i>within</i> the system, to effect democratic change.  Rather, they are hoping to use a combination of one-sided media coverage, abusive and intimidating rhetoric, and attempts at silencing their critics to bring about a very <b>un</b>democratic change to the American political scene.  In short, these anti-war groups are not only threatening the freedom and democracy of the people of Iraq whom they would have us abandon, but they are also short-circuiting our OWN freedom and democracy.<br /><br />Now, the anti-war crowd is always very quick to remind us that they have the right to say what they want.  I don't disagree.  The Constitution guarantees every American the inalienable right to be a fool.  But please, let us dispense with the fantasy that the sort of "dissent" that we're seeing from the anti-war crowd is either patriotic or democratic.  Merely exercising a liberty inherent in a democratic system does not guarantee that you, yourself, are acting democratically.  In fact, it can often be simply the abuse of that liberty.  And abuse of our liberty is what we're seeing, and I have five reasons below for saying so: <br /><br />Reason #1 - The one-sided coverage of the war in Iraq that we are receiving from the media serves to distort the image that the people receive about the war, and presents the anti-war viewpoint both monolithically and dishonestly.  The picture painted by ABCNNBCBS and by other mass media outlets is <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2005/08/26/D8C7RDP00.html">quite different</a> from that told by actual soldiers who have been in Iraq.  The soldiers are routinely complaining about the dishonest reporting, the one-sided presentation of facts, the negative focus, and the apparent sympathy of the media for the terrorists.  We never hear about the vital infrastructure that has been rebuilt or about how the Iraqi people, by and large, really do like and want us there.  This media distortion, which only serves to encourage the terrorists and provide talking points to the anti-war crowd, is as undemocratic as outright vote fraud (which the Left is also known for).  It is used to frighten and mislead the American people into positions which they might not otherwise hold if they had the full facts about the war.  Just as voter intimidation and misleading electioneering are rightly viewed as inimical to our democratic processed, so also should one-sided and false presentation of the situation in Iraq, since this indirectly helps to determine what our policy there will be.<br /><br />Reason #2 - Relatedly, the bases upon which the arguments for the anti-war crowd rest are dishonest, and hence are used to subvert the ability of the people to make an informed choice as well.  From Cindy Sheehan making the nonsensical claim that we are using nuclear weapons in Iraq, to the claims by Joe Wilson that Saddam Hussein was not trying to purchase uranium in Niger (which has been shown to be false), the anti-war arguments are largely founded on disingenuity.  They have used doctored statistical arguments and padded figures to try to "prove" that insanely large numbers of Iraqi civilians have been killed by the American presence in Iraq.  They have relied upon obviously ludicrous hyperboles to mislead the American people - Abu Ghraib is back in business "under new management", setting the air conditioning on high in Gitmo is the equivalent to working someone to death in a copper mine in the Gulags, etc. etc.  <br /><br />They have repeatedly launched the accusation that President Bush "lied" about WMDs in Iraq - this despite the fact that EVERYBODY thought Saddam had them before the war, the UN, the Europeans, Democratic Senators, everybody.  Incidentally, the anti-war accusation reminds me of something I read once, about how very small children cannot distinguish between a mistake and a deliberate lie.  If a child is told something by an adult in error, and the error becomes know, the child assumes a lie was told and cannot understand that a simple error was committed.  Only when children grow older can they distinguish a lie from a mistake.  Apparently, many in the anti-war movement haven't reached this level of discernment yet. <br /><br />In all this, the apparent goal is to, again, deny the American people the full story, and present a one-sided image which amounts to little more than propaganda.  And again, the news media are largely complicit in this.  The American people are shown one side of the argument, and that a side largely designed to appeal to base emotion.  Nonstop coverage is given to a single war-mother who lost her son and now has been manipulated into being a tool of the anti-war establishment.  No coverage is given to the many thousands of war-parents who fully support the war and the President, and who want Cindy Sheehan to stop defaming the reputations and memories of their sons and daughters, both living and dead.<br /><br />Reason #3 - The unwillingness of the anti-war crowd to rationally discuss the issues, and their attempts to silence critics, is undemocratic and seeks to deny the freedom of speech to others that they would claim for themselves.  Instead of sitting down and rationally discussing the issues concerning our involvement in Iraq, the anti-war crowd seeks to draw on emotion and fear and sympathy.  You can't question Cindy Sheehan, because she's a grieving mother who lost her son in Iraq.  Nevermind that her plight in no wise actually addresses the issues themselves or in any way helps to determine the rightness or wrongness of the war.  Nevermind that she is a demonstrable liar who has changed her story, and destroyed the rest of her family by her pursuit of a political position that the rest of her family knows is idiotic.  But, the emotional argument is used to pillory and silence those who would question Sheehan's fitness to speak for ANYONE besides herself.  For instance, see Butler Shaffer's <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/shaffer/shaffer116.html">typical response</a> given at LewRockwell.com, in which he accuses conservatives of "waging a war" on Cindy Sheehan because they had the temerity to question her.  Emotionalism is detrimental to true freedom because it allows demagogues to override sound judgment and induce people to positions and actions which they would most likely otherwise not entertain had they been free to think and consider instead of react and empathise.   <br /><br />We all know, additionally, of the many overt means by which the anti-war crowd silences dissent.  One only has to see them in action.  If <a href="http://www.protestwarrior.com/videos/entering_zion.php">these videos</a> are any indication, the anti-war fringe thinks it has the sole right to public protest and assembly, if the violence that pro-American counter-demonstrators are met with is any indication.  From <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/23/AR2005082301583.html">defacing the private property</a> of people with "pro-war" bumper stickers to <a href="http://www.mensnewsdaily.com/archive/s/salvato/2005/salvato082605.htm">spewing hate-filled slogans</a> at wounded Iraq war veterans, the anti-war activists have been doing everything in their power to make sure that those who are on the wrong side of the war issue are "punished".  Such behaviour, obviously, has a negative effect on the willingness of average Americans who support the war to voice their opinions, which means that their liberties are infringed by the anti-war protestors.<br /><br />Reason #4 - Further, we are known by the company we keep, and "evil communication corrupteth good manners".  If the anti-war movement of all political stripes shows a propensity for siding with Islamofascist head-choppers over the soldiers and civilians trying to being freedom to 25 million fellow human beings, chances are it is because they have more in common with the former than the latter.  And this is arguably the case.  The Islamofascists and dictators hate America, they hate our system of government, they hate our freedoms and our prosperity.  Likewise, the leftward side of the anti-war movement feels much the same.  To them, democracy is a means to gain political mastery, not an end unto itself.  This is why they will screech and moan about how Bush "stole" the elections he won (despite the fact that every non-partisan inquiry made to date shows this allegation to be completely false), but they will blindly accept the results of the Venezuelan election through which Hugo Chavez maintained power, despite the widespread evidence of corruption and intimidation all across the country.  In the former, it was a relatively pro-capitalist conservative who won, in the latter, a socialist demagogue.  Likewise, they hate our economic system, just as do the radical Islamists.  They would destroy our capitalistic system and replace it with a radical sort of socialism, something not wholly foreign to the radical Islamist system either, which also hates our "decadent" wealth and prosperity.<br /><br />And the rightward side of the anti-war movement shares a common anti-Semitism, a likeminded Jew-hatred, with the Islamists.  Both groups, whether Jordanian al-Qaeda member or media-polished crypto-Klansman, believe the United States is controlled by Israel, dominated by a tiny cabal of Jewish bankers or industrialists or politicos.  They both have taken to confounding terms like "Zionist" and "Neo-Con" together, and both essentially are used to mean "dirty Jew".  Even Osama bin Laden's video campaign spot for John Kerry on the eve of the election last November contained language about the Neo-Cons and criticisms of American foreign policy not dissimilar to what one might read on LewRockwell.com or hear from Justin Raimondo.  <br /><br />Both sides of the spectrum in the anti-war movement are united by two things, a hatred for Israel, and a nagging feeling that the United States deserves what it gets and should get more of the same.  Both sides have a deliberate aim of undermining the morale of the troops and the war effort at home.  It is a misuse of liberty to use it to SUBVERT that liberty, which is essentially what they do when they make common cause with terrorists who would love nothing more than to drive the US out of Iraq, establish shari'a there, and then move on and do the same thing here.  <br /><br />Reason #5 - The underlying political philosophies which the conglomeration of anti-war activists espouse are against the free exercise of liberty, which results in their adherents being less than supportive of efforts to spread democracy abroad.  The socialism espoused by many on the anti-war left is openly statist, and has everywhere and always resulted in the curtailment of individual liberties and the vast expansion of direct government power in the lives of the citizens.  The racialism found among many on the extreme right of the war movement is obviously inimical to the exercise of many basic freedoms by many groups.  Even the extreme form of libertarian espoused by many in the "paleo-libertarian" movement, if considered and taken to its logical conclusions, would result in an environment detrimental to the free exercise of inherent liberties by many in such a society as they envision.  <br /><br />Many on the extreme left think that the traditional freedoms enjoyed by the American people are part of the problem (and they do, just ask Howard Zinn or Noam Chomsky how constitutional liberties and economic freedom affect such "rights" as free health care or free housing).  Many on the extreme right think the traditional freedoms enjoyed by our people are just impediments to their racial agenda.  Many on the libertarian fringe think that appeal to the defence of our traditional liberties from Islamism is just a smokescreen for perpetuating the "eternal war state".  Despite the disparity in motivation, the outcome remains generally the same - the defence of our liberty is hampered, and that liberty itself imperiled.  <br /><br />When these reasons are occluded together, we find a movement made up largely of political outsiders who, rather than seeking to work within the system, instead try to utilise deceit, propaganda, and fear to engender a turn towards their positions which reasoned debate on the issues of the war would not bring about.  In essence, they are trying to manipulate the American people, and are abusing the liberties afforded by our constitutional system in the process.  The undemocracy of their efforts is not due to the fact <i>that</i> they oppose the war.  Many good, thoughtful, patriotic people oppose the war for a number of sound reasons.  Rather, it is is due to the <i>means</i> by which the opposition is made - through the lies, the emotional manipulation, the fear-mongering, and the quasi-sedition of anti-war activists who can't accept that their position and candidate were rejected by a majority of the voters last November, and who are now trying to use fear and sedition to undermine the course of action which the NATION (not the President) approved in that election.  <br /><br /><a name="#notes">1</a> - I have chosen to call it "Camp Cindy", rather than "Camp Casey", because it is obvious that the focus is on Cindy Sheehan and her political circus, not on any real reverance for the memory of her son.
