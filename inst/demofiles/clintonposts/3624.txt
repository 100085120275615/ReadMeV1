<div>The lefties seem to love apologies these days. It used to be that they'd apologize for anything <em>they</em> did wrong and think it fixed everything (at least amongst themselves). Bill Clinton waived the "Lo Siento Wand" to get himself out of several tight spots and they simply loved when Richard Clark apologized for 9/11. Since then it's even more fashionable and they've expanded their repertoire to begin demanding apologies for everything that rubs them the wrong way or hurts their feelings even slightly, no matter how unsubstantiated the alleged offense or how irrational or illogical the political incorrectness charge <em>du jour</em> may be. In this spirit, I offer the following formal apology on behalf of all Californians:
<br />
<br />
<span>I apologize for Barabara Boxer.</span>
<br />
<br />The junior Senator rode Diane Feinstein's coattails into office eons ago and there is simply no excuse why we have left her there. I guess we just sort of forgot about her since she hasn't done anything newsworthy in a decade. And then came the Condolezza Rice hearing. <em>Res ipsa loquitur. </em>I'm truly sorry to Ms. Rice in particlar and America in general for that tantrum last week.
<br />
<br />By way of excuse, I can only offer this: neither Ms. Boxer nor her philosophical and intellectual twin Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi even like flying over the Orange Curtain let alone breaching its walls. Both of them are from the Bay area.
