Never has that been proved more true than the highly partisan and perhaps treasonous memo prepared for the Democrats on the Intelligence Committee.<br /><br />"Of all the committees, this is the one single committee that should unquestionably be above partisan politics. The information it deals with should never, never be distorted, compromised or politicized in any shape, form or fashion. For it involves the lives of our soldiers and our citizens. Its actions should always be above reproach; its words never politicized.<br /><br />"If what has happened here is not treason, it is its first cousin. The ones responsible - be they staff or elected or both should be dealt with quickly and severely sending a lesson to all that this kind of action will not be tolerated, ignored or excused.<br /><br />"Heads should roll!"</font></blockquote><br /><br />Let's see, Zell Miller has already endorsed President Bush's re-election.  Said he would actively campaign for the president, if he is asked to do so.  Writes a book entitled, "A National Party No Longer:  The Conscience of a Conservative Democrat".  And now he releases a statement excoriating Democrats on the Senate Intelligence committee.  Zell principles goes a long way in my book, for that has to be the only reason you remain a Democrat, but sheesh your principles have no place in the party of Clinton.  It's time for you to come join the light side.  Become a Republican, Zell, you'll thank yourself in the morning.  You cannot change the Democrat Party, no matter how hard you try.  That is currently impossible to do.  Until the Democrat Party rids itself of the radical environmentalists, the abortion on demand crowd, the race hustlers like $harpton and Jack$on, and the kind of elements you describe above, the party of Kennedy and Truman will never change.  You've earned the right to spend your last year in public life not pissing up a rope.<br />
