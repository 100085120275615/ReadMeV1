After much speculation about the purpose and motivation for Dick Cheney&#8217;s trip to Iraq this weekend (grandstanding, curiosity, responding to Hillary&#8217;s order), the true motive has been disclosed:<br />
<strong><br />
The Opening of the Iraq Duck Hunting Season</strong></p>
<p>Who would have known that the Iraqis would start the Duck Hunting season on the same week as they&#8217;d vote?  Bold move.</p>
<p>Dick Cheney invited Supreme Court Nominee Sam Alito to join him and was disappointed to learn that Sam was already hunting this weekend with Antonin Scalia in Louisiana.  Who&#8217;d have known that the 9th ward of New Orleans would be so full of great duck hunting blinds?</p>
<p>Cheney invited his personal Supreme Court Nominee choice, Wayne LaPierre (see photo), and some undisclosed fella to be his hunting partners for the weekend.</p>
<p>Good Luck Dick and Wayne!
