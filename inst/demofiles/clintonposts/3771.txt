<div>Yes, I know I've been gone a while.  I've got excuses aplenty.  And yes, I know I've strayed from the hard-hitting political commentary you've gotten used to.  For that, I say this: I'm just a little tired of it all.  I've come to realize that after following national politics for a while, you start to be able to predict everything that's going to happen.  Hillary Clinton is in favor of immigration reform.  Please, tell me something I don't know.  (If 80% of Americans want it, then it's a lock Hillary is for it, at least on the outside.)  A politician is caught taking hundreds of thousands in bribes.  Well, duh.  Can anyone say "term limits?"  Thirty years of being in Congress makes you two things: arrogant and powerful, and that is a deadly combination.  Just look at Ted Kennedy.  John Kerry is both for and against a wall along the Mexican border.  Shocking.<br />
<br />So anyway, I've not stopped following politics altogether, but I've backed away from it for a short break.  Hopefully my 4 readers will hang around anyway.<br />
<br />It was a long week last week.  I went down to Lake Park and spent four days and three nights with my buddy and his family for two purposes: to learn the produce business and to have a little fun.  Both missions accomplished, although I sure was hoping to play that golf course down there.  Turns out my buddy really does work for a living.  We went in at 8 in the morning, and every night it was past 6:30 before we left.  I learned a lot.  For instance, I learned that there are about 97 varieties of squash and about 74 varieties of peppers, and every variety has a different price that you have to have memorized.  A challenge, but interesting nonetheless.  I also learned a little of the produce business lingo.  There are the "pin hookers," who are guys that buy a field from a farmer for a fixed price and pick the vegetables, hoping to sell them for a profit.  Then there are the "birddogs" who scout out all the packing sheds to see which ones have the best product, and then report back to their employers, who then purchase said product.  I learned that those in the business use cute little abbreviations for common vegetables.  It's too much work to say "cucumbers," so they say "cukes" instead.  Same for "zucchini."  Those are "zukes."  Also, it turns out that the squash we eat down here in the south isn't common all over.  Our squash has a curved neck, so they call that a "crookneck."  Apparently those up north eat "straightneck" squash.  Who knew?  There is all kinds of cool stuff to learn.<br />
<br />Still, the most enlightening thing of the week was about my buddy himself.  Well, about the both of us, I guess.  We don't see each other that much these days.  He took off to the south down to Lake Park, and I took off to the north up to Warner Robins, but it's amazing how close you can stay when you've got a history together.  As Forrest Gump would say, "we was like peas and carrots."  <br />
<br />Or maybe I should use the illustration my dad prefers these days: we were like two peas in a pod, and neither of us has been fertilized.<br />
<br />Yeah, that's about right.</div>
