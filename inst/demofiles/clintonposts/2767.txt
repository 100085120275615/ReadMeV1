<div><p>Names matter.&nbsp; Ask anyone named Hieronymous, or a taxpayer in a jurisdiction that indebted itself for hundreds of millions to build a stadium, then sold the naming rights for a fraction of that to some self-serving corporation.&nbsp; Annoying and expensive mistakes. But when it comes to diplomacy, war, and peace, the wrong names can cost lives and alter the course of history. </p>

<p>It suits the agenda of the radical left to give misleading names to multitudes of things about terrorism.&nbsp; For example, constant repetition mutated &quot;monitoring of known terrorist bank accounts and phone numbers overseas&quot; into &quot;domestic surveillance&quot;.&nbsp; The latter sounds creepy and Nixonian, a subtle but serious infringement on our constitutional rights.&nbsp; In reality the program is used against non-citizens and out of the country, and thus by definition it is not domestic and has nothing to do with our Constitution or civil rights . </p>

<p>But the ACLU can't scare people and raise money by telling the truth in plain language.&nbsp; Democratic candidates can't whip up the faithful by being realistic about the costs and benefits of international spying on terrorists.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Even worse, a fair description of this program wouldn't make George Bush look bad.&nbsp; In fact, it would make him look like he was trying to &quot;connect the dots&quot;, something every good liberal has said the government should do. </p>

<p>So it goes with the issue of &quot;profiling.&quot; <a href="http://americandigest.org/mt-archives/003442.php">Liberalosis</a> causes people to think profiling is a sin.&nbsp; Ordinary people call profiling common sense.&nbsp; There have been several incidents recently where these ordinary people picked out fellow airline passengers who clearly needed more scrutiny.&nbsp; Of course the liberal media is just scandalized, shocked and appalled.&nbsp; Based only on the facts that someone carried suspicious items, behaved strangely and belonged to the demographic group from which 99.99% of terrorists come, these citizens were alarmed and took action.&nbsp; </p>

<p>It's almost like ordinary people want to go on living their own boring lives, instead of crusading against profiling or offering themselves as sacrifices to diversity by dying for the glory of Allah.</p>

<p>The New York Times, ever anxious to help, is considering several new features.&nbsp; &nbsp;Pinch Sulzberger is especially concerned: &quot;It's a complete waste of time for people to be looking around, on the alert for trouble, committing profiling in their hearts, when they could be reading our propaganda about the evils of George Bush.&quot;</p>

<p>Parents everywhere are quite familiar with the concept of profiling, or as Dad put it, &quot;don't hang around with losers.&quot;&nbsp; No sane person would allow their child to make friends with a bunch of fanatic death-cult suicide worshipers who might be carrying concealed weapons.&nbsp; But try to keep your child out of a classroom, bus or medical clinic with these bio-hazards, and liberals will call you a Nazi.</p>

<p>Weasel words in the newspapers don't change the way ordinary people see things.&nbsp; When you worry about your husband's plane being hijacked and flown into a building, knowing that screeners will do a politically correct search of someone's Aunt Tilly doesn't ease your mind.&nbsp; When your child isn't allowed to say a Christian prayer before he eats his school lunch, but your tax dollars are paying for him to study Muslim prayers, you feel betrayed, not diversified, no matter how Katie Couric may lecture you about it.</p>

<p>While we allow radical leftists and their dupes to play games with our language, Jihadists are arming themselves and planning the next attacks.&nbsp; We can cut the crap now and get serious before the grief of a huge loss makes us insane and vicious.&nbsp; Or we can let the games go on until the rules get changed for us.&nbsp; If an American city goes up in a nuclear blast, do you think anyone will care about the &quot;civil rights&quot; of those suspected of pushing the button?&nbsp; &nbsp;If 100,000 Americans die from poisoned municipal water, will a distaste for &quot;profiling&quot; stop the authorities from rounding up and pummeling the truth out of every Islamist male they can find?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Names matter; teminology matters.&nbsp; <u>I say we do whatever we have to do to stop these animals before they murder our children.</u>&nbsp; I think that's clear and I mean exactly what I'm saying.&nbsp; I hear plenty of other ordinary Americans say the same plain words.</p>

<p>Hillary, Katie, what do you say?</p>
