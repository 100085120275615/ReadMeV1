<p>They can't be happy about <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060807/ap_on_el_se/clinton_poll_1">this</a> over in Hillaryland..</p>

<blockquote>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton is maintaining big leads over potential Republican re-election opponents but would not fare as well among New York voters if she were to face former New York City        Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in a 2008 presidential race, pollsters reported Monday. 

<p>The poll, by Siena College's Research Institute, found the Republican Giuliani leading the former first lady 48 percent to 42 percent among registered voters asked about a hypothetical 2008 presidential matchup. The poll has a sampling error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</p>

<p>In another possible 2008 matchup, Republican Sen. John McCain (news, bio, voting record) of Arizona was favored by 46 percent of New York voters, compared to 42 percent for Democrat Clinton.</p>

<p>Other recent New York polls have found similar results.</p>

<p>The relatively strong showing by Giuliani and McCain against Clinton "will certainly put pressure on New York's junior senator to try and run up a big victory in her re-election battle this fall," said Steven Greenberg, a spokesman for Siena's polling operation.</p>

<p>The poll found 57 percent of New York voters saying they would vote in November to re-elect Clinton to the Senate and 38 percent saying they would prefer someone else, unchanged from a June poll by the Albany-area research institute.</blockquote></p>

<p>How well does that speak of you when you can't even win your own state(versus Mccain)? Well, I guess you could ask Al Gore that one. Of course Gore could afford to lose Tennesee, but no Democrat can afford to lose New York. Lose New York, and it's all over. This ought to get those on the left raising the topic of Hillary not being able to win in 08. Oh what fun...</p>
