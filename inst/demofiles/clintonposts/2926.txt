<br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br />
<br />IN RESPONSE TO FREE-SPEECH OUTRAGE, NY1 CANCELS SENATE DEBATE.<br />
<br />NEW YORK, NY â Local television station NY1 has quietly cancelled its scheduled August 22nd Town Hall meeting for the U.S. Senate race. Senate candidate Jonathan Tasini condemned the cancellation.NY1 had previously refused to invite Tasini to the event because, although he had met the ballot certification and polling requirements, he had not passed the arbitrary financial barrier set by NY1 of $500,000 either raised or spent on the campaign.<br />
<br />âNY1 is continuing to undermine democracy and fair political discourse,â said Tasini. âRather than rescind its undemocratic and anti-free speech position, the station is closing off debate.âNY1 received a flood of emails and calls from Tasini supporters as well as free-speech advocates from across the country criticizing the stationâs refusal to let Tasini participate in the Town Hall meeting.<br />
<br />Media watch-dog group FAIR, the Nation Magazine, and Democracy Now! have all sent out action-alerts to their email lists concerning the NY1 arbitrary financial barrier. âIn one sense, the stationâs action is a direct result of the outpouring of grassroots outrage to the stationâs suppression of political debate. NY1 feared the power of the grassroots,â said Tasini.<br />
<br />Pace University, which had agreed to host event, listed it as cancelled on its website yesterday, and sent out an email to people who had registered to attend saying that the event has been cancelled due to a conflict in participantsâ schedules. The notice also said that there are no plans to re-schedule the event - full text of notice copied below.<br />
<br />Senator Clintonâs office has yet to accept the invitation to participate in the League of Women Voters debate on September 6th, nor have they agreed to any other debates with Tasini.<br />
