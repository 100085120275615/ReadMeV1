Bush and Rummy continue to sound more and more like a stuck record. <a href="http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&fn=/2006/08/03/448293.html&amp;cvqh=itn_clinton"> During a Senate public hearing today, Senator Hilary Clinton</a> reminded Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld that this, "is not 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, when you appeared before this committee and made many comments and presented many assurances that have frankly proven to be unfulfilled."  Clinton also called for Rumsfeld's resignation.  I too am tired of the same old song and dance.  Bush and Rummy say the same things at every public occasion.  Perhaps they think if something is said enough times, everyone will believe it.  Problem for Bush and Rummy is more people are not buying the BS any longer.  Clinton has not until now joined the number of Democrats calling for Rumsfeld's resignation, but she too is now not believing the nonsense.
