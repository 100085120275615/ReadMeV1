</a> Howard Dean was ready when Wolf Blitzer came at him with the âeverybody does itâ angle on the Abramoff scandal:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>
<em>DEAN: There are no Democrats who took money from Jack Abramoff, not one, not one single Democrat. Every person named in this scandal is a Republican. Every person under investigation is a Republican. Every person indicted is a Republican. This is a Republican finance scandal. There is no evidence that Jack Abramoff ever gave any Democrat any money. And we've looked through all of those FEC reports to make sure that's true. </em>
</p>
<p>
<em>BLITZER: But through various Abramoff-related organizations and outfits, a bunch of Democrats did take money that presumably originated with Jack Abramoff.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>DEAN: That's not true either. There's no evidence for that either. There is no evidence...</em>
</p>
</blockquote>First, Dean is right that no contributions directly from Jack Abramoff went to any Dems. <a href="http://www.capitaleye.org/abramoff_donor.asp?Name=Abramoff%2C+Jack+A+%26+Pamela">
<strong>Opensecrets.org</strong>
</a> reports that all contributions from Jack and Pamela Abramoff since 1999 have gone to Republicans.<br />
<br />However, Abramoff was a principal in SunCruz Casinos when it gave a $3500 contribution to Rep. Peter Deutsch (D â FL) in 2002. Surely Abramoff had influence in directing the political contributions from SunCruz, and it is hard to make the case that it was not from Abramoff. Dean dared the repugs to find one Dem who got Abramoff money, and here he is. Once again, Howard Dean makes himself and the Dems look like fools.<br />
<br />Abramoff was not a principal in the Indian Tribes that contributed to Dems in congress and to the Dem party, so Dean insists those contributions do not qualify as graft. Howard Dean just gave a big fat Get Out Of Jail Free card to all the repugs who did get hefty conduit contributions from Abramoff through the tribes.<br />
<br />And how does How How explain to voters that several Dems, including Hillary Clinton, have returned or contributed to charity money they got âfrom Abramoff?â If the money is not tainted, as he insists, why was it returned?<br />
<br />The bozos at DailyKos are all atwitter about Dean taking such a hard line, but they are too politically dumb to recognize that Dean has changed the topic from Republican guilt to Democratic innocence, for the same act. He did exactly what the spin-meisters in the GOP wanted. What an ignorant toolâ¦</div>
