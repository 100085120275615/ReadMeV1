She has stared in a few minor, e.g. straight to video, movies as well as several guest staring rolls on TV shows.  What I most enjoy about her is that she plays an empathetic character well, not to mention that she's very cute.  She is deserving of either a steady roll in TV, which she had with the under watched and under valued <a href="http://www.tv.com/jack-and-bobby/show/21658/summary.html?q=jack%20and%20bobby&tag=search_results;more;0"><span>Jack and Bobby</span></a>, or a supporting roll in a quality movie - something that people will watch.  She's definitely a better actress than Hillary Duff and probably as good as Anne Hathaway.  I hope somebody picks her up for a good roll so she can exit guest roll hell.
