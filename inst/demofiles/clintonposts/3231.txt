<div>I would support Hillary Rodham Clinton if she ran for the Presidency.  I hope she does.<br />
<br />I don't think many people believe in every single platform their candidate of choice has but I believe enough in this candidate to support her run for the presidency.  Common sense has long been lacking, especially with this president, and unlike her husband, I do think Hillary knows what is appropriate and what is not appropriate conduct in the office.<br />
<br />I don't understand the claim that if Hillary ran and lost it would somehow "tarnish" her husband's presidential legacy, as if getting a blow job from an intern and being caught has already done that.<br />
<br />Hillary can run, lose the presidential race,  and run for the Senate again.  What is there to lose, really?</div>
