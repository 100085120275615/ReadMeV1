<br />Nancy Pelosi: "The criminal indictments of a top White House official mark a sad day for America and another chapter in the Republicans' culture of corruption. At the heart of these indictments was the effort by the Bush Administration to discredit critics of its Iraq policy with reckless disregard for national security and the public trust," <br />
<br />What the hell, Nancy? Culture of corruption?  Nancy, the Republican party is no saint, but the Democratic Party may as well be called the Corrupt Party.  I don't even know where to begin!  Did American History start in 2001 when Bush took office?<br />
<br />Here are just a few examples of the Corrupt Party's members: <br />
<br />-5 Democrats in Fairview Illinois who were indicted this year for buying votes. <br />-Alabama state senator Roger Bedford indicted for extortion.<br />-Former Georgia state senator Van Streat. Indicted on bribery charges.  <br />-John Ford of Memphis indicted on federal bribery charges.<br />-Mary Rose Oakar, Ohio.  Indicted on seven felony charges.<br />-James Traficant, Ohio.  Bribery.<br />-Carl Marlinga, Macomb County Prosecuter.  Indicted for conspiracy and fraud.<br />-David Rosen, former Hillary Clinton advisor.  Indicted for filing a false report with the Federal election commission.<br />-Mary Kincaid-Chauncey, Nevada.  Indicted.<br />-Clarence Norman, Brooklyn.  Convicted of campaign finance abuses, under indictment for corruption.<br />
<br />Ok, you get the point.  Now to the grand daddy of them all:  FORMER PRESIDENT Bill Clinton.  I'd love to dredge up all of his crimes, his wife's crimes, and the crimes of his staff over the years, but who has the time?  According to Nancy Pelosi, from the party of the president who actually did commit perjury (among other things), the REPUBLICANS are the corrupt ones. Right.</div>
