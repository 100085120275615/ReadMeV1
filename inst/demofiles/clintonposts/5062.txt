<strong>Hillary the Moderate</strong><br /><br />Anyone who doubts that Hillary Clinton is a moderate, politically speaking, should listen to the likes of Paul Krugman.  Yesterday, on <em>Meet the Press,</em> Krugman expressed disfavor toward her candidacy.  He doesnât think sheâs an egalitarian, as he is.  He thinks she would âtriangulateâ (i.e., compromise) rather than implement a rigid egalitarian vision.  In other words, she doesnât hate the wealthy as much as she should.  Howard Dean and his supporters distrust Clinton for not opposing the war in Iraq.  They do not like it that sheâs committed to a strong American military.  Weâre about to see a fight for the Democrat partyâa fight between Hillary and the moderates on one side and the anti-war, egalitarian crowd on the other.  Whatever the outcome, itâll be interesting to watch.<br />
