<div>Hurricane Katrina evoked the inner moron among our politicians. Here are some choice reactions:<br />
<br />Sen. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana (D) asked President Bush to appoint a cabinet-level official to direct the federal response to the devastation along the Gulf Coast caused by Hurricane Katrina. - <span>Dept of Homeland Security..... D U H!<br />
<br />
</span>Sen. Mary Landrieu (D-LA): "Thank President Clinton and former President Bush for ......... . I thank all the leaders ......... . We are grateful ......... . I want to thank Senator Frist and Senator Reid ........... â <span>Kiss the Ass 101. How about thanking all the people who died and gave you an opportunity to thank everybody else.</span>
<br />
<br />Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco (D) : "These troops know how to shoot and kill, and they are more than willing to do so, and I expect they will". - <span>Yep, that is the first order of the day when a Hurricane hits<br />
<br />
</span>House Speaker Dennis Hastert (R): "It makes no sense to spend billions of dollars to rebuild a city that's seven feet under sea level....It looks like a lot of that place could be bulldozed." - <span>Just because you are the speaker does not mean you have to speak. Wait a minute to think. Maybe a thought might actually come to you and then speak<br />
<br />
</span>FEMA Director Michael Brown,: "Considering the dire circumstances that we have in New Orleans, virtually a city that has been destroyed, things are going relatively well." â <span>Dude, your Arabian Horses are missing you. Please go back to them (www.iaha.com)<br />
<br />
</span>Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff: I have not heard a report of thousands of people in the convention center who don't have food and water. â <span>Maybe you should unmute the TV when you are watching people who do not have food and water<br />
<br />
</span>Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff: Louisiana is a city that is largely under water. â <span>Kids, if you now say Louisiana is a city you still get passing grade<br />
<br />
</span>Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA): I mean, you have people who don't heed those warnings and then put people at risk as a result of not heeding those warnings. There may be a need to look at tougher penalties on those who decide to ride it out and understand that there are consequences to not leaving. â <span>Sure, please let us know what is a tougher penalty than dying of starvation. Maybe you and Gov. Blanco can shoot the poor fucks.</span>
<br />
<span>
<br />
</span>And of course, the incomparable George W. Bush (R)<br />
<ol>   <li>I don't think anyone anticipated the breach of the levees  </li>   <li>
<span>All levels of the government are doing the best they can. So long as any  life is in danger, weâve got work to do - <span>Well that has been clearly proven</span>
<br />
</span>
</li>   <li>
<span>The good news is -- and it's hard for some to see it now -- that out of this chaos is going to come a fantastic Gulf Coast, like it was before. Out of the rubbles of Trent Lott's house -- he's lost his entire house -- there's going to be a fantastic house. And I'm looking forward to sitting on the porch." (Laughter)<br />
</span>
</li>   <li>
<span>Don't buy gas if you don't need it.<br />
</span>
</li>   <li>
<span>
<span>It's totally wiped out. ... It's devastating, it's got to be doubly devastating on the ground</span>. </span>
