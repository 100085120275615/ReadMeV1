<p>My friends and I joke that you only break through the Holy Trinity of Shibboleths around the campfire: those of sex, politics and religion. I just attended three panel sessions at the Conference on College Composition and Communication here in Chicago, and in one too many we had to speak the Shibboleth of Bushbash. </p>

<p>Such the power of it that Iâll quickly add that Iâm registered Independent. And Christian. And moderate. Not a card carrying Republican Evangelical Flag-waving Bushite--as if the phrase is like a German compound noun.</p>

<p>But for many it is: begin the compound noun with Bush and end with stupid. There I was in the  âPraise the Lord and Pass the Legislationâ panel, beholding za Bush Bash. A man who I can only describe as a twitchy Martin Short sans cross dress-- who kept adjusting his glasses--related his horror that some of his students would not embrace the panel of community faith leaders he invited to class. He said, </p>
<p>âMy religious students didnât want to thinkâ and after he said the trigger word âreligiousâ most heads in our room nodded. I raised my hand. âCould it be that the students rejected your panel not so much because the panel was tolerant, but because they were as you said, âcenter, well, left of centerâ faith leaders?â</p>

<p>Sorry, for the âUh . . .duhâ moment to those who were there, but it tried me. Iâm tired of the nervous opening statements of us we be wannabee presenters propping up a question by beginning with a comment bashing the Republican machine as if to say, âIâm not one of them.â Ed from Ohio State and I chatted afterwards. As he put it, âI wonder what those same âreligiousâ students would say if they were here.â Wouldnât it just confirm their worst generalizations and dismissive stereotypes of dammed conspiratorial liberal academic wonks?<br />
 <br />
Now I know the rhetoric of comfort shared among insiders and I know shorthand gestures are endemic to any field. I know 4Câs is often short for Collective Conference for Comp Catharsis. We all periodically need the teacherâs lounge to blow off steam and tell the anecdotal horror story of an indolent student. </p>

<p>But at a national conference can we at least admit the modicum of respect for complexity? And dare we presume that all in the room are of one accord? Could we suspend judgment--that principle we teach again and again to our Freshman English students?</p>

<p>Rhetorically we like to assume Bush-Bash lines as audience pleasersâthe short track to the âhardy-har-harâ crowd hug. Iâm guilty of it. And Iâm also gun shy of calling the conflation of faith and Bush that so many presume. During the preconference Research Network Forum, I gave a presentation on an 18th century Quaker and abolitionist John Woolman. In the Q the A session that followed my presentation, I backed down after a colleague hicupped when I quoted John Woolman as one who believed that God sometimes prepared him to âstand like a trumpet through which the Lord speaks to his flockâ. âThatâs dangerous,â she said, adding, âYou need to know your audience here.â âDangerous?â I asked. She replied, âWell Iâm thinking of Bush . . .â</p>

<p>Bush has already whacked my Christian vocabulary, but now this from the left? Makes me think of Jim Wallisâ inspired title Godâs Politics How the Right Gets it Wrong and the Left Doesnât Get It. As with war, our vocabulary has been reduced: canât say evangelical cause Bush, Rove and the press stole the word . . . canât say an 18th century preacher can actually believed God spoke through him to his congregation . . .Isn't that revolutionary? In her words even with him being a Quaker working âfor issues we likeâ we still must hold such language suspect because we might âget seduced.â Thereâs a thought: being seduced by God. Shibboleth.</p>

<p>The real seduction is how we've silenced many healthy voices of dissent and difference at the conference by assuming the audience is monolithic and imposing our bias, whatever it may be. I wonder along with my colleague Ed from Ohio State whether we can admit to our conversation young men dying in Iraq who might believe in Bush or feel they need to. I wonder if moderates and liberals think we/they have a corner on critical thinking; a corner that turns out to be an ironic curve. The Martin Short man said that maybe the reason those Fundamentalists hate us so much is because us lefties are critical thinkers. Shibboleth.</p>

<p>And what a microcosm of national Democratic hiccups! What an ironic silencing of the âOtherâ; an othering (yes, lefty speak) of people like my libertarian maple syrupping neighbor, who ainât as simple as a mash of descriptors beginning with Bush and ending with stupid; he worked at IBM and advocates private and public cooperative care for the environment. </p>

<p>This conference needs catharsis. It also needs professionalism representative of one big diverse nation. Let us save the bash of the Holy B for Happy Hour. Maybe even add a Hail Hillary, full of grace(lessness).</p>
