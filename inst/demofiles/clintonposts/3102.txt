<div>Have ya heard about Hillary Clintonâs latest brilliant idea?  She says that the maximum speed limit should be 55 MPH around the country.  Doesnât matter what kind of highway, large or small, between big cities or within them.  Everyone should only be allowed to drive 55.<br />
<br />The reason for this?  To save gas.  Haha, ridiculous.<br />
<br />First of all, let me say that I am in favor of not raising speed limits and maybe even lowering them.  I hardly ever drive over the speed limit, mostly to save on gas and be safer.<br />
<br />However, I have several problems with her statement.  First, does she realize how many lives the slower speed limit would save?  Oh, but nevermind that, sheâs only worried about the gas.<br />
<br />Secondly, if she really wants to save gas, how about she give up her plane?  Oh, but sheâs a member of congress, she has to get places, right?  Give me a damn break.<br />
<br />It just seems ridiculous that she can stand up there on her damn high horse flying in her plane, telling us minions that we should drive slower to save gas.<br />
<br />I hate that woman, and she certainly will not be getting my vote in â08.</div>
