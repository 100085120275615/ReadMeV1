<p>A presidential bust of Hillary Clinton is set to be unveiled at the <a href="http://www.museumofsex.com/">Museum of Sex</a> on August 9, 2006 at 10 am. Accentuating her sexual power and bolstered by the presidential seal, The Presidential Bust of Hillary Rodham Clinton: The First Woman President of the United States of America will be officially open for public viewing on August 9 for a limited six week run.</p>

<p>Artist Daniel Edwards describes this new sculpture as capturing Clinton âwith her head held high, a youthful spirit and a face matured by wisdom. Presented in a low cut gown, her cleavage is on display prominently portraying sexual power which some people still consider too threatening.â</p>

<p>Huh? What? Presidential? The museum of sex? Wouldn't a bust of the Clinton presidential intern be more fitting? </p></div>
