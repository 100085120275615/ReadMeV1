<div>Just wanted it on the official record.  The scuttlebutt is growing and growing that the important people in Iowa are leaning more and more away from Hillary.  Just remember, rest of country -- these are the very people that bequeathed for us that Knight in Grayscale Armor, Senatory Kerry.  I wonder who liberal Iowans will decide, with God-like insight and foresight, that conservative Kansans will like best?<br />
<br />So Hillary's too cold, too calculating, too bossy to be president?  Leaving aside the blatant sexism of it all -- which clearly I'm not -- wouldn't it be nice to have a nice bruiser of a Party Boss at the helm?  A real machine politics, cross-me-and-you'll-pay, battle-hardened, experience, not too beholden to idealism and perfection and principal, on OUR side?  Does that sound so bad?<br />
<br />I just want it on record, is all.  If she will go to Mordor, she has my sword.</div>
