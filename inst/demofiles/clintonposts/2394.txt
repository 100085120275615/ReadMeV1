<span>Like many who blog, I have found it pretty hard to sit in front of a computer in a hot little room and write this summer. As I wander around my favorite blog sights, this appears to be a common malady. During this time of year, I really don't want to think much about politics. Having grown up in Chicago I have no shortage of friends and family that are a little bit farther to the left than myself politically. This week we have had the opportunity to visit and share some time with one of my sisters and her family. One discussion this week brought me back to the omnipresent Ms. Clinton.<br />
<br />Over the years my sister, much like myself has become an increasingly conservative person, but my brother-in-law, who has worked in the television news industry all of his adult life has not. As we discussed the pros and cons of Hillary, my sister had one simple question for her husband, which never was answered. "You really won't be able to vote for her, will you?"<br />
<br />This brings me to my own question. Before last year's Iowa Caucus Howard Dean looked unstoppable within the democratic party, but when the time came to stop talking and start voting, real democrats could not pull the lever for Dr. Dean. One has to wonder if Ms. Clinton isn't destine for the same fate. As my sister and my wife put it, could we ever feel safe? </span>
