<div><p>Just before I left Houston I had the opportunity to take a basic knife skills class from my friend Chara. I was a little too busy to be running across town for this class but it was possibly one of the smartest things I've ever done. Chara is a wonderful teacher. Through her new venture <a href="http://urbanchefhouston.com/">Urban Chef</a> she offers a range of classes from "How to Cook" to "Savvy Chef" -- if you're in the Houston area I highly recommend that you sign up for one of Chara's classes. She also has a blog called <a href="http://foodlife.typepad.com/food_life/">food life</a> that you should check out too. </p>

<p>Here's a photo of the couscous we made with diced red onion, green onion, green pepper and tomato. Good golly... I had NO idea how small you had to make those pieces of veggie to officially be called <i>diced</i>. <br />

<p>And a shot (a little dark sorry about that) of Julienned carrots with red wine vinegar, salt and pepper. (The pieces I did are the blobby ones.)<br />

<p>Oh, and here's something else that I eat up: Domino magazine. It is my drug of choice. Hi, my name is Laurie, and I'm a Dominoaholic.<br />

<p><b>Oh-my-goodness</b><br />
Did anyone else see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hillarylang/223877385/">what Hillary made</a>? Good golly that woman is crazy creative. I guess I'll have to add Wee Wonderfuloholic to my introduction too. </p>

<p>p.s. Mark noticed that I used the phrase "good golly" too much and thinks it's because I've seen that TV commercial with Little Richard too many times. Is Little Richard the one who sang that song <i>Good, Golly, Miss, Molly</i>? I thought it was someone else... Chuck something. </p>

<p><i>Rats!</i> I just Googled it and Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Golly,_Miss_Molly">confirmed his accusation</a>. I guess this outs me as a TV watcher too. Hey, I'm not the <a href="http://rosylittlethings.typepad.com/posie_gets_cozy/2006/08/stripey_sweater.html">only one who loves their TV</a>.</p></div>
