<div>Hillary has announced that she is going to join the other barking moonbats and jumps on the bandwagon and gives up all hope as campaigning as a moderate and announces she will also vote for a filibuster much to the Republicans delight. She had this to say about her decision:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>I oppose his nomination and support efforts to block his confirmation. <br />
<br />I do not think Judge Alito would advance the principles Americans hold most dear</blockquote>
<br />Like I said before, the barking moonbat brigade will try to head off any attempt to put anyone but another Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the bench. As long as the Republicans are in control, they will not allow that to happen again. A top GOP official had this to say about any filibuster attempt:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>If the Democratic left does a filibuster led by Kerry, that's found money for us.</blockquote>
<br />There are repercussions of course, like alienate the moderate Democrats while appeasing the KOS and DU crowd!</div>
