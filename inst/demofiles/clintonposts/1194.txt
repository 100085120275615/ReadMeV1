Everest walked past a man dying of oxygen deficiency.  Their goal of reaching the summit was evidently more important to them then making an effort to save the British mountaineer's life; he eventually died.<br /><br />Luke (10:29-37) gives us the story of the good Samaritan who went out of his way to help a man left half dead by robbers.  The priest and Levite ignored the dying man and callously walked past, yet a lowly Samaritan showed compassion and helped:  <blockquote>"But a Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, and when he saw him, he had compassion. He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him." Luke 10: 33,34 ESV</blockquote>The guilty climbers in this article;   <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060524/ap_on_re_au_an/everest_abandoned_climber_4">Hillary rips climbers who left dying man</a>, will forever be haunted by their lack of compassion for a fellow human being.  Life is often of little importance to the self-centered who put their ambitions far above the well-being of their companions.  It would be interesting to know how they would feel if it was their son, or father, who they left lying in the snow to die!<br /><br />Before condemning these men to Satan's future habitation;  don't we basically do the same thing every day these 40 mountaineers are guilty of;  walking past men and women who are dying in sin without Jesus and never offering help, or a word of encouragement?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060524/ap_on_re_au_an/everest_abandoned_climber_4"></a><br /><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060524/ap_on_re_au_an/everest_abandoned_climber_4"> </a>
