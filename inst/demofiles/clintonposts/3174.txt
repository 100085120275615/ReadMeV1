<div>I have a sense that, for both parties, the Iowa caucus is going to decide the nominee. John Kerry barely broke a sweat after his shocking victory, and Bush and Gore were able to overcome strong challenges in New Hampshire in 2000 after having won Iowa. That's why I'm skeptical of Hillary's prospects, and think that Edwards (who's <a href="http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060611/NEWS09/606110338/1001/archive">leading</a> in Iowa) has the best shot at the nomination. But I had just assumed that John McCain was leading the Republican field in Iowa. I guess <a href="http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060823/NEWS09/608230368/1056">I was wrong</a>:
<blockquote>Former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani leads the field of prospective Republican presidential candidates in Iowa, according to a poll of likely GOP caucus-goers published Tuesday.<br />
Giuliani received support from 30 percent of Republicans expecting to attend the 2008 caucuses, the survey by Victory Enterprises shows.<br />
Roughly 29 percent of the 400 likely caucus-goers surveyed by the Davenport-based company said they were undecided about whom they would support, followed by Sen. John McCain of Arizona with 17.3 percent.</blockquote>
Via <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2006/08/23/giuliani_leads_in_iowa.html">Taegan</a>. The amazing thing is that Iowa Republicans - by a 70% to 30% margin - describe themselves as "pro-life". That the pro-choice, pro-gay Giuliani is able to overcome that to take such a commanding lead is extraordinary. Now, of course, an electorate that's 29% undecided leaves lots of room for change, and this result is not final by any means. But Giuliani would likely take New York in the general, and could make it a race in regularly solid-blue states. While he would be nowhere near as objectionable as John McCain, he might have a better chance at winning the general. Whether that's a good or a bad thing, I don't know.</div>
