<div>The New York Times is reporting that the House of Reps. is attempting to give breaks on royalties due from oil companies that are drilling for oil in unexplored areas.  This is after the United States may be liable for $24 billion in royalties already.  This is unacceptable.<br />
<br />If you are not aware of the story, back in the 90s, under the Clinton administration, the Energy Department was concerned that there was not enough exploration for oil in the United States, and that it was severly unable to deal with an energy crisis should one arise.  Oil prices were so low back then, that the profits that they were to make on any oil, would probably be eaten up by the costs of searching and then drilling for it.  So, in order to entice exploration for oil by oil companies, they said that any oil they were to find on federal, public lands would be exempt from royalties imposed on it by the federal government.<br />
<br />A couple of years later, oil prices skyrocketed and there was no longer a reason for the royalty releases, because the oil could fetch huge prices on the open market.  The intelligent thing to do, according to one of the architects of the original royalty release under the Clinton administration would be to end the handouts.  But the fantastically well-funded oil lobby is on the case and pressuring House representatives to continue giving away public oil while demanding less compensation for the American public, in return (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/27/business/27royalties.html?pagewanted=all">Vague Law and Hard Lobbying Add Up to Billions for Big Oil, NY Times</a>):<br />

<blockquote>"There is no cost rationale," said Shirley J. Neff, an economist at <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/c/columbia_university/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Columbia University.">Columbia University</a> and Senator Johnston's top legislative aide in drafting the 1995 royalty law. "It is astounding to me that the administration would so blatantly cave in to the industry's demands."</blockquote>
<p></p>Yes, there is no economic rationale for this.  Gale Norton, under the current Bush administration, continued the policy for 2004.  Her decision was supposed to have saved $570 million for the public a year.  But, there was never really a reason to add more incentives to drill, because oil prices were already high enough to provide a suitable incentive.<br />
<br />This is a huge swindle--the Neo-Teapot Dome (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teapot_Dome">Wikipedia Teapot Dome Entry</a>).  Hopefully, thanks to the New York Time coverage of it, it will not be allowed to continue.</div>
