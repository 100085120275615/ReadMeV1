As I <a href="http://awelshmaninmilano.blogspot.com/2005/10/new-law-is-born.html" target="_blank">wrote back in October</a>, the law, first drafted by Edmondo Cirielli also known as the "Save Previti" law and the "Cerami Bill", was seen as a means to streamline <span lang="EN-GB">Italy</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">âs megalithic legal system. It also seemed custom-made to give Previti a chance to escape his prison sentence. The outcry over the effect that the Bill would have had on the rest of </span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Italy</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">âs convicted felons ensured that <a href="http://www.agi.it/english/news.pl?doc=200511071645-1160-RT1-CRO-0-NF11&page=0&amp;id=agionline-eng.oggitalia" target="_blank">changes</a> were made to reduce any possible advantage to Previti and his other inmates in prisons throughout </span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Italy</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> though. The resulting Bill still contains some highly contentious changes to Constitutional law however.<br /><br /></span><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">In the English-speaking world, the law seems to have escaped attention so far. That is to say, it has escaped the scrutiny of the mainstream press. It has caused <a href="http://www.billboard.biz/bb/biz/newsroom/global/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001611710" target="_blank">quite a stir </a>in the music world, however, as it is seen to be a huge problem for the music, video and computer software industry watchdogs in their <a href="http://www.ifpi.com/site-content/press/20040608.html" target="_blank">fight</a> against copyright <a href="http://www.grayzone.com/ifpi33100.htm" target="_blank">piracy </a>in </span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Italy, long <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/1996/03/16/pirate.t.php" target="_blank">known to be a centre </a>of illegal copying and distribution</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span><br /></span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The <a href="http://www.ifpi.org/" target="_blank">IFPI</a> claims that as many as 75% of outstanding criminal antipiracy trials will be stopped before they have the chance to be taken to court. IFPI Chairman and CEO John Kennedy said: "<em>The Ex-Cirielli law deals a huge blow to the Italian music industry and to all IP industries in the country. This law totally undermines our ability to fight piracy in a nation with one of the highest rates of piracy in the developed worldâ¦ This bill will erode investment in music, encourage organised crime, fuel corruption and cost the Italian government tens of millions of euros in lost revenue. It will bring </em></span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><em>Italy</em></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><em> out of line with other European nations and put it firmly on the map as a pirate music market</em>."</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span><br /></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Pretty strong stuff. </span><span lang="EN-GB">Enzo Mazza, Chairman of the Federation of the Italian Music Industry (<a href="http://www.fimi.it/profilo.asp" target="_blank">FIMI</a>) said: "<em>This is an important setback in </em></span><span><em><span lang="EN-GB">Italy</span><span lang="EN-GB">âs fight to tackle its longstanding piracy problems.

In the Court of Assizes in </span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Genoa</span></span><span lang="EN-GB">, where there is currently being heard the â<a href="http://www.italymag.co.uk/2005/news-from-italy/current-affairs/g8-trial-against-28-top-police-officers-reopens-in-genoa/" target="_blank">Diaz/Bolzaneto Trial</a>â, there is the feeling that the trial will be inevitably blocked by the new law. So much so, in fact, that everyone there was getting the feeling that proceedings were being <a href="https://www.supportolegale.org/?q=node/460" target="_blank">deliberately slowed down </a>so that the law could be passed and brought into play.<br /><br /></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">As if <a href="http://www.corriere.it/english/articoli/2005/11_Novembre/30/castelli.shtml" target="_blank">that were not enough</a>, Minister of Justice Roberto Castelli said that: âThere will be several thousand more repeat offenders.â Going on to say, â <em>It is not possible to make a reliable estimate but it is reasonable to suppose that the Ex-Cirielli law will lead in the medium term to thousands more prisoners, which we cannot handle without new resources. I have been asking for new resources for months</em>â, concluded Mr Castelli. â<em>If I do not obtain any results, I take no responsibility for what may happen</em>â.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span><br /></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">Confused? Well, the new law covers several main areas of interest. Firstly, it reduces the time for which a crime can be prosecuted from 7Â½ years to 6. Secondly, it allows for the accused to request his trial be moved to another region if he (I havenât mentioned Berlusconi yet, have I?) believes that he will not get a fair trial in the region that has prosecuted him. The original intention to enable all of the trials curently before the courts to be included - hence the "Save Previti" tag - has been reduced to only including crimes of violence and personal attack, bringing about the situation that Minister Castelli was complaining of.</span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span><br /></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span> </span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB">The bill has not had an easy passage through parliament. Some 3 years ago, <a href="http://www.sundayherald.com/print28786" target="_blank">Hillary Clark </a>wrote for the Sunday Herald that: "<span lang="EN-GB"><em>Berlusconi's 'piano players' get the bird </em></span><span lang="EN-GB"><em>in multiple-voting and corruption scandal</em>".
