<p>In 2008, we can bet on one thing at least:that every candidates dirt will be dug through thoroughly and brought to light. Plus, each side will invent some lies about the other, too.</p>
<p>What Hillary really is, lib or moderate, is irrelevant. Average reps already see her as liberal, and it wouldn&#8217;t take much smearing to reinforce that. I doubt many Religious Right leaders fear her. She would just let them beat the abortion and gay marriage drums even louder. YAY! Even more loathing and polarization! I say that if Hillary loves America, she will not run just to prevent any more polarization, the last thing we really need. My dream ticket:Mitt Romney and Evan Bayh or a different moderate-left Dem. But good luck with that. Neither &#8220;energizes the base,&#8221; the Holy Grail of campaigning. </p>
<p>Nope. We&#8217;ll see plenty of gay-bashing, anti-abortion, &#8220;liberals hate the family and they hate America,&#8221; crap from Republicans and lots of Bushco and Iraq bashing, vast right-wing conspiracies and talk about the Religious Right from Dems. If Reps win Dems will say they stole the election, if Dems win Reps will blame the liberal media. I love America.</p>
