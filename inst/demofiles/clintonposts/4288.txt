<p><img class="picture" height="33" hspace="20" src="http://www.4condi.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/Google%20PR%206.jpg" width="137" align="left" vspace="10" border="0" />Thanks to your online efforts:, surfing the Internet, commenting on blogs, posting trackback links, and carrying the Condista message; your efforts have paid off in a form of online recognition that is difficult to achieve. Our main website and blog have achieved a Google PageRank<sup>TM</sup> of 6, and 4, respectively. (Displayed on the right hand side bar.) Now, unless you&#8217;re a computer geek, you may not be familiar with this <a title="" href="http://www.google.com/technology/" target="_blank">term</a> and its importance. But for a website that is only now approaching its second year in operation, it&#8217;s quite an accomplishment, and due, in no small part, to your efforts. (And you thought you were just wasting time on the Internet!)</p>
<p>Websites live and die depending on traffic. And website traffic is most directly dependent on &#8220;search engine placement&#8221; for the &#8220;key words&#8221; that people use to search for your site. Even if you have the best website, it is essentially worthless if nobody can find it. For example, if you sell antique jewelry on your website and your website is number 487 on the list when someone does a Google search for &#8220;antique jewelry&#8221; your website probably will not be receiving a lot of traffic, or business &#8212; at least not from Google. There is an entire &#8220;Search Engine Optimization&#8221; industry that does nothing but try to move websites up the list of search results for the key words that apply to each particular website. Sounds easy, but there is no fixed formula for success because Google isn&#8217;t telling anyone exactly how they &#8220;rank&#8221; websites. (They consider it a &#8220;trade secret,&#8221; and the term PageRank<sup>TM</sup> is a registered trade mark.) They don&#8217;t want website operators to &#8220;game the system&#8221; and have Google searches return irrelevant results &#8212; because then Google would lose traffic to other search engines that return more relevant, focused results. There have even been lawsuits regarding Google and its mysterious PageRank<sup>TM</sup> system. (To the best of my knowledge, Google won these cases.)</p>
<p>Although no one knows exactly how Google and most other search engines determine a website&#8217;s relative importance, PageRank<sup>TM</sup> is based on traffic, links from other related sites (the more &#8220;important&#8221; the site the better), how long a website has been in operation, how often the website is updated, the frequencies of of various words, etc. These evaluations are done automatically by Internet &#8220;spiders&#8221; that crawl a site looking for all of these attributes. Generally, more is better, but not always. Links that come from &#8220;paid link&#8221; sites, &#8220;circular&#8221; linking schemes to duplicate websites, hidden text with multiple occurences of the same keywords, etc. can lead to a website being &#8220;sandboxed&#8221; &#8212; removed from search engine results &#8212; cyberspace&#8217;s &#8220;kiss of death.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, everytime that you &#8220;surf the net&#8221; and visit our site, you just became another &#8220;unique visitor&#8221; for that day, a positive factor. Everytime you comment, or post on another website, with links back to our website (and don&#8217;t forget a separate link to the blog as well!) you increase our link numbers, also a positive factor, unless done so frivilously. (For example, it is a well-known tactic to post comments on other blogs just to create these links &#8212; so called &#8220;comment spam.&#8221; It can lead to getting &#8220;black listed&#8221; in short order. If you have a personal relationship with a blog, or website, operator; you can ask them to link to us, and if appropriate, we can reciprocate. Obviously, links from larger, established websites are more &#8220;valuable&#8221; than links to someone&#8217;s personal website that is rarely updated with pictures of their cat from last Christmas. You can view a website&#8217;s PageRank<sup>TM</sup> (not to mention spell check, translate, map US addresses by downloading the <strong>free</strong> Google toolbar for use with Internet Explorer, or FireFox, browsers.

Just be sure get there through one of the links, or banners, on our website, or blog. (We get credit for that too.) There are close to 3000 other politically oriented blogs on Blog Explosion, and you can limit your surfing to these sites. Granted, much of the traffic is hit and run, BUT you will run across some interesting contacts for the future, and <strong>where appropriate</strong> you can leave a comment with a link back to us &#8212; thus magnifying the benefit. On some websites you may have to manually type in the links back to our website and blog into your comments. (I suggest that you &#8220;cut and paste&#8221; them from this post until you are comfortable with this little snippet of HTML.)</p>

<p>So, just how good is a Page Rank of &#8220;6&#8243; for our main website page, and &#8220;4&#8243; for our blog&#8217;s mainpage? The scale is from 0 to 10. Most individual blogs and websites are 0-3, maybe 4 if they&#8217;re popular and been around awhile. HillPAC&#8217;s <a title="" href="http://www.hillpac.com/" target="_blank">website</a> (Hillary&#8217;s political action committee) is a 5, and the &#8220;Time to go Joe&#8221; <a title="" href="http://www.timetogojoe.com/" target="_blank">website</a> trying to oust Joe Lieberman is a 5. Nationally syndicated radio talk show host <a title="" href="http://www.michaelmedved.com/" target="_blank">Michael Medved</a> is a 6. The websites for <a title="" href="http://www.michellemalkin.com" target="_blank">Michelle Malkin</a>, the <a title="" href="http://www.rnc.org/" target="_blank">RNC</a>, and <a title="" href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com" target="_blank">Rush Limbaugh</a> are all 7&#8217;s. <a title="" href="http://www.usnews.com" target="_blank">US News and World Report</a> is an 8. <a title="" href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo!</a> is a 9. And <a title="" href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google</a> itself is, surprise, surprise, a 10. So, we&#8217;re in really good company on our main website, and considering that our blog is just 2 months old, a 4 is phenomenal. </p>
<p>So thanks again for your efforts. They have made, and are making, a big difference.</p>
