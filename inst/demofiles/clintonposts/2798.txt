<div><p>The <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-senrace-poll-0803,0,7774778.story?coll=hc-big-headlines-breaking" target="_blank">new Quinnipiac poll</a> is out today:</p><blockquote><p>Lamont has support from 54 percent of likely Democrat voters in the new Quinnipiac University poll, while Lieberman has support from 41 percent of voters. A similar poll July 20 showed Lamont with a slight advantage for the first time in the campaign.</p></blockquote><p>And don't miss this quote (bold mine):</p><blockquote><p><strong>"Senator Lieberman's campaign bus seems to be stuck in reverse,"</strong> poll director Douglas Schwartz said. "Despite visits from former President Bill Clinton and other big-name Democrats, Lieberman has not been able to stem the tide to Lamont."</p></blockquote><p>I can't wait to vote for <a href="http://nedlamont.com/" target="_blank">Ned</a>!</p></div>
