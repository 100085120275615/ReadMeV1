<div>I received the following email from one of my research sources, Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI). This is probably the best news parents have been waiting for. It's only a start, however, to raise the standards of school-sponsored deals made with the fast-food industry. It's up to us to keep pressure on our legislators to keep the ball rolling. CSPI advises:<br />
<br />"Please urge your Senators and Representative to cosponsor the Harkin âChild Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protectionâ bill that would improve the nutritional quality of school foods by updating the nutrition standards for all foods and beverages sold in schools throughout the school day, including in vending machines, snack lines, and school stores. The current standards are out dated and out of sync with current nutrition science and with childrenâs diets and health concerns." <br />
<br />See link and SAMPLE EMAIL below.<br />
<br />For your information, Senator Harkin of Iowa, has been actively pressing his colleagues to reduce the influence of fast-food/junk-food companies on our youth, including a ban on certain marketing schemes that our chilren are exposed to. Also, as I have noted before, Former President Clinton, through his Foundation, has been vigorously advocating education reform to address the epidemic of Childhood Obesity. Bill and I are both victims of Childhood Obesity, and we suffer its consequences to this day, at the age of 59 (I'm 6 months his elder).<br />
<br />EMAIL From CSPI:<br />
<br />Yesterday's announcement that the member companies of the<br />American Beverage Association (ABA) - including Coke and Pepsi -<br />will voluntarily pull soda out of elementary schools is an<br />encouraging step from an industry that, up to now, has thwarted<br />angry parents who want to get soda out of their kids' schools.<br />The handwriting is on the wall and industry clearly hopes this<br />voluntary half-step will forestall efforts to get soda out of<br />all schools.<br />
<br />Given the high visibility of childhood obesity and efforts to<br />ban soda and junk foods in school, you will probably see an<br />article in your local newspaper about the ABA's announcement.<br />You can help support real efforts to get soda and junk foods out<br />of schools and expose the soda industries' half-measures by<br />writing a letter to the editor of your local newspaper urging<br />Congress act to ensure that schools sell only healthful drinks<br />and snacks to all children.<br />
<br />Below are some talking points you may wish to include in your<br />letter. If your letter is published, please send a copy to CSPI,<br />c/o Grassroots Dept., 1875 Connecticut Ave., NW #300,<br />Washington, DC 20009.<br />
<br />* Congress should pass legislation that calls on the U.S.<br />Department of Agriculture to update its nutrition standards for<br />foods sold out of vending machines, snack lines, and other<br />venues to rid schools of junk food and provide more healthy food<br />choices to children.<br />
<br />* Given that poor diet and obesity are problems among teens,<br />soda has no place in America's high schools and middle schools,<br />which are much bigger markets for soda companies than elementary<br />schools.<br />
<br />* While childhood obesity is skyrocketing, many of our nation's<br />schools raise funds by selling soda, candy, and other<br />low-nutrition foods to children. The soda industry has<br />aggressively, and shamefully, taken advantage of the precarious<br />financial position of many public school systems.<br />
<br />* Currently, low-nutrition foods are widely available at schools<br />in vending machines, snack lines, and school stores. The most<br />common items sold out of these venues are soda, fruit drinks,<br />candy, chips, and cookies. Children's diets are too high in<br />calories, saturated fat, trans fat, refined sugars and sodium,<br />which contribute to health problems such as obesity, heart<br />disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and tooth decay. Over the<br />last two decades, rates of obesity have doubled in children and<br />tripled in adolescents.<br />
<br />* The federal government invests significant resources in the<br />school meal programs and has strong nutrition standards for<br />those meals. Foods sold out of vending machines, school stores,<br />and other venues do not have to meet similar nutrition<br />standards. Selling low-nutrition foods in schools undermines the<br />national investment in school meals, undermines parents' ability<br />to feed their children a healthy diet, and undermines children's<br />health.<br />

<br />Dear [ Decision Maker ],<br />
<br />I strongly urge you to cosponsor Senator Harkin's "Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection" bill that would improve the nutritional quality of school foods by updating the definition of "food of minimal nutritional value" to be consistent with current nutrition science.  Nutrition science has evolved significantly since 1979, when USDA defined "foods of minimal nutritional value" (FMNV).  <br />
<br />As you know, over the last two decades, rates of obesity have doubled in children and tripled in adolescents.  And children's poor diets are negatively affecting their health.  Currently, low-nutrition foods are widely available outside of the school meals programs in vending machines, snack lines, and school stores.  The most common items sold out of these venues are high in calories, saturated fat, trans fat, cholesterol, refined sugars, or sodium, which contribute to health problems such as obesity, heart disease, cancer, stroke, diabetes, and tooth decay.<br />
<br />The federal government invests significant resources in the school meal programs and has strong nutrition standards for those meals.  Selling low-nutrition foods through other venues in schools undermines that investment, undermines parents' ability to feed their children a healthy diet, and undermines children's health.<br />
<br />Again, I urge you to cosponsor the bill to update the definition of "food of minimal nutritional value."  I look forward to hearing your position on this legislation to promote children's health. <br />
