</a>In a <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/scott-thill/ding-dong-the-witch-isn_b_22533.html" target="blank">past post on the Zarqawi assassination</a>, I used the phrase "The more things change the more they remain the same," an aphorism that garnered some grumpy comments from those who evidently felt the flippancy that statement didn't fit our current, uber-serious geopolitical situation. Yeah, right. While it may have been Marx (<a href="http://www.marxists.org" target="blank">Karl</a>, not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groucho_Marx" target="blank">Groucho</a>) who coined that sentiment's more memorable manifestation -- "History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce" -- the phrase has legs far beyond Marxism, communism or whatever other "ism" the United States has been trashing while it proffers an extreme version of its own favorite: Capitalism.<br />
<br />Take the rise of Ned Lamont, for example, who predictably handed Joe Lieberman's sorry ass to him the other day, with a nice kick out of the Democratic Party as a chaser. That victory had all the climactic drama of Julia Child cooking how-to: Anyone worth their salt (or grasp of history, and its astonishing circularity) knew that Loserman had no chance, having sold out the Democratic Party not just during the Bush administration's disaster capitalism misadventure in Iraq (and now, evidently, in Lebanon) but also during his short time with Al Gore and his longer, more knotted relationship with Bill Clinton. That Clinton came aboard to help Leiberman generate some much-needed Joe-mentum was as predictable as Lieberman's ignominious defeat: Bill and Hillary learned long ago the benefits of playing the middle against both sides.<br />
<br />But it was not to be, and the resultant PR campaigns from both the Republicans and Lieberman himself have been instructive. Sample a couple, won't you? I found them while <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-assess10aug10,0,2825316.story" target="blank">snoring over the LA Times</a> this morning:<br />
<br />
<b>Dick "Darth Vader" Cheney</b>: "A man like Lieberman [was] pushed aside because of his willingness to support an aggressive posture in terms of our national security strategy."<br />
<b>Republican Jewish Coalition</b>: A "voice of support for Israel [has been] silenced by the Democratic Party."<br />
<b>The Uber Loserman</b>:"I think it's time for somebody to break through the dominance of both parties by the margins of the parties...I think it's time for somebody to break through and say, 'Hey, let's cut out the partisan nonsense.'"<br />
<br />OK, to be fair, that last zinger was delivered to Matt "Marshmallow" Lauer on <i>The Today Show</i>, but that relatively insignificant (the Times reported it, after all) fact-check is way more than you're going to get from the patently disingenuous Lieberman, who after being politically emasculated in front of the whole world still couldn't manage to remember that it is in fact rampant Democratic centrism, and its specific coddling of the Republican fringe, that has brought us to the brink of economic collapse and endless war. <br />
<br />If the "margin" of the Democratic party had any power at all, Gore wouldn't have handed the White House over to Bush in 2000 with his blessing and zero fight, and Kerry wouldn't have done the same in 2004. They would have done what the Republicans did in the same circumstances, which is fight their asses off and fight dirty. Which, as anyone who's ever been in a real fight understands, is often one of the only ways you win a fight at all.<br />
<br />If the "margin" of the party had any pull at all, the hapless Terry McAuliffe and the DNC wouldn't have cut an ascendant, tough-talking Howard Dean's balls off in the Democratic primary, that is before making him head of, what else, the DNC when the coast was clear, Kerry had the nomination under wraps, and the Democrats were safely squired away for yet another electoral ass-kicking. Speaking of, if the Democratic  "margin" was seriously empowered, all of that electoral tampering, jacking and hacking -- which has only grown worse with the passage of time -- would be under the legislative microscope rather than a fringe issue to be insulted by, well, pretty much everyone. Yes, the Democratic "fringe" wants safe, verifiable elections. That they've been hamstrung by Democratic pretenders like Lieberman, Zell Miller (remember him?), Hillary Clinton and more is evidence for the incontrovertible truth that the middle-of-the-road Democrats have thrown the party off course. In the process, their integrity, reliability and spirit has been called into question, even more so now that Loserman is leaving the party because they broke all his toys. Cry me a river, Joe. Just make sure it's not the Euphrates, dig me?<br />
<br />Of course, the poverty of Lieberman's claims have been proven not by the Democrats but rather the Republicans he's been bedding down with, many of whom have voiced support for his independent run. Like they care, and like it will work. The more Loserman clones in the party and country alike decide that they want nothing to do with the party -- "Yes I'm a proud Democrat," Loserman told Lauer, "but I'm more devoted to my state and my country than I am to my party" -- the more the party will coalesce and mature without their poisonous postures. Do the Democrats miss Zell Miller? Does crack cure cancer?<br />
<br />Meanwhile, the Republicans are once again trying to squeeze blood from a stone and spin a portentous defeat into a positive. To do that, they're trying to contextualize the waves of dissent drowning Democratic incumbents and pretenders nationwide as a return to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_McGovern" target="blank">George McGovern's peacenik days of yore</a>, summed up most succinctly in the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-goldberg10aug10,0,860326.column" target="blank">ramblings of knee-jerker Jonah Goldberg</a>. It is a convenient allusion given the Republicans' overt reliance on the "cut and run" mythos, which should implode right about the time their party does in 2008. Hopefully, the country itself will be able to dodge those shards, but given the tenacious igorance of the Bush administration, I'm not hopeful on that count. Like all intellectually challenged thugs, Bush and his tools will go down swinging. Make sure to duck.<br />
<br />But back to McGovern who rightly channeled national distaste for the Vietnam quagmire into a party platform, in the process becoming one of the country's most visible progressives. Goldberg, Mehlman and other Republican apologists and operatives are hoping that what I call the McGovern Mantra will galvanize the hawkish Democrats and Independents to throw their support behind the Republicans, who can make war with the best of them, but not much else. But they're forgetting a couple things, and this is where Marx's aphorism comes in handy:<br />
<br />1) Americans suck at history<br />2) Americans are tired of farce<br />
<br />For one, among the voting populace, there are probably more Republicans than Democrats who remember that McGovern got his ass kicked by Richard Nixon in a 1972 landslide. But if I was a betting man (and I am), I'd bet the house that there are countless more voters who remember how the disgraced victor of that presidential race was forced to vacate the White House after, well, basically coming unhinged. In the history books, McGovern looks like a sage compared to Nixon, and he even voted for the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution. <br />
<br />No, trying to paint the impending Democratic tidal wave into the McGovern corner won't work, and not just because Americans can't remember pretty much anything before Reagan. In fact, the more Republicans try to tab Lieberman, or any other hawkish Democrat, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoop_Jackson" target="blank">the second coming of Scoop Jackson</a>, the more they'll get caught in the late Demo hawk's posthumous dragnet. After all, Jackson may have been a war-loving Democrat (he wasn't called the "Senator from Boeing" for no reason), but he also served as tutor to the war in Iraq's architects, from Paul Wolfowitz to Douglas Feith to Elliott Abrams and onward. <br />
<br />In fact, the legacy of Scoop is inextricable from our pointless war in Iraq, a demonstration of American power and might that Jackson may have loved to witness, but one that is nonethless hollow and ineffective. That Scoop Jackson has become a beacon to neocons everywhere alone should make the Marxists in the room smile, for what is our quagmire in Iraq if not a rerun of the same one that occurred in Vietnam? What is the neoconservative movement if not a flawless 21st-century manifestation of Jackson's flawed 20th-century political philosophy?<br />
<br />And, to get even more circular, what is the Bush administration if not a postmodern equivalent of the Nixon administration, one that was hounded from office by a public and body politic simply too sick to survive its farce? The same faces are there: Rumsfeld, Cheney, the list goes on. And what are our current military misadventures in the Middle East (and by that I am counting our Bush-brokered, carbon-copy Israeli invasion and occupation of Lebanon) but phantoms of failed campaigns of yesteryear? What is Israel's present excursion in Lebanon but a rerun of <a href="http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/article1218049.ece" target="blank">the same botched occupation, circa 1982</a>? <br />
<br />The kicker? Scoop Jackson probably wouldn't have signed on for it. After all, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/com-11_23_05_FH.html" target="blank">he cried foul when Reagan sent American troops into Lebanon the first time around</a>, arguing that "The danger of Americans being killed, the danger of divisiveness that would accrue from those developments ... are all too real. A superpower should not play that kind of role in a cauldron of trouble, because sooner or later we are going to get hurt." Some hawk. Some defender of Israel.<br />
<br />And this is who Joseph Lieberman is supposed to remind us of? This is the guy who is supposed to be the model Democrat for our times, times which look more and more like those we already survived and supposedly solved? If Scoop Jackson's philosophy of overwhelming American force in the face of evil is, pardon the pun, bulletproof, then why is the Bush administration still trying to get <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/ap/2006/08/09/ap2939284.html" target="blank">retroactive immunity from possible war crimes</a>? Why would they need it, given their unshaken belief in their own moral and political superiority? What are they afraid of?<br />
<br />History, for one, returning once more to Marx. As with Nixon, history will not be kind to Bush and other neocons who have built their names (and graves) atop the so-called wisdom of Scoop Jackson, a guy who couldn't even get an airport named after him in his home state of Washington. No, history will judge this band of losers (Loserman included) harshly, perhaps concluding that this president and his administration were in fact among the worst in American history. As their narrative unravels, the bodies that keep piling up (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/09/AR2006080901773.html" target="blank">1,815 corpses in Iraq in the month of July alone</a>) will come back to haunt them. <br />
<br />Just like history is supposed to do. Pleasant nightmares, Mr. President.</div>
