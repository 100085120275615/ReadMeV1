My husband bought it for me the day it came out and my friend and I both re-watched the whole season.  Although we had missed the first 7 episodes so those were new for us.  So I'm pretty excited that Season 2 starts tonight on my birthday of all days.  It's a very cool birthday present.  <a href="http://www.sharpshooters.blogspot.com/">Wyatt</a> is a fellow Prison Break fan as well and <a href="http://sharpshooters.blogspot.com/2006/08/break-out-party-favors.html">posted on his excitement about the show returning</a>.<br /><br /><span>The MEME of Three</span><br /><a href="http://gluxian.blogspot.com/2006/08/sigh-another-tag.html">(I found this at Shoprat's)</a><br /><br />1.
