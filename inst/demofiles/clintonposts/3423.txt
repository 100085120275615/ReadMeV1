<div>National Democrats are looking in amazement as the environment changes before their very eyes in Pennsylvania. Bobby Casey Jr., the hand-picked puppet of Democrats Barbra Streisand, George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Teddy Kennedy, and Michael Moore has fast become a political joke as hard-working Pennsylvanians realize what his campaign is about...negativity, opportunism, and Santorum hate.<br />
<br />This is evident in a flood of new polling information suggesting the race has tightened considerably in the last several weeks. Both Muhlenberg College and now <a href="http://www.politicspa.com/temp/casey_leads_santorum_48.htm">Quinnipiac</a> have the race within 6 points - and it is only the middle of August! As more voters become familiar with Rick's record of accomplishment and his commitment to Pennsylvania families, you will see these numbers continue to close. The yellow-lights are flashing at Casey camp, as also stated by the NRSC, and it is apparent that an implosion similar to Casey's failed gubernatorial run four years ago is coming on the horizon. When the chips are down, the voters of Pennsylvania know that Bobby Casey ducks and hides from the issues while Santorum fights alongside them from inside the foxhole.<br />
<br />Casey's dire circumstances and Santorum's strength have caught the attention of Talk Show Host Don Imus, who recently re-endorsed Santorum's reelection bid. On his Monday morning (8/14/06) edition of "Imus in the Morning," this conversation ensued between Imus and his co-host:<br />
<br />

<blockquote>
<span>IMUS: All I know about Santorum is -- which I don't agree with him<br />on much -- but what I like about him is he's a decent, honest guy and he kept<br />his word on the combating autism deal.<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; He did indeed.<br />
<br />IMUS: So did [Senator] Dodd -- and a bunch others -- but particularly<br />Santorum and we've done other things with Santorum. Remember going back to<br />raising the death benefits for these soldiers killed in Iraq and everywhere<br />else...<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; A man of his word.<br />
<br />IMUS: Santorum was one of the original guys that kept his word on that.<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.<br />
<br />IMUS: So, you have to be serious, obviously, duh. All I can say about Santorum is, in every instance that we've had anything to deal with him, he's (one) kept his word which leads me to suspect he probably keeps his word. </span>
<span>
<strong>
<em>You may not agree with him on everything, but I would rather have somebody like that -- at least I would know what the deal was -- than some weasel who you had no idea.</em>
</strong>
<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; Some former politician's son, some nepotism deal.<br />
<br />IMUS: Yeah, what's that all about?</span>
</blockquote>
</span>

<br />Don Imus then went on to say that he still believes Santorum will win in November. Let's keep up the fight and show Washington, Massachusetts, and Hollywood liberals what we are made of! On to victory...</div>
