Repeating/rewording the WaPo story--as was done on most blogs who touched the topic--scarcely qualifies as discussion. [Of course, there might be analyses of this (as a mean's of trashing Hillary) in the far-right/fascist subsection of the blogosphere, but really.....I try to avoid those sites.]<br /><br />Is everyone to the left of Michelle Malkin really <em>that </em>afraid of critiquing Mrs. Clinton? Is Hillary <em>that</em> sacred of a cow that we dare not--more than peripherally/perfunctorily mentioning her faults--dwell with <em>macaca-level obsessive bloggage</em> on Senator Clinton's seriously suspicious political maneuvers?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/22/AR2006082201161.html">Re-read the WaPo article</a>. Decide for yourself.<br /><br /><strong>***Speaking of WaPo, let's talk about WaPo's </strong><em><strong>Express</strong> </em>and it's "Local Blog Log." <a href="http://www.readexpress.com/read_freeride/2006/08/local_blog_log_dc_curfew_commentary.php">LBL <em>finally </em>corrected both the blog name and gender of a local blogger</a>. DC-area blogger, joelogon (as in josephlogon), has a blog named "Dumb Things I've Done Lately." LBL initially called joelogon a she and called his blog "Bad Things I've Done Lately." Then, LBL corrected the name of joelogon's blog....changing the blog title from "Bad" to "Dumb." Joe, however, was still a she.<br /><br />I just checked the LBL site and it seems--a couple days later--the "she" is now a "he." For those keeping track: Bad is now Dumb, She is now He. <a href="http://www.joelogon.com/blog/2006/08/update-on-my-gender-reassignment.html">Read Mr. joelogon's recap on "Dumb Things I've Done Lately</a>." Somewhat interesting (at least through a haze of CVS-brand Tylenol PM) is that LBL made the changes without ever noting the mistakes.<br /><br /><strong>***Speaking of trannies, I've been saving the image</strong> (above right) of a PETA ad in which Flotilla DeBarge portrays Star Jones "Reynolds" for too long and decided to post it now at all costs.<br /><br /><a href="http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/ps/20050302/110976183102.html">From an old, old, old, old article</a>: "STAR Jones Reynolds is worried that the public won't be able to tell the difference between her and drag queen Flotilla DeBarge. After PAGE SIX revealed that PETA had hired DeBarge to parody the fur-loving Reynolds in a new ad campaign, the corpulent co-host of "The View" sicced her lawyers on the animal-rights organization."<br /><br /><em>Note--thanks go to "M." for reminding me that I forgot to paste/post the best part of the Star Jones/Flotilla DeBarge debacle.<br /></em><br /><a href="http://entertainment.excite.com/celebgossip/pgsixceleb/id/03_03_2005_2.html">From another old, old, old, old article</a>:<br /><blockquote><p>"She wishes her wedding ring looked like this," the drag queen quipped about her golf-ball-sized rock, as she brushed her nails with white polish.<br /><br />The hulking diva has entertained at PETA events before â and she's even played Jones at a birthday party.<br /><br />DeBarge approached the job of channeling Jones with due diligence at the shoot, which featured a white (fake) fur coat with "Fur Is a Drag" spray-painted in red.<br /><br />"Lee Strasberg, Lee Strasberg, Lee Strasberg," she muttered at one point, summoning the legendary Method acting coach.<br /><br />She even showed a few flashes of Jones-like divadom, snapping at a PETA assistant who held a mirror she requested at an unmanageable angle.<br /><br />DeBarge said the ad was not designed to be insulting to Jones, and said she thinks the public won't have any trouble keeping the two straight.<br /><br />"I think people know I'm not Star Jones and she's not me," she said. "She better not be." </p><p><strong>For one thing, DeBarge would never wear fur. "I have a lovely acrylic coat at home, that no acrylics had to die for," she said.</strong> </p></blockquote>
