<div>Okay, I railed on party insiders in Indiana enough for awhile.  Maybe I was a bit harsh, however, drastic actions (i.e. losing all the way down the ballot) sometimes require a drastic response.  Anyway, the series of articles is at its end and I hope you enjoyed them. 
<br />
<br />I thought I might speak on why I choose to write this blog anonymously.  I write this blog anonymously because all too often in American society from the classroom to the workplace to even our houses of worship, we are told to accept prevailing opinions and those who do not are often treated as outcasts.  How many times have you seen someone back down or away from a strong statement when it did not meet with his or her audience's approval?  Or perhaps more to the point, how many times have you seen someone rise to the aid of someone with an opposing opinion?
<br />
<br />I think above all this happens in political circles.  In conversations, for example, I have felt out how people feel about Howard Dean, one of my current political idols.  Most people dismiss him as a looney toon.  Why?  Because the entire American media establishment was looking for and eventually did brand him as such.  Far too often in this country, our psyche and ultimately popular held opinions are shaped by the media.  I think "the scream" is part of the Howard Dean mystique.  Mystique meaning his ability to connect with the rest of us.  This is not a man who has spent his entire career grooming himself to be president.  He is neither a creature of Washington nor political circles, which unfortuneately have an increasingly tight stranglehold on the upper eschelons of the Democratic Party.   I want someone I can relate to, and that's Howard Dean.  I want to see more Howard Deans, real people being real, running the Democratic Party and the state and national parties.
<br />
<br />I grow increasingly disenchanted of the media mills and out-of-touch Washington consultants who filter far too much humanity out of modern federal candidates.  Why did Democrats do so well in state legislatures (*outside of Indiana)?  Simply put, they ran scruffy, hard-nosed campaigns, which because of a lack of funds, kept their money largely at the local level.  In turn local consultants and politicos joined forces with these candidates to a great deal of success.  From Michigan to Montana to Colorado, down ballot state legislative candidates did what Democrats higher on the ballot could not: remain in sync and accountable to local people.  The Washington political boutiques were focused on the presidential, senatorial, and congressional races.  I am so proud of local Democratic candidates.  I only hope, as they climb their respective political ladders, they will continue to use local consultants as well as remain accountable to the folks at home. 
<br />
<br />I think these successes foreshaw coming elections for the Democratic Party.  While the Party as a whole seems rather shattered right now, we can remain hopeful because of our local successes.  As a Party, I think the Democrats have spent too much time on federal office and federal candidates.  If we focus on school boards, county boards, state representative and senate races, I believe our federal offices will take care of themselves in terms of quality candidates rising out of the ranks.  Some of our best federal officeholders are those who took the time and energy to earn their stripes on the local level.  From Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), who began her public career as a County Supervisor in San Francisco to Rep. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) who started off her public career on the County Board in Dane County, some of the Democratic Party's best and brightest stars began on the local level.  While we will always have aberrations, like Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), who defy conventional political wisdom, they are the exception and not the rule.  As a Party, the Democrats must look closer to the rule instead of grasping for exceptions.
<br />
<br />So more than anything, as a Party, Democrats must rebuild on the local level.  Instead of ceding large portions of red state America on the local level to Republicans, there the battle must begin.  Only when we elect local Democrats at the county level in Kansas and Utah, will we not only be able to begin to rebuild the party, we will have a stable of candidates and their accompanying ground organizations to be able to legitimately run nationwide campaigns.  Grassroots, local officials are how the Republican Party rose from being a laughingstock to laughing all the way to the bank in the past election.  If we had a time machine, and I took it back to 1986 for example, and told members of the Democratic Party they would lose control of Congress and the majority of state legislatures, I would be laughed at it.  At that time, the Democratic Party was seen as the folks around the corner instead of the folks associating with "those people."  Insert any minority group you like for "those people." 
<br />
<br />We have been pigeon-holed, we have been painted, and now we have been fit to be tied.  We bottomed out in 2004, so I encourage everyone reading this to run for a local office, volunteer at your local party office, or find some way to work in the grassroots level.  Take the frustration from the last election and put it to work by working on the causes you believe in at the local level.  For too long the Democratic Party was flying without a net, the net being the grassroots.  Now is the time to make a new net, for only then can we begin to run and win credible campaigns for higher office.
