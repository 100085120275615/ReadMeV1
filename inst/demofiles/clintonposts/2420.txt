<span>These are difficult and confusing times. Difficult for me, and confusing for you. As always, I bear the difficult burden of educating and enlightening. And you, Dear Reader, are confused because you see me (correctly) as a Progressive, and yetâ¦and yetâ¦why do these conservatives speak like me?<p></p>

<span>For instance, here is one âJustin Raimondoâ of the wonderfully-named</span>
<span> <a href="http://antiwar.com/justin/">Antiwar.com</a>, who apparently read my yesterday's entry about the Rape of Beirut, and recycled it! (Good for him, recycling â although the cigarette has got to go.):<p></p>

<span>Yes, Mr. Buchanan raises a good question, but is clearly too stupid to know the answer. So I will tell him the answer. (And I know that he reads this blog because itâs where he steals his only good ideas from.)</span>

<span>They hate us, you idiot, because âweâ (as in âAmerikkkansâ) do not give our citizens decent health insurance, we permit Wal-Mart to operate with impunity, and we have still not paid our debt in slavery reparations. If I hate Amerikkka for those reasons (and plenty more), then why should it be so difficult to grasp that the caring beings of the Middle East also hate Amerikkka for those very reasons. <p></p>

<span>Understand this: Hezbollah <a href="http://www.voanews.com/specialenglish/2006-07-21-voa2.cfm">provides social services</a>, and Bush has <span>obliterated </span>social services. Therefore, Bush is our enemy, and Hezbollah is our friend. <p></p>
