<div>Think about it -
<br />
<br />Hillary Clinton, John Kerry, John McCain, and Rudy Giuliani seem to be the very-early front runners. If the 08 <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/2008.htm">election</a> were tomorrow (I have to get a life) John McCain would probably be President.
<br />
<br />For the Republicans -
<br />
<br />I believe Giuliani can out "debate" McCain - he's more composed. McCain tends to be unpredictable and somewhat "touchy" at times. Bush used these characteristics to his advantage when he defeated McCain in 2000. However, Giuliani may have some exploitable ghosts in his closet and McCain has ran the primary route once before. Plus, McCain has gone a long way in the last couple years to nurture his Republican support - that dwindled somewhat after he lost to Bush in 2000. Finally, McCain seems to be ahead of Giuliani in most polling. For now, advantage to McCain.
<br />
<br />For the Democrats -
<br />
<br />Hillary Clinton would be tough for Kerry to beat. H. Clinton is popular and she would have the help of her husband and his network of political masterminds. Kerry's got a war chest and a substantial advantage with respect to experience. Plus, the consensus seems to be that Kerry exited the 2004 stage with grace and dignity - very important for future presidential bids. This is a big reason why Gore is a virtual non-issue...ever. O.k., so lets say advantage to Kerry.
<br />What does it mean:
<br />
<br />McCain v Kerry
<br />
<br />These guys are friends - and these would be interesting debates to watch (maybe). I am not currently endorsing either candidate (obviously never endorsing Kerry), but I think its worth recognizing the profound impact this match-up could have on the otherwise "nasty" nature of Presidential politics.
<br />
<br />This is a far cry from once being considered potential running mates...
