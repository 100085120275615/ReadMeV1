<div>"Gentlemen, he's back." - Kent, from 'Hot Shots'<br />
<br />So I have been away from this thing for a while and I have to tell you I have truly been missing the blog world and all of its procrastinating and self-depracating futility. For the past month I have completed my tenure at LSU, moved to Salinas, CA and started my first "real" job at the newspaper here, The Californian, as a copyeditor and page designer. It's fun, new, exciting, yada yada yada.. that's not what I really want to talk about here. I'm looking to do a state-of-the-world type post. So, indulge me, if you haven't eaten in the last couple of hours.<br />
<br />1) As the title of this post would suggest, yes, I have seen "Superman Returns," and yes, I did rather enjoy it. The story is somewhat tedious and not very exciting or dramatic, and the movie is incredibly long. After seeing the previews I thought the computer animation and special effects was going to ruin some of the charm of the original 1978 Chris Reeve's "Superman," but it was pretty well done a quite believable (about as much as a man who can fly can be) As Lex Luther, Kevin Spacey shouldn't be allowed to sit at the same bus stop as Gene Hackman, he reminds me more of Dr. Evil -- withouth the hilarity or ingenuity. Brandon Routh is decent as Superman and pretty dead-on as Clark Kent, but Reeve is by far the better actor. Lois Lane should have been recast for someone besides Kate Bosworth, she just didn't have it. As for the whole "Truth, Justice and All That Stuff" replacing the original "Truth, Justice and The American Way," it seems the most interesting take on this is that Hollywood doesn't to believe "The American Way" is as marketable to foreign audience's as "All That Stuff." This is most likely because The American Way has become synonymous with Marines killing civilians, illegal domestic spying in multiple forms, the average American's obtuse obsession with American Idol when we are fighting the most unpopular war in five decades, and.. oh yeah, Guantanamo anyone? I don't blame Hollywood for selling out America. The Bush administration did that a long time ago.<br />
<br />2) I'm both pissed at and in admiration of the media recently. Yes, the NY Times/LA Times/Washington Post stories about the government's SWIFT bank tracking operation was good, legal, worthy, and all that stuff, and TV news is finally getting away from the shock and awe to grab ratings spiel it's been on for a few years and getting back to some real broadcast journalism (save that whole Katie Couric thing), but because of idiotic Congressional legislation like banning flag desecration and gay marriage, the media has severly underplayed the fact that Israel has proceeded to ignore international standards for diplomacy by invading Gaza and KIDNAPPING 80 MEMBERS OF HAMAS, which governs a SOVEREIGN NATION! Is it just me or is this a worth a little more than a one-column brief on the inside nation/world section? The media would be wise to forgoe the Star Jones/Barbara Walters war and look at what is really going on in the world. I know newspapers and TV stations can't cover everything, but replacing any and all celebrity news with stories about the upcoming Congolese elections (the first of a democratic nature in about 40 years, Fidel Castro's impending death and its possible implications, or the raping and murdering going on in Darfur and all around Africa, would more serve the public. The public, fuck, don't get me started on them. Moving on..<br />
<br />3) Along with Ann Coulter, San Franciso radio talkshow host Melanie Morgan, who often appears on MSNBC and Fox News, is the most insane white, female, right-wing conservative to roam the earth. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-sargent/right-wing-talk-show-host_b_24125.html">HERE</a> is what she said about the aforementioned NY Times story and editor Bill Keller. She's a lunatic. And she actually has her OWN medium in which she gets to operate. Don't ask me why she is based out of a liberal utopia like San Francisco.<br />
<br />4) As expected, the Democrats can't capitalize on the plethora of debacles GOP politicians lay at their feet every week. Liberals just can't seem to find a common ground or central stance on any of the important or even the superficially relevant issues: immigration - some support amnesty, some don't, none are jumping on the "secure borders" stance like they should be, the war in Iraq - some call for immediate withdrawal, some call for drawdown within a year, 16 months, etc., some say ambivalent things like "I do not think it is a smart strategy for the president to continue with his open-ended commitment, which I think does not put enough pressure on the new Iraqi government, nor do I think it is smart strategy to set a date certain." This quoted directly from Hillary Clinton. It is meandering and fence-riding like this that will grant Republicans another victory this November and in 2008 if Dems don't pull their heads out and realize the American people don't want the perfect answer, they just want a defined and consistent one that isn't coming from a socialist, mediocre-at-best senator from New York .. which is why Hillary will never be president. (My early predictions for Nov. and 2008: Dems win Senate, split the House this fall, Joe Biden runs against Bill Frist in 2008.. Biden wins by a hair.) p.s. - that's bunch of shit.<br />
<br />5) I never got around to posting about the trip I took to Italy in April. So here it goes: it was fun, new, exciting, etc., I saw a bunch of old stuff, foreigners smell bad, I ate a bunch of pasta, it was kind of like "A Farewell to Arms," but with better weather and a happier ending. Okay, enough of this.<br />Graci. Prego.<br />
<br />So, that's about it for my not-so-triumphant return. If you need to get a hold of me I'll be sitting here in my red cape, wishing I could actually do something to spread some truth, justice and all that stuff.<br />
<br />Ciao.</div>
