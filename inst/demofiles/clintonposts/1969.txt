<br />This is probably my shortest headlines, and took me the longest to write. I told y'all I'd be back sometime around Thanksgiving, and I really tried to be, but stuff came up. These headlines are from old news, but...hope ya laugh before ya berate me. :)<br />
<br />Also, this is the first and only time I'm not adding links to my blogbrothers and fellow headliners, because I'm a little bewildered and rusty at the moment. I am "back", just gimme a day or two to get my brain in gear again. ;)</div>
