	<p>The FDA has partially reversed its prior decision and allowed the "morning after pill" to be dispensed without prescription to women 18 years of age or older.</p>
	<p>This follows a disgusting triumph of politics over reason and mission, when the FDA abandoned all prior precedent, ignored evidence, and banned the pill to pander to the religious right.  </p>
	<p>It was one of the few times I agreed with Hillary Clinton: the current "interim" head of the FDA deserved to be blocked from being confirmed as the new Commissioner.  The mission of the FDA is to follow the evidence, not to follow the politics of the party in power.</p>
	<p>The argument from opponents of the pill that it might increase promiscuity is ridiculous. Not only is there no reason to believe that is true, but even if it were, would it not be better to prevent the birth of more unwanted children...especially through a method that works prior to pregnancy?
