Sometimes I just get sick of talking about Bill and Godzillry Clinton.  However, <a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/60414c4c-a95e-11da-a64b-0000779e2340.html">this</a> article was just too good to pass up.   Apparently, at the same time New York Senator Hillary Clinton was denouncing President Bush's insistence to pass the deal that would give control over certain U.S. ports to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), her "husband" former-President Bill Clinton was advising UAE officials in Dubai on how to successfully navigate the public relations nightmare they have in trying to close the deal.  Bill received $300,000 for similar consulting work he did for UAE back in 2002.<br /><br />How typical of the Clintons.  No moral stand, no standing up for what they believe in despite missed financial opportunities--the Clintons only care about one thing--themselves.  For Bill it's how to get as much money as possible no matter who it comes from or what symbolic message it conveys.  For Hillary it's scoring as many political points, preferably against President Bush, for her run for the presidency in 2008.<br /><br />While I'm on the subject, I'd like to weigh in and give my 2cents worth on the port deal.  I think the port deal is stupid.  Let me be clear--I think President Bush is wrong.  Not because I think that giving control of some of our ports to the UAE is really going to jeopardize the secruity of the United States, but because President Bush and his advisors should have known that this deal would stir up unfavorable reactions from the American people and in particular people in President Bush's own party.  Why fight this battle when there are hundreds, if not thousands, of other problems that President Bush could spend his political capital on?  Bush doesn't want to look weak by backing down to the opposition, but it's too late now.  He needs to find the best way to back out of this deal and move on to something that actually matters.
