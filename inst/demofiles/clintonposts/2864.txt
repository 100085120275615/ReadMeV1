<div>A. Yasmine Ressam <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-rassam23aug23,0,599452,print.story?coll=la-opinion-center">doesn't much like Iran:</a>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>IF THE ANTIWAR CROWD and Democrats have their way, the United States will be Iran's hostage once again. An immediate pullout from Iraq would be a victory for Iran, a regime that has declared its ambitions to wipe Israel off the map and establish a caliphate throughout the Middle East. If we allow democracy to be defeated in Iraq, it will only get harder to release Iraq and perhaps the greater Middle East from the grip of its would-be rulers in Tehran.<br />
<br />[...]<br />
<br />Decades ago, the United States underestimated the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's appeal to the Iranian masses and his ability to convert the latent hostility to modernism into political clout. Khomeini overthrew the shah and took more than 50 Americans hostage, thus delivering a significant blow to U.S. prestige and clout in the Middle East.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />It's curious that Ms. Ressam makes no mention of President Eisenhower's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mossadegh">overthrow of Iran's democratic government in 1953.</a>  That event, y'know, led to Khomeini, the 1979-81 hostage crisis, and all the other unpleasantness that followed.  But I suppose that mentioning that would undercut the "nuke Iran" crowd's argument.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>It makes sense, therefore, that the first line of defense against Iran's ambitions is a stable, democratic Iraq, which would provide a formidable counterbalance to Iran. A pro-Western Iraq that develops its economic ties throughout the Middle East and beyond would compete over growing markets for oil with Iranian economic interests. More important, a democratic Iraq would be a long-sought beacon for the oppressed Shiites of the world, an alternative to the appeal of extremist Iran.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />A stable, democratic Iraq would be dandy.  How might we accomplish that, Ms. Ressam?<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. military's presence in Iraq keeps Iran in check. [...]</blockquote>
<br />
<br />Ah, would this be a gentle way to say, "permanent military bases"?<br />
<br />
<blockquote>[...] An immediate pullout, as prescribed by antiwar liberals and demagogic Democrats, would leave Iraq to Iran â and to the likes of Al Qaeda. And that would be a hostage-taking far more harmful to the United States than the one that happened in Tehran nearly 30 years ago.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />Well, it looks like we're just going to have to stay in Iraq forever.  Nevermind that every side in the civil war will be killing our troops; we can just breed more soldiers if we begin to run out.<br />
<br />It's worth noting that Ressam spent hundreds of words to simply say, "stay the course."  As usual, there's no "there there."<br />
<br />It's also worth noting that Ressam works for the Independent Women's Forum.  According to <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Independent_Women's_Forum">Sourcewatch:</a>
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The Independent Women's Forum (IWF) is an anti-feminist organization funded by Richard Mellon Scaife, Koch Industries, and other right-wing ideologues. Materials on IWF's site claim, for example, that "the battered women's movement has outlived its useful beginnings."<br />
<br />While claiming to challenge "radical feminists," IWF primarily targets mainstream feminists and feminist organizations, as exemplified by such figures as Hillary Rodham Clinton and such groups as the American Association of University Women.<br />
<br />IWF is a secular counterpart to Religious Right women's groups like Eagle Forum and Concerned Women for America, but these groups often work together. People for the American Way describe IWF as a group that "opposes affirmative action, gender equity programs like Title IX, and the Violence Against Women Act."</blockquote>

<br />Dickie Scaife.  'Nuff said.<br />
