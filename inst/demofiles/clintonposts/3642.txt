<div>There is a bill in the U.S.Senate (S 2590) which would allow you to go online at a single site and see how your taxes are being spent. However, one or more Senators, acting in secrecy, put a hold on the bill and refused to allow it to come up for debate and action.<br />
<br />The bill, introduced by Sens. Coburn of Oklahoma and Obama of Illinois, would create a website database with access to information on almost all federal spending. Just before the annual August recess, the bill was "hotlined". Under a "hotline", a bill passes as long as nobody secretly objects to its passage. The Coburn/Obama bill did not pass before recess, which means that a secret "hold" was placed on the bill to prevent its passage.<br />
<br />I have no problem with matters such as security or personnel being discussed in secret, but allowing a Senator to secretly hold a bill just doesn't seem the way the Senate should work. If a Senator opposes a bill, he or she should do so publicly and explain why.<br />
<br />Are either of your Senators among those who have secretly blocked this bill?<br />
<br />The bill has a bipartisan list of prominent co-sponsors including: Senate President Bill Frist, R-Tenn., and Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and possible presidential hopefuls Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. The bill was approved July 27 by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.<br />
<br />The House approved a similar measure in June, but its version of the database would include information only on grants. Sponsors in the Senate are working with House members to iron out this difference.<br />
