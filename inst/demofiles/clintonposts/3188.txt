<div>I normally blog about the latest news as it relates to abortion, life issues and politics.  Today's news has several stories worthy of comment, including but not limited to Hillary Clinton's warm words about pro-lifers (how do you spell disingenuous again?), the pro-life rally in Washington DC commemorating the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and its lack of coverage in the MSM, and the passage written by Jonathan Rauch in the latest issue of The Atlantic where he compares pro-lifers (all of us) to clinic bombers.
<br />
<br />But not today.  Today my topic is cynicism.
<br />
<br />In a nut shell, it's a sin and I'm against it.
<br />
<br />Merriam Webster says a cynical person is one having a sneering disbelief in sincerity or integrity.
<br />
<br />I see cynics every day.  
<br />
<br />At work, they are always attributing anything they don't like to some sinister evil directing the organization.  Someone doesn't like them, or doesn't understand their job, or doesn't support them in their work, or doesn't pay them enough, or has it easy and is living the high life laughing at the poor paeans who working the trenches.
<br />
<br />Now, I'm sure there are organizations like that--evil people heading up evil companies who hate their employees and treat them like dirt.  It's just that I don't know any.
<br />
<br />I was a boss for 22 years.  My partners and I agonized over treating our employees fairly and providing them an appropriate wage and a good working environment.  I know other CEO's and bosses who felt the same way.  
<br />
<br />I know of no employees who worked harder or longer hours...than the boss.  
<br />
<br />I'll never forget listening to a nurse at my former hospital complain about the administration and how mean, vindictive and manipulative they were.  I also personally knew the all the members of the administration.  They were smart, hard-working, kind, fair, dedicated people who would never cheat or treat someone in a dishonest way.  I'd like to say that it was just a case of misunderstanding, but it wasn't.  It didn't matter what she heard about them, if it didn't fit her warped view of them, she wouldn't believe it.  It was a choice that she deliberately made.
<br />
<br />She was a cynic.  It was depressing just being around her.
<br />
<br />I've seen cynics in school.  Having been a student for the first thirty years of my life, I've seen plenty of cynical students.  To them, the teachers were never fair.  The questions were always trick questions.  The assignments were always unreasonable.  If you hung around them long enough, they drug you down.  Their attitude was contagious.
<br />
<br />I've seen cynics in all walks of life.  
<br />
<br />The cynic is the spectator, the Monday morning quarterback of life.  The cynic doesn't "do" as much as he criticizes those who "do".  The word "enthusiasm" is not in the cynics vocabulary.  
<br />
<br />The problem is, our society thinks it's cool.  It's the rebel, the cynic, who is the anti-hero in the movies.  Our young people see that and try to emulate them which isn't hard.  Being a cynic is so easy.
<br />
<br />But that's the way it is with most sin.  Easy.  
<br />
<br />Can you love someone and be a cynic?  Can you care about someone's soul and be a cynic?  Does a cynic model courage?  Perseverance?  Prudence?  Faith?  Hope?  Love?  Humility?
<br />
<br />No, of course not.
<br />
<br />My prayer is this:  God, help me leave cynicism at the foot of the cross.  I hope it's your prayer, too.</div>
