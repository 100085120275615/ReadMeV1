<a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/">Rightwing News</a> had a <a href="http://www.rightwingnews.com/archives/week_2005_02_13.PHP#003476">nice post</a> defending Blogs against Kathleen Parker's <a href="http://www.townhall.com/columnists/kathleenparker/kp20050216.shtml">opinion piece</a> on how blogs don't respect "off the record" remarks. Kathleen seems to be taking up the MSM dissembling on Easongate (how Jordan's comments must have been "off the record" when event moderator David Gergen said the opposite, or how Jordan only said that coalition military may have mis-identified journalists as enemy combatants and killed them -- when Jordan's words were that the US military was intentionally targeting persons they knew to be journalists for torture and killing).<br />
<br />As relayed by RWN:<br />

<i>"Some take it to mean Âbetween usÂ or Âuse with discretion.Â Jesse Jackson thought he was Âoff-the-recordÂ when he referred to New York City as ÂHymietown.Â Ronald Reagan thought he was Âoff-the-recordÂ when he referred to White House reporters as Âsons of b*tches.Â Newt GingrichÂs mother thought she was Âoff-the-recordÂ when she disparaged Hillary Clinton on network television."</i> </p>     <p>So maybe "off-the-record" officially died after "Easongate," but it has been on life support for decades at least and the truth is the plug should have been pulled long ago.</p> </blockquote> <p> </p> So this morning when you'd think a man's private telephone conversations with a friend was "off the record," ABC's Good Morning America replays Georgia W. telephone conversations that were taped unbeknownst to him. This is the same program that ripped radio counselor Dr. Laura for having been estranged from her mother when news broke that her mother had been brutally murdered.<br />
<br />So MSM, we hope you'll forgive us bloggers if we are reluctant to embrace your lectures on journalistic hygiene.</div>
