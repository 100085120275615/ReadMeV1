<p>There&rsquo;s got to be a morning after . . . pill, that is.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are an acting director of the FDA awaiting Senate confirmation, a radical feminist at NOW or Planned Parenthood, or a statutory rapist who loves to prey on young girls, today is your day.</p>
<p>It is hard to believe that President Bush, a former Texas governor who once ran on a platform as a moral conservative, could utter the following statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I believe that Plan B ought to be &ndash; ought to require a prescription for minors, is what I believe.&nbsp; And I support Andy&rsquo;s decision.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But utter he did.&nbsp; That was the President&rsquo;s response when asked by a reporter how he feels about the ludicrous decision, and how he feels about Plan B emergency contraception in general.&nbsp; Washington changes everything.</p>
<p>If President Bush believes there will be no repercussions with his conservative base, he is mistaken.&nbsp;&nbsp; A prominent pro-life leader issued a <a href="http://www.hli.org/press_releases_withdraw_von_eschenbach.html">press release</a> asking President Bush to withdraw Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach&rsquo;s nomination.&nbsp; The Family Research Council is planning a legal challenge to the FDA decision.&nbsp; With mid-term elections so close, the fallout will be against the Republicans if outraged voters in the pro-life base stay home.</p>
<p>With the FDA&rsquo;s approval of this high-voltage cocktail of hormones, any adult over the age of 18 will have free access to Plan B pills over the counter.&nbsp; That includes adult women and <em>adult men</em>.&nbsp; The decision does not differentiate between the sexes.&nbsp; Predatory males will obtain the pills and give them to minors.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s open season on underage girls.&nbsp; This is remarkable considering there is strong evidence that Planned Parenthood (which will now become the &ldquo;counter of choice,&rdquo; in the words of their press release) protects pedophiles that bring girls to their abortion mills.&nbsp; All the abortion employees have to do is dispense the pills to the predators.&nbsp; The girls don&rsquo;t even need to come to their clinics.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an easy, simple and safe solution for Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>The FDA&rsquo;s decision is not a surprise; it&rsquo;s an extension of their previous action legalizing mifepristone (RU-486).&nbsp; Pro-abortion Senator Barbara Boxer (D-CA) penned a letter in which she applied pressure on the FDA to have mifepristone approved.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; Now, radical pro-abortion Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) and Patty Murray (D-WA) flexed their feminist muscles, refusing to allow President Bush&rsquo;s nomination of Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach to go forward unless Plan B was approved.</p>
<p>Whether Plan B simply prevents ovulation, stops implantation or is an actual abortion is not the critical issue.&nbsp; The media spin that pro-lifers are opposed to Plan B because &ldquo;it causes an abortion&rdquo; misses the point.&nbsp; To do its job, the hormone levels contained in this drug&rsquo;s mix are high; much higher than standard birth control pills that require a doctor&rsquo;s prescription.&nbsp; There are no empirical studies indicating such levels are safe in young women, especially in adolescents whose bodies and hormones are developing.</p>
<p>Important also is that young adults have more sex when it becomes easier and more convenient to do so.&nbsp; Plan B will cause young women (and minors who get the pills covertly) to be careless and promiscuous.&nbsp; Plan B does not protect against sexually transmitted diseases.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expect more STD&rsquo;s in the future, especially among college-age kids.&nbsp; STD&rsquo;s have reached alarming levels in England, where the drug is readily available.&nbsp; Pro-aborts say Plan B will dramatically lower the abortion rate.&nbsp; Not so.&nbsp; In European countries where the drug has been available over-the-counter, abortions have increased as have unplanned pregnancies.</p>
<p>This writer has argued for years that no amount of abortion will ever satisfy the radical contingent on the far left.&nbsp; Observe the following lines from a press release by the National Organization for Women:&nbsp; &ldquo;But the placement 'behind the counter' still means that even an adult woman may have to contend with a moralizing lecture from the cashier or pharmacy clerk, and deal with the same kinds of refusals that now face women trying to fill a prescription.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are there no feminist pharmacists?&nbsp; Planned Parenthood should fill the void.&nbsp; They can establish a &ldquo;Feminist University,&rdquo; (F.U. for short) offering choice training.&nbsp; Graduates must pass reproductive rights exams to be placed at &lsquo;choice pharmacies&rsquo; across America.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can see a future where a pubescent adolescent girl approaches a choice counter, gets ambushed by a brazen activist who quickly slips packets of Plan B under the counter whispering, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t tell anybody, honey, if you won&rsquo;t!&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be plenty of abuse, and young teens will be the victims.&nbsp; The NOW press release says the FDA decision &ldquo;leaves young women vulnerable.&rdquo;&nbsp; That&rsquo;s true.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not to be a morning after . . . not for young women or girls desperately needing guidance, enlightenment and truth.&nbsp; They won&rsquo;t be told about the high levels of hormones, the&nbsp;lack&nbsp;of STD protection or that engaging in sex with multiple partners increases the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease.&nbsp; Rather, they&rsquo;ll face darkness and deception by slick abortion operators who apply exploitation for profit.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s perverse, and despite the Family Research Council&rsquo;s well-intentioned legal challenge against the FDA, the decision will prevail.</p>
