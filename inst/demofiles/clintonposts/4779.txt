<p>The Gallup Organization polled 1,004 adults, including 406 Republicans and Republican leaners who are registered to vote, and found that 27% of registered voters support Rudy Giuliani and 24% back Sen. John McCain. Dr. Condoleezza "Rice is the choice of 19% of Republican registered voters. The remaining Republicans tested in the poll are all in single digits, including Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist of Tennessee (9%), Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney (4%), New York Governor George Pataki (3%), Virginia Sen. George Allen (3%), and Kansas Sen. Sam Brownback (2%). Less than 1% chose Nebraska Sen. Chuck Hagel."</p>

<blockquote>A new CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll finds New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton as the clear early favorite of the Democratic Party's rank-and-file for the 2008 presidential nomination. On the Republican side, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and Arizona Sen. John McCain are closely matched, with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice coming in third. Majorities of Americans view Clinton as a strong and decisive leader, as likeable, and as caring and honest. However, Americans are more inclined to believe she would divide rather than unite the country, and less than half believe she shares their values.

<p>The August 5-7 poll asked Democrats and Republicans who they are most likely to support in the 2008 presidential primaries. Clinton has a sizeable lead over the rest of the Democratic field, as 40% of Democratic registered voters prefer her to other possible nominees. Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards are the closet pursuers, at just 16% and 15%, respectively. Nine percent favor Delaware Sen. Joe Biden, while 5% or less currently support retired general Wesley Clark (5%), New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson (3%), Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh (3%), and Virginia Governor Mark Warner (2%). </blockquote><br />
