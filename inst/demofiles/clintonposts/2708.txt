<div><p>From a reader:</p>

<div><p>The Louisville-Jefferson County Democratic Executive Committee held its regular monthly meeting last night.&nbsp; On the proposed agenda which had been mailed out to the committee was an item providing that State Party Chair Jerry Lundergan was to remit to the LJCDP a check for $6,000.00 representing the Party's share of the Hillary Clinton proceeds.&nbsp; No check was presented nor was any explanation offered for the State chair's absence.</p></div>

<p>I'm shocked! <strong>Kentucky Democratic Party Chairman Jerry Lundergan</strong> not living up to financial promises? </p>

<p>Could it be because the state party is broke?</p></div>
