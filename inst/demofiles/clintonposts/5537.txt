Part II<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Cedars of Arlington<br /><br /> <br /><br />In 1976, the Fellowship began looking for a permanent headquarters in Arlington. It set its sights on the estate of George Mason IV, The Cedars, located at 2301 North Uhle Street.  Mason was one of the drafters of the Bill of Rights. The Fellowship, also known as the International Foundation, bought the property from Charles Piluso. Although not much is known about Piluso, the Los Angeles Times reported that Howard Hughes, the man with whom Fellowship Senator Ralph Owen Brewster once sparred, also lived there. According to a senior Pentagon official, the Cedars had been used as a CIA safe house prior to the Fellowshipâs purchase of the estate. The Fellowship paid $1.5 million for the Cedars, the money coming from Tom Phillips, the CEO of Raytheon, and Ken Olsen, the CEO of Digital Equipment Corporation. Sanford McDonnell of McDonnell Douglas Corporation was another deep-pocketed supporter of the Fellowship through Full Gospel Business Menâs Fellowship International, an activity linked to Fellowship core member Pat Robertson. <br /><br /> <br /><br />According to the Los Angeles Times, other wealthy contributors to the Fellowship and its adjunct International Foundation include Republican donor Michael Timmis, a conservative Catholic Detroit lawyer who replaced Colson as chairman of Prison Fellowship International (Colson remained as Chairman Emeritus) and who also served on the board of the Promise Keepers, another evangelical group; Jerome A. Lewis, the Denver-based oilman who is chairman of Petro-Lewis, one of the largest oil and natural gas partnership firms in the world; and Maryland oilman Paul N. Temple. The Fellowship has also received support from the Eli Lilly and Pew Foundations, contributors to a number of right-wing causes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In 1991, according to the New York Times, Fellowship member Mark Hatfield came under a Senate ethics investigation and a Federal grand jury probe after he made $300,000 from real estate deals since 1981 involving the sale and purchase of properties from Temple. The investigation of Hatfield followed years of reports that he had received additional largesse from the Fellowship in loans and other favors. It should be noted that Hatfieldâs son, Mark Hatfield, is currently the Director of Communications for the Department of Homeland Security. The Fellowship and its members know good real estate deals when they see them. For example, the Cedars is now valued at $4.4 million â and Arlington County received zero in taxes from it because it is tax-exempts a âchurch.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />A letter from the Fellowship Foundationâs lawyers, Barman, Radigan, Suiters & Brown, to Van Caffo, Zoning Administrator for Arlington County, dated September 9, 1976, requested permission to house âovernight guestsâ at the Fellowshipâs recently-purchased estate, known as âThe Cedars.â The letter stated, âno more than ten individuals could be accommodated at any one time.â The letter also affirmed, âthat no [emphasis in original] person not involved in the Fellowship would ever be invited to spend the night at the House.â That statement would later prove embarrassing to a number of politicians who stayed at Fellowship group homes while insisting they were not members of the group.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Fellowshipâs attorneys stressed that âanyone staying at the House will have prior involvement with the activities of Fellowship Foundation.â The letter continued, âAccording to Mr. Coe, these individuals fall into two main categories:<br /><br /> <br /><br />1.    Those who come to the Washington area for the sole [emphasis in original] purpose of participating in the worship activities of Fellowship Foundation. I understand that you have no problem with this category.<br /><br />2.    Those who come to the Washington area for a dual purpose, one of which is participation in the worship activities of Fellowship Foundation. It is this category of individuals, which apparently gives you pause.â <br /><br /> <br /><br />For Arlington County, the mere presence of yet another right-wing group, in addition to the Nazis who had already given the county a black eye in the national media, was more than reason to be concerned. However, the Fellowshipâs attorneys, using double-speak, convinced the Arlington authorities to grant the group the necessary permits. The Fellowshipâs attorneys also made it clear that âthe Foundation works quietly but extremely effectively in accomplishing its singular purpose.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />A letter from Arlington Countyâs Department of Inspection Services to Coeâs attorneys, dated September 20, 1976, granted the Fellowship use of the Cedars as a âplace of worship.â The Fellowship would provide more than just a place of worship at the Cedars. The estate would become the site for international intrigue and charges from neighbors that troubled young people staying at the home were being subjected to mind control.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In 1984, the Fellowship achieved a record at its National Prayer Breakfast. The 34th such gathering attracted representatives from over 100 nations. Similar prayer breakfasts were held in over 500 American cities. Conservative politicians were being tapped as never before for future service to the goals of the Fellowship and its affiliates. Moreover, the Christian fundamentalists were gaining influence in the media. Pat Robertsonâs 700 Club began the Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN), which cleverly combined news broadcasts with religious programming. In 1983, Moon started the Washington Times, a paper that was built on the remains of the William F. Buckleyâs defunct Washington Evening Star. Ronald Reagan called the money-losing Washington Times his favorite newspaper. It did not matter that Moon was named as a central player in the Koreagate scandal that rocked Washington politics from 1976 to 1978. Moon, an operative named Bo Hi Pak (who was president of the Washington Times), and the Korean Central Intelligence Agency were accused of bribing politicians. Fordâs Vice Presidential running mate in 1976, Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, was one of those who called for a full investigation of Moon. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Representative Donald Fraser (D-MN) launched a House investigation of the Korean political influence peddler. Fraserâs committee concluded that Moon was a central to an âinternational network of organizations engaged in economic and political activitiesâ and that Moonâs organization âhad systematically violated U.S. tax, immigration, banking, currency, and Foreign Agents Registration Act laws.â The New York Daily Newsâ Lars Erik Nelson called for the Justice Department to investigate the Washington Times for violation of the Foreign Agentsâ Registration Act. The Fraser Report also proved the connection between Moon and the Korean CIA. For his efforts, Moonâs propaganda machine branded Fraser an âagent of Moscowâ and began a vicious character assassination campaign against him. Undaunted, Fraser went on to become Mayor of Minneapolis. But for the Christian Right, Moonâs personal attack template would serve as a blueprint for future Christian fundamentalist candidates. One recommendation of the Fraser Committee went unheeded by the incoming Reagan administration: a White House Task Force to investigate Moon and his operations. George H. W. Bushâs hat trick with the Iranian hostage takers ensured that Moon would not have to worry about White House interference. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Nor did it matter that U.S. counter-narcotics investigators were uncovering evidence that Moon supplemented his various enterprises around the world with money from drugs from Latin America and Asia â proceeds that partially wound up in the coffers of Jerry Falwell. The Fascist thread that Moon inherited from Buchmanâs Moral Rearmament was evident in one of Moonâs richest supporters, Ryoichi Sasakawa, one of Japanâs richest businessmen and a self-described âfascist.â According to PBSâs Frontline, Sasakawa, who met Benito Mussolini in 1939 and called him the perfect âfascist,â was imprisoned by U.S. forces after World War II as a war criminal. In 1967, Sasakawa and Moon formed the Japanese chapter of the right-wing World Anti Communist League, a right-wing group that would help Moon gain an entrÃ©e to Latin American military dictators and other right-wing groups around the world. It was the same network that was used by the Fellowship Foundation and World Vision. Moon and Sasakawa were also connected to the Japanese âYakuza,â the Mafia that controlled gambling and the illegal narcotics market in the country. <br /><br /> <br /><br />But while he thought he had a free pass from Reagan and the conservatives in his administration, Moon miscalculated the IRS and its enforcement of tax laws. In 1982, Moon was convicted in a federal court for income tax evasion. He was sentenced to 13 months imprisonment at the Danbury Federal Correctional Facility in Connecticut. Immediately, Falwell called for a presidential pardon from Reagan. The pardon initiative for Moon was championed by former Senator Paul Laxalt (R-NV) and Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT). When Fellowship core member Richard Thornburgh, the former Governor of Pennsylvania, became Attorney General under George H. W. Bush, the Fellowship network no longer had to worry about running afoul of tax laws. Thornburgh would later serve on a committee that investigated CBS anchor Dan Rather and 60 Minutes for their use of Texas Air National Guard documents that pointed to George W. Bushâs absent without leave (AWOL) status in 1972. The original documents had been scanned thus giving them the appearance of being forged. However, 60 Minutes, which had exposed past government, business, and religious wrongdoing, had been largely neutered and Rather announced his retirement. One former Justice Department Criminal Division attorney said he was not surprised to hear that former Attorneys General Ed Meese, Thornburgh, and John Ashcroft were core members of the Fellowship. He said they were âthe three worst Attorneys General my division ever worked for.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />One other prominent Christian reconstructionist member of Reaganâs cabinet was Interior Secretary James Watt. He actually once told a congressional panel that the environment was not important in light of the imminent return of Jesus. Under oath, he told a congressional committee that believed that Jesus would return âafter the last tree is felled.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />At the same time Moon was on his rise, another Christian dominionist began to put his stamp on Republican right-wing policies. His name was Rousas John Rushdoony, the son of Armenian refugees from the anti-Armenian Turkish pogroms of the early 20th century. Rushdoony ran a Christian Right think tank in Los Angeles called the Chalcedon Foundation. Chalcedon became the source for much of the philosophical underpinnings of the Fellowshipâs political platform â a platform that would provide much of the political and religious propaganda spread by Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell on their respective television programs. Robertson had been very much like George W. Bush in his earlier years. The son of Senator A. Willis Robertson (D-VA), Robertson was known as a playboy with a questionable military service record during the Korean War. But like George W. Bush, Robertson âfound God.â Converted by Vereideâs close associate Harold Bredesen who spoke in âtongues.â In a bizarre display, Bredesen reportedly once spoke in ancient Arabic to a wealthy Egyptian heiress during a Fellowship meeting. Robertson, in addition to running his 700 Club television program, decided to invest in diamond mines in Africa. He became close to three of Africaâs most infamous despots â Mobutu Sese Seko and Laurent D. Kabila of Zaire/Congo and Charles Taylor of Liberia. It was discovered that Robertson was using his âOperation Blessingâ aircraft, not to provide aid to African victims of famine, war, and disease, but to transport equipment and supplies for his various diamond mining ventures on the continent. It would not be the only criminal activity engaged in by the Fellowship in Africaâs affairs.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Rushdoony became a Presbyterian minister in California during the mid-1940s, the same time Vereide and Buchman were extending their influence in Washington and around the world. Rushdoonyâs writings attacked the Unitarian religion and what he considered its contrivances, which included the United Nations. He was also an early proponent of home schooling (an important part of the Fellowshipâs agenda) and a charter member of the secretive Council for National Policy (CNP) â a right-wing version of the Council on Foreign Relations whose first head was Christian Right leader Tim LaHaye, the one-time head of the Moon-funded Coalition for Religious Freedom whose advisory board members included such Christian Right luminaries as Don Wildmon, the pro-censorship head of the American Family Association; Pat Crouch, the founder of the Trinity Broadcast Network; and James Kennedy, the televangelist head of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Another important CNP member was Baptist deacon and former Senator Jesse Helms (R-NC), who also championed right-wing fascist Latin American leaders favored and supported by the Fellowship. These included El Salvadorean death squad leaders Roberto dâAubisson and General Carlos Eugenios Vides Casanova (now living in South Florida under the protection of Jeb Bush and the right-wing Cuban community), El Salvadorâs right-wing President Alfredo Cristiani (in 1990, President George H. W. Bush reportedly held a special prayer with Cristiani and death squad leader dâAubisson in a side room at the National Prayer Breakfast with Coe officiating), Honduran evangelical Christian death squad leader General Gustavo Alvarez Martinez, Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, Brazilian dictator Artur da Costa e Silva, Guatemalan dictator and evangelist Efrain Rios Montt (in 2004, Monttâs daughter, Guatemalan Senator Zury Rios Sosa married Fellowship adherent Representative Jerry Weller (R-IL), Guatemalaâs evangelist President Jorge Serrano Elias (his George W. Bush-like quote upon election in 1991: âWe have won the election with the support of the people and God. I have no commitment to any political power base; my only commitment is to God, to whom I've committed myself to govern the best I can`. . .â); and Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio Somoza (also one of Coeâs friends). The Fellowship had been on very good terms with Panamanian dictator and drug runner Manuel Noriega who the first Bush ousted in a 1989 military invasion. Other CNP initiatives included supporting apartheid in South Africa (Jerry Falwell called South Africaâs Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu a âphonyâ and Pat Robertsonâs 700 Club provided a convenient propaganda outlet for South Africaâs apartheid regime) and opposing Corazon Aquinoâs attempt to depose Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The looted gold bullion and gems from the deposed Philippine dictatorâs coffers and other ill-gotten foreign funds would eventually be used to fatten the off-shore Bush bank accounts (artifices with various Bush family corporate code names â Five Star Companies, Lone Star Companies, Phoenix Group, Winston Partners, Cosmos Corporation, Hamilton Trust, InterFirst Bank, European Pacific Group, Mongoose Enterprises, Equity Trust, Interfax Gold Corporation, etc.) and serve as the source for the money used in the future to âfixâ elections in favor of George W. Bush and his political allies.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Rushdoony developed his own network of right-wing fundamentalist Christians, including Oklahoma State Representative Bill Graves, an ardent Christian dominionist, and John Whitehead, the director of the Rutherford Institute, the right-wing outfit funded by Rushdoony that propelled Paula Jones to national stardom as Bill Clintonâs chief accuser and involved itself in the 2000 Florida election recount fiasco on behalf of George W. Bush. Rushdoonyâs son-in-law, Gary North, is a very active Christian dominionist in right-wing politics and the proponent of âChristian economics,â which is based on the Austrian (Fredrich von Hayek) or Mount Pelerin Society schools of economics. The precepts of this economic school are based on Fascist economic theories of the 1920s and 30s. The umbrella organization for Rushdoony and Northâs activities was the William Volker Fund, which also funded the conservative Hoover Institution.<br /><br /> <br /><br />North also founded the Aaron Burr Society. The groupâs emblem has a drawing of Burr shooting Alexander Hamilton in their infamous duel. The emblem bears the motto: âNot soon enough,â referring to the notion that Hamiltonâs assassination should have occurred much sooner.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Fellowship also made inroads within the U.S. military, particularly the officersâ ranks. Through an entity known as the Officers Christian Fellowship (OCF), the Fellowship tapped officers in all the services and future officers in the service academies to become âambassadors for Christ in uniform.â The motto of the OCF is âPray, Discover, Obey.â The Christian Military Fellowship served as the OCFâs counterpart among the enlisted ranks. Adjunct Fellowship organizations targeted foreign officers and enlisted men, particularly in Great Britain and Australia; service spouses; and service mothers. The international military fellowship is known as the Association of Military Christian Fellowships (AMCF). One person close to the AMCF is Arthur E. (âGeneâ) Dewey, a retired Army officer who served as Colin Powellâs Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration. Dewey was also a personal consultant to Douglas Coe. In his State Department position, Dewey was an ardent foe of international family planning programs, including the denial of reproductive health care to refugee women.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Eventually, the Fellowship would count some of the militaryâs top leaders among its members. They include former Joint Chiefs Chairman General David Jones, current Joint Chiefs chairman General Richard Myers, former Marine Corps Commandant and current NATO commander General James L. Jones, Iran-contra figure Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, and, perhaps even more controversial than North, Army Lt. Gen. William âJerryâ Boykin, the military head of Defense Secretary Rumsfeldâs intelligence branch. In 2003, Boykin, in a speech to the First Baptist Church in Daytona Beach, Florida, referred to the United States as a âChristian nationâ and, that in reference to a Somali warlord, he stated, â I knew that my God was bigger than his. I knew that my God was a real God and his was an idol.â The reverberations of Boykinâs comments were felt around the world. But his allies and Fellowship compatriots, Rumsfeld, Myers, Kansas Representative Todd Tiahrt, and most important, George W. Bush, refused to condemn him. Calls for Boykinâs reassignment when unheeded. Soon afterwards, Boykinâs Pentagon intelligence group was discovered to have been involved with the torture and sexual molestation of prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The sexual molestation of prisoners included male and female teens being held in Iraq. Also of note is the current head executive director of the OCF. He is retired Lt. Gen. Bruce Fister, the former head of the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Command.<br /><br /> <br /><br />One of the larger OCF chapters is at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the home of the U.S. militaryâs disciplinary barracks and a prime recruiting and mentoring center for Fellowship members. All sorts of military members who have been sentenced by courts martial around the world have served their prison terms at Leavenworth. In 1982, a key member of the OCF began his four-year sentence at hard labor at Leavenworth after he was convicted of over 19 counts of lewd and lascivious acts with minors, including the dependents of naval personnel under his command. He was Lieutenant Commander Larry W. (Bill) Frawley, Jr., U.S. Naval Academy graduate, P-3 Orion pilot, and the one-time Commanding Officer of the Coos Head, Oregon Naval Facility, a classified Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS) station that mainly monitored Soviet submarines on missile patrol and maneuvers in the Pacific. Frawley was heavily involved in a child pornography ring before FBI agents discovered his name after a major bust of a kiddie porn kingpin in Chicago. The Operations Officer assigned to Coos Head was requested by the Naval Investigative Service and the FBI to set up a âstingâ against Frawley. Duly sworn in as a temporary special agent of the FBI, the Operations Officer gained Frawleyâs trust, gathered incriminating evidence against him, handed it to federal and local law enforcement agents from Coos Bay, Oregon; Portland, and Seattle, and testified as the governmentâs star witness at Frawleyâs court martial at the Navyâs Sand Point Base in Seattle. It was later discovered by NIS and the FBI that Frawley and other members of the OCF used the Christian organization as a cover for their child pornography business. And one other tidbit had been discovered by the FBI. Frawley had traveled secretly to the Soviet Union while he held a Top Secret nuclear weapons and cryptographic security clearance.<br /><br /> <br /><br />That discovery led to the reassignment of the Operations Officer, the Portland-based and Seattle-based NIS agents, and the Coos Bay-based FBI agent to relatively insignificant desk jobs in Washington, DC. While he held his confidence and trust, Frawley revealed to the Operations Officer that those involved with his ring included other top-ranking military officers, lawyers, and members of the clergy. Later, the two NIS agents revealed that the Coos Bay scandal âwent to the very topâ of the Reagan administration. Frawleyâs prison term at Leavenworth was anything but âhard labor.â Navy insiders reported that he attended therapy sessions. If the sessions involved the OCF, it is easy to ascertain how they operated. Jeff Sharletâs Harperâs article provides a unique insight into the Fellowshipâs thinking about sex perverts. Sharlet recounted a discussion Douglas Coeâs son, David, was having with one recruit named Beau at the Ivanwald compound. Coe asked Beau, âBeau, letâs say I hear you raped three little girls. And now here you are at Ivanwald. What would I think of you, Beau?â Embarrassed, Beau replied, âProbably that Iâm pretty bad!â Coe responded, âNo, Beau, I wouldnât. Because Iâm not here to judge you. Thatâs not my job. Iâm here for only one thing.â Beauâs answer was, âJesus!â<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Fellowship certainly did not mind when singer Michael Jackson stayed with his children at the Cedars in October 2001 when he was in Washington for a benefit concert for the 911 victims. In a lawsuit filed in 1993, Jackson was accused of sexually molesting a 13-year-old boy. According to a September 27, 2002 Los Angeles Times article by Lisa Getter, Jacksonâs stay at the Cedars was arranged through David Kuo, George W. Bushâs White House director of the Office of Faith-based Initiatives. Kuo, a former CIA employee who co-wrote a book with Ralph Reed, had been Executive Director of the Center for Effective Compassion, founded in 1995 by Arianna Huffington and Marvin Olasky. Olasky is a Jewish convert to evangelical Christianity, a major Christian reconstructionist proponent, and an ardent supporter of George W. Bush. Kuo also previously worked for the Christian Coalition and Senator John Ashcroft.<br /><br /> <br /><br />After the Navyâs cover-up of the Frawley and other related criminal cases, the Operations Officer used his Washington, DC base to expose the matter to the public. He received warnings from other active duty and retired Navy personnel that his activities were âembarrassingâ to the Navy and that there would be professional and âother consequencesâ if he did not desist.  The cover-up went to the highest echelons of the Navyâs command structure and included Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, the man whose obfuscation abilities would be used to cover-up the gun turret explosion on board the USS Iowa battleship, the tail hook scandal involving naval aviators, and, ultimately, the 911 attacks when he was named as a member of the 911 Commission by George W. Bush. In the interest of full disclosure, it must be stated that this author was the Operations Officer referenced above.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Another organization affiliated with the Fellowship is the Campus Crusade for Christ, which, in turn, runs something called the Christian Embassy, its outreach arm in Washington. There is also an âInternational Christian Embassyâ in Jerusalem that also houses the studios of Pat Robertsonâs Christian Broadcasting Network. Through the Campus Crusade, the Fellowship and its affiliates seek converts among college students in the United States and abroad. An additional Fellowship activity is the National Student Leadership Program and the associated Navigators, which seek converts among college and high school-aged young people. The Fellowshipâs network can also reach out to other evangelicals for the purpose of political marches on Washington. Whether they are called âJesus Marches,â Promise Keeper rallies, or anti-abortion gatherings, the fundamentalists have been able to tap the support of Falwell; Richard Roberts, the son of Oklahoma-based evangelist Oral Roberts; and Florida-based evangelist Benny Hinn. In addition, the Fellowship has its own aggressive âYouth Corps,â which is active seeking converts, according to Jeff Sharletâs Harperâs article, in countries as diverse as Russia, Ukraine, Romania, India, Pakistan, Uganda, Nepal, Bhutan, Ecuador, Honduras, and Peru. The Fellowship seeks to groom young leaders for future positions of leadership in countries around the world. According to Sharlet, the goal of the Fellowship is âtwo hundred national and international world leaders bound together relationally by a mutual love for God and the family.â In Fellowship-speak, the âfamilyâ is synonymous with the Fellowship. The strategy of placing Fellowship âmolesâ in foreign governments would pay off nicely when George W. Bush and his advisers had to cobble together a âCoalition of the Willingâ to support the U.S. invasion of Iraq. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The Christian Right, having cleverly hidden its Nazi and Fascist past, was on the march. The movement would soon tap ambitious conservative politicians eager to use its vast resources to achieve political power. Newt Gingrich, Dennis Hastert, John Ashcroft, Tom DeLay, Dan Quayle --- and, after a concordat with failed 1988 Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson -- George H. W. Bush, would all become followers, some for truly religious reasons, but most for political opportunism. But the biggest prize of all was yet to be heard from. The failed businessman and politician from west Texas, George W. Bush, was now a firm believer in the Fellowship agenda. In his fatherâs 1988 race against Michael Dukakis, the junior Bush was his fatherâs liaison to the fundamentalist right. Junior Bush would help channel advice and money from the Christian Right to his fatherâs campaign. In a sign of things to come, the Bush campaign savaged Michael Dukakis over a convicted murderer and prison parolee in Massachusetts named Willie Horton, who, after he was released from prison, held a Maryland couple hostage, raping the wife and stabbing her husband. The strategy was based on the Bush campaign notion that Dukakis, if elected, would pardon African American prisoners who would rape white women. An attack ad ran on television by a Republican group insinuated that Dukakis would release blacks who would threaten whites. For the junior Bush and the Christian Right, it was a campaign position that would pay off handsomely in the future when dealing with John McCain and John Kerry. One of the architects of the 1988 âWillie Horton was Lee Atwater, the close associate of Karl Rove. In 1990, Atwater would move into the Cedars after he discovered he was dying from brain cancer.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Consolidating Fellowship Power<br /><br /> <br /><br />As with any âarmy,â in this case a Christian army, the Fellowship lost no time in establishing both physical and political bridgeheads in the United States and abroad. First, the Fellowship ensured that its new fortress, âThe Cedars,â was well protected.  Through a variety of incorporated foundations, the Fellowship masked its various real estate investments through various entities, including the Fellowship Foundation, the Wilberforce Foundation, and two used by the Fellowship in the past: Kresage Foundation and Tregaron Foundation. Kresage, at one time, appeared to have links to the Billy Graham Evangelical Association. Tregaron was used in 1975 by the Fellowship and President Ford to search for a purchase a mansion for the Vice President. Ford was significantly closer to the Fellowship than was his predecessor, Nixon. The purchase of a Vice Presidential mansion was no longer necessary when Vice President Nelson Rockefeller moved into the former mansion for the Chief of Naval Operations at the Naval Observatory â it has been the home of the Vice President ever since. According to the minutes of the District of Columbiaâs Advisory Neighborhood Commission 3-C dated January 26, 2004, there is 20 acres of property in Northwest Washington known as the âTregaron property.â There were plans to sell the property for the construction of 16 houses, a plan that was opposed by the Cleveland Park Citizens Association (âCPCAâ) and Friends of Tregaron that wanted the land preserved as a national historic site. It isnear this property that the Klingle Mansion is located. It is noteworthy that records indicate that intern Chandra Levy may have gone to the mansion to meet someone before she was murdered.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Foundation<br /><br />Address<br /><br />Assets<br /><br />Liabilities<br /><br />Wilberforce Foundation<br /><br />705 Melvin Ave Ste 105<br />Annapolis, MD 21401<br /><br />$1,612,691 (end FY 01)<br /><br />$116,000 (end FY 01)<br /><br />Tregaron Foundation (sometimes spelled in Fellowship archives as âTreagonâ<br /><br />Defunct*<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Fellowship Foundation<br /><br />2244 N 24th St<br />Arlington, VA 22207 (Ivanwald)<br /><br />$8,479, 884 (end  FY 02)<br /><br />$1,313, 990 (end FY 02)<br /><br />Kresage Foundation<br /><br />Defunct<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />C Street Center<br /><br />133 C Street SE<br />Washington, DC 20003<br /><br />Officially designated a âchurchâ â IRS filing not required<br /><br /> <br /><br />Prison Fellowship Ministries<br /><br />P.O.

The Fellowship purchased two homes in close proximity to the Cedars that became âgroup homesâ (dormitories) in violation of county ordinances prohibiting such homes without proper state and county accreditation. The Fellowship argued that it had verbal authorization from the county for such homes, a point of contention with some of the non-Fellowship neighbors. The two homes are called Ivanwald (a group home for men) and Potomac Point (a group home for women). It was well known to the neighbors that these group homes were used to house troubled teens and young adults (a significant number of them were the children of prominent politicians and businessmen) but the Fellowship kept the names and home addresses of these mostly out-of-state âguestsâ a secret from the county government and the local Woodmont Civic Association, which began to complain about the out-of-state traffic as well as certain VIP limousines constantly speeding through the quiet residential neighborhood in north Arlington.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Although secrecy was paramount to its operations, the Fellowship saw a need for a public relations point man.  They selected Richard E. Carver, a former Republican mayor of Peoria, Illinois; a reserve Air Force colonel, and Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Financial Management under Ronald Reagan. In 1982, Carver, a member of Reaganâs Commission on Housing, recommended cutting billions of dollars from the Department of Housing and Urban Developmentâs Section 8 housing program. That resulted in thousands of people, including families with children, going homeless across the nation. According to the Chicago Tribune, Carver caused waves in the Air Force when he insisted on purchasing custom made Air Force dinnerware and whiskey glasses from a West German manufacturer for the use of 65 Air Force attaches in capital around the world. It turned out that Carver wanted to impress the top management at Passau, West Germany-based ZF Industries with his abilities to expedite procurement through the vast Air Force bureaucracy. There was one problem for Carver â the Pentagon had a directive prohibiting such purposes except for a very few top flag rank officers. In 1986, Carver bypassed the Secretary of Defense and went straight to the Secretary of the Air Force for authorization to spend $100,000 on the West German dinnerware. When the cost of the dinnerware increased to $115,000, Air Force purchasing officers began to complain. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Subsequently, the West German china manufacturer went through ZF Industries to complain that the cost did not cover shipping. Carver then requested additional money for shipping costs. When that posed a problem, carver suggested that the dinnerware order be increased to $1.1 million to cover the original order in addition to custom made china for 138 commanders, mostly colonels, of Air Force bases and stations around the world. Lt. Gen. Carl Smith, chief of the Air Staff, then put his foot down â telling Carver that his china deal was way out of line. Smith said if colonels received dinnerware, every general would want it also. The bill could top $6.3 million. Smith told Carver the money could be used to improve dilapidated housing for officers and enlisted men in some of the Air Forceâs residential units. Carver told General Smith that he should reconsider, whereupon, Smith retorted with a firm âNo.â In other words, Smith was not about the follow such a ludicrous order from a civilian superior. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Carver eventually left the Pentagon. He hooked up with the Fellowship as its major front man, became a consultant for Smith Barney (it was reported that Carver actually was retained by Smith Barney as a consultant while he still worked at the Pentagon at a fee of $920 a month), and joined ZF Industries as head of its U.S. subsidiary. The Chicago Tribune referred to Carver as an âEd Meese of the Pentagon.â The comparison was serendipitous. Meese, Reaganâs ethically-challenged Attorney General, was also a core member of the Fellowship. One of Carverâs deputies at the time was Ernie Fitzgerald, the whistleblower who, in 1968, identified a $2 billion overrun with the C5A cargo plane. His reputation as a dogged whistleblower on government waste and fraud with contractors, Carver quickly gave Fitzgerald and unfavorable performance report and  transferred Fitzgerald out of his office, which prompted a complaint from Representative John Dingell (D-MI), a determined watchdog on contractor overruns. Carver told People magazine, âErnie has the capacity to really irritate people . . . He has a kind of antagonistic way of doing things.â Certainly, not the way of the Fellowship, where people smile, talk about their commitment to âJesus,â and engage in backroom shady deals. Soon, Carver would turn his attention away from the likes of Fitzgerald and towards the suspicious neighbors of the Cedars.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Residents of the Woodmont neighborhood of Arlington noticed something strange about the Cedars shortly after the Fellowship moved in. One long time Arlingtonian was hired to do some plumbing at the estate. He noticed in 1980 that the estateâs âcarriage houseâ had been converted into a group home. Men and women who stayed there were assigned chores around the complex â women would cook and do the laundry while the men would tend to the lawn and perform other maintenance work. In 1980, the Fellowship referred to themselves not only as âThe Familyâ but also âThe Way.â The plumber also noticed that the old âwell house,â which sat in an extreme corner of the estate, overlooking Washington, DC, was converted into a residence. Although that home appears nowhere on Arlington zoning maps, neighbors have discovered that it serves as the residence for Coe when he visits the Cedars.<br /><br /> <br /><br />After it became apparent that the Fellowship was establishing much more than a place of worship in North Arlington, neighbors became more concerned. The first event that triggered suspicion was when a one-lane bridge that carried cars, bicycles, and pedestrians on North Uhle Street over Spout Run Parkway collapsed. The Fellowship saw to it that without the bridge, it turned its end of what was renamed 24th Street became a secured cul-de-sac. Even though the very end of 24th Street remains county property, the Fellowship painted the bridge supports white to give them the appearance that they were a âgateâ onto the Fellowshipâs private property. When non-Fellowship neighbors tried to have the one-lane bridge rebuilt as a pedestrian and bicycle trail, the Fellowship resorted to a nasty campaign to discredit and harass the proponents. As a result, a mini-civil war broke out in quiet Woodmont. Some residents suggested the Fellowship actually sabotaged the original North Uhle Street bridge to provide permanent secrecy and security. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Similar suspicions surround the purchase by a Fellowship member of the neighboring 19-acre estate property, which was resold to Arlington County. The county turned it into a historic site and park â the Fort C.S. Smith Park. However, a number of residents contend the Fellowship wanted the park to be a security buffer zone. Originally, there were plans to build a nursing home on the adjoining property. Although the park closes at night, it keeps its lights on 24 hours a day. A government source confided the Fellowship worked out a deal with the county to keep the lights on so the parking lot can be used as an emergency heliport in the event the Cedars must evacuate its VIPs.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In August 2003, Ivanwald and the Cedars received the kind of attention it disdains. The Washington Post ran a couple of stories about James Hammond, a 21-year-old male resident of Ivanwald, who broke into four homes in the Woodmont neighborhood looking for prescription drugs. Although he broke into four homes, he pleaded guilty to breaking into only two. Rose Kehoe, the past president of the Woodmont Civic Association, complained about the secrecy associated with the Fellowshipâs dormitories for the troubled youth. Some neighbors argued that criminal background checks should be required for the residents of the Fellowship homes. In addition, residents of Woodmont, who referred to the Fellowship as the âpod people,â complained that additional Fellowship youth were being housed in other Fellowship homes in the neighborhood. Over twenty homes in the Woodmont neighborhood were purchased by Fellowship members as of the end of 2004. Kehoe told the Post, âWe donât know who is running around. We donât know if they are criminals or previous sex offenders.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />One local resident told the Arlington County Board that the young people who stay at the Cedars complex appear âabnormally passive.â She said that they wait for âGod to tell them what to do.â <br /><br /> <br /><br />Passions became inflamed when non-Fellowship residents learned that the Fellowship never possessed a special permit to run group homes in the neighborhood, a violation of Arlington Countyâs zoning laws. Carver, the Fellowship spokesman, insisted the Fellowship had an informal verbal nod from the county. A number of the young residents who filter in and out of Ivanwald and Potomac Point are students from Christian evangelical Westmont College in Santa Barbara, California.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Another bone of contention between the Fellowship and residents was the speeding limousines that transported U.S. and international political VIPs to and from the Cedars. On Tuesday mornings, the Cedars hosts an âambassadors breakfast,â while on Thursday mornings, former Senator Charles Percy hosts something called the âInternational Finance Meetingâ for 25 people. One retired Washington, DC newspaper editor who has lived in Woodmont for 48 years referred to the Fellowship as the ârich Christians.â <br /><br /> <br /><br />A U.S. State Department bus transports foreign and U.S. diplomats to and from the Cedars for the Tuesday morning 7:30-9:30 a.m. meeting. Yet more limousines arrive at the Cedars for a meeting held at 9:30 p.m. on Sundays. The county placed speed bumps on 24th Street to answer the concerns about speeding motorcades but they did not deter the speeding. One neighbor estimated that there are some 80 limousine trips per week to the Cedars. Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat visited the Cedars in 1999 complete with his automatic weapon-carrying security guards. Out-of-state license plates abound at the Cedars compound. <br /><br /> <br /><br />To say that the Cedars is wired into American foreign policy would be an extreme understatement. One of the Fellowshipâs core members with significant links to the foreign policy establishment, including the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), is Dr. Douglas Johnston, a veteran of nuclear submarines, Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Navy and Director of Policy Planning and Management in the Office of the Secretary of Defense under Jimmy Carter, and the founder and president of the International Center for Religion and Diplomacy. Johnston, who was involved in various international conflict resolution programs, prepared a conflict resolution casebook in which he cites Buchmanâs Moral Rearmament post-war reconciliation efforts between Germany and France. Of course, for Buchman and his friends, those efforts largely involved nothing more than reintegrating supporters of the German Nazis and Vichy French back into government and business.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Cedars have hosted various world leaders â becoming what has amounted to a shadow State Department. Perhaps its importance as an international rendezvous point is why several miles of fiber optic cables have been installed at the Cedars by Verizon and Comcast. In one instance, the Fellowship requested permission to build an âunderground chapelâ on the Cedars premises. Although the facility was never built, neighbors suspected that it was a bomb shelter.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Local residents, who, as they put it, have not drunk the Fellowshipâs âKool Aid,â point to the constantly expanding Fellowship enclave in Arlington. They claim the Fellowship has taken over two local church congregations â Falls Church Episcopal and Cherrydale Baptist â as well as opening their own private school â Rivendell.  Two other northern Virginia churches reportedly have a number of Fellowship congregants â Potomac Falls Episcopal and McLean Bible Church. In addition, Arlington skeptics of the Fellowship point to the increasing political clout of the Fellowship, for example, in placing one of its members, Michael Foster, on the Arlington Planning Commission as chairman, successfully buying the votes of four of the five members of the Arlington County Board (all Democrats), and installing an ally as president of the Woodmont Civic Association.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Sometimes, the Fellowship invites members and non-members alike to special functions at the Cedars. For example, it sent out this invitation in 2004:<br /><br /> <br /><br />HISTORY UNITES US<br /><br /> <br /><br />Woodmont Neighbors and Friends of the Cedars<br /><br />Are cordially invited to attend a<br /><br />Free Lecture on<br /><br />Oriental Rugs<br /><br /> <br /><br />Safi Kaskas of Beirut, Lebanon<br /><br /> <br /><br />Saturday, May 1, 2004<br /><br /> <br /><br />Hosts: Hon. And Mrs. Don Bonker [former Democratic Representative from State of Washington]<br /><br /> <br /><br />When non-members attend such functions at the Cedars, they are assigned one person who follows them everywhere they go. In every room in the Cedars, they are always under the watchful gaze of a photograph of Billy Graham. Coe has been referred to as the âshadow Billy Graham.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />According to Arlingtonians who have investigated the Fellowship, Doug Coe once owned a residence in very liberal Takoma Park, Maryland and continues to own residences in Annapolis, Maryland (where he and his followers have similarly taken over a residential area cul-de-sac) and Seattle, Washington, the one-time hometown of his mentor Vereide. Local politicians point to the Fellowshipâs generous political contributions as a way of buying influence and maintaining their secrecy in the county. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Another troublesome aspect to the Fellowshipâs expanding presence in Arlington is a resurgence of Nazi activity in the county. âWhite powerâ and Nazi groups continue to hold meetings in the same North Arlington neighborhoods where Rockwell and his Nazis once lived. The rise of Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke in Louisiana GOP politics spurred the Nazi movement around the country, including the persistent cell in Arlington. As late as 1999, these meetings attracted Nazi skinheads from around the country as well as foreign leaders, like the leader of the British National Front, a racist, ultra-right party. In addition, there were very recent cases of anti-Semitism experienced by members of one of the local American Legion posts. It should be recalled that the American Legion was to be used as the vanguard of the 1930s right-wing coup against Franklin Roosevelt. In December 2004, suspected white supremacist arsonists set fire to dozens of expensive homes under construction in nearby Indian Head, Maryland in a subdivision called Hunters Brooke. Some of the homes had been purchased by African Americans. At least ten of 26 homes set ablaze were severely damaged. Immediately, the right wing media began blaming âeco-terrorists,â but soon the real culprits were soon uncovered. It emerged that at least five white racists charged with the arson were members of a group called âThe Family,â which is, ironically, one of the names used by the Fellowship.<br /><br /> <br /><br />But the Fellowship has shed much of its former ties to the Nazis and fascists. Although the fascist ideology is behind the scenes, the Fellowship has dropped its explicit hatred for other races and religions. One observer called the Fellowship âFascism with a smiley face.â For a group with so much power, it is amazing that since the early 1970s, only a handful of meaningful articles have been written about it. In the early 1970s, Playboy wrote about Senator Hatfieldâs association with the group. The Portland [Maine] Phoenix wrote a story about Governor Baldacciâs ties to the group and the Las Vegas Weekly looked into Senator Ensignâs membership in the group. Two major exposes were Jeff Sharletâs Harperâs article, âJesus Plus Nothing,â and Lisa Getterâs article in the Los Angeles Times. The Washington Post wrote about the Fellowship after the break-ins of homes in Arlington by resident of Ivanwald and the resulting problems with neighbors and county. Perennial Democratic presidential candidate Lyndon LaRoucheâs various publications have also focused on the Fellowship and its influence in government. But aside from those articles and some mention on a few Weblogs, the Fellowship continued to maintain its preferred secretive existence.<br /><br /> <br /><br />During the 2004 election campaign, northern Virginia Democratic congressional candidate James Socas highlighted the membership in the Fellowship of his opponent, incumbent Republican Frank Wolf. Socas said his research indicated that Wolf was a member of a religious cult whose leadership praised the leadership qualities of Hitler, Ho Chi Minh, Lenin and Osama Bin Laden. The Socas campaign released a report titled, âWho is Frank Wolf? Moderate Republican or Leader of the Religious Right?â The Washington Post also reported on Socasâs charges that Wolf was a member of an extremist religious group and Wolfâs response that the charges were âbogus.â The Fellowshipâs public relations man Carver told the Post that Socasâs charges were âludicrous.â Coe did not return phone calls from the Post. It was the kind of political donnybrook the Fellowship abhorred but here was a congressional candidate bringing to light the membership in âthe Familyâ of one of the Houseâs most powerful Republicans. In yet another example showing the ties between the Fellowship and the neo-conservative movement, the Post quoted Michael Horowitz of the neo-con Hudson Institute defending Wolf. Lamely, and obviously without researching the history of the Fellowship, Horowitz called Socasâs linking of Wolf to a group that praised Hitler nothing more than âhate speechâ and âMcCarthyism.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />Turning the âPeopleâs Houseâ Into the âPeopleâs Templeâ<br /><br /> <br /><br />Adding to the Fellowshipâs perception as a powerful and secretive organization is its ownership of a boarding house and conference center around the corner from the U.S. Capitol at 133 C Street, SE, Washington, DC. At any given time, eight members of the Senate and House have resided at the C Street Center where they sleep, pray, and eat for a mere $600 a month. C Street Center resident Representative Bart Stupak (D-MI) claimed on his Federal Election Commission expense report that he paid the C Street Foundation $762 on December 11, 2001. Similar boarding houses have been set up by the Fellowship in London for Members of Parliament and in Moscow for members of the State Duma.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Past and current residents of the C Street Center have included former Representatives Steve Largent (R-OK) and Ed Bryant (R-TN), former Representative and current Democratic Governor of Maine John E. Baldacci, Senators Sam Brownback (R-KS) (Brownback is also a member of the right-wing Fascist-oriented Opus Dei sect within the Catholic Church), Senator Jim DeMint (R-SC), John Ensign (R-NV), and Tom Coburn (R-OK), Representatives Mike Doyle (R-PA), Bart Stupak (D-MI), Zach Wamp (R-TN), and former Senator Don Nickles (R-OK).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Other past members included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA), Lincoln Chaffee (R-RI), Roger Jepsen (R-IA), Charles Percy (R-IL), Strom Thurmond (R-SC), David Durenberger (R-MN), Jennings Randolph (D-WV), Paul Trible (R-VA), Phil Gramm (R-TX), William Armstrong (R-CO), Lawton Chiles (D-FL), Dan Coats (R-IN), Jeremiah Denton (R-AL), John Stennis (D-MS), Al Gore, Jr. (D-TN), and Larry Pressler (R-SD), and former Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK), Robert Dornan (R-CA), and Tony Hall (D-OH). George W. Bush named Hall, who purported to be a strong defender of human rights, to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for World Hunger. In typical Fellowship fashion, Hall immediately began to lobby the UN on behalf of Monsanto to accept genetically-modified foods.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Other significant members of the Fellowship are Senators Charles Grassley (R-IA), Pete Domenici (R-NM), Conrad Burns (R-MT), Richard Lugar (R-IN), James Inhofe (R-OK), Bill Nelson (D-FL) (Nelsonâs wife Grace serves on the Fellowship Foundationâs Board of Directors), and Rick Santorum (R-PA), Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN), and George Allen (R-VA), Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert (R-IL), Representatives Frank Wolf (R-VA), Tom DeLay (R-TX), Tom Feeney (R-FL), Curt Weldon (R-PA), Jerry Weller (R-IL), and Joseph Pitts (R-PA). <br /><br /> <br /><br />Friends of the Fellowship, if not outright members, include Senators Mitch McConnell (R-KY), Rick Santorum (R-PA), Jon Kyl (R-AZ), House Majority Whip Roy Blunt (R-MO), and former Senator Zell Miller (D-GA).<br /><br /> <br /><br />One of the more interesting affiliates of the Fellowship is Senator and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY). A former âGoldwater Girlâ in the 1964 presidential campaign, Mrs. Clinton  seemed to have partially recovered some of her earlier conservative underpinnings. According to her autobiography, Living History, after her husband became president, Clinton paid a visit to a womenâs meeting at the Cedars on February 24, 1993. Present were Susan Baker (wife of the first Bushâs Secretary of State, James Baker III), Grace Nelson (wife of Floridaâs Bill Nelson), Joanne Kemp (wife of former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp), Linda LeSourd Lader (wife of Clinton ambassador to Britain and founder of the Renaissance Weekend Phil Lader â the Renaissance Weekend in Charleston, South Carolina is billed by Lader as a âspiritualâ event[3]), and Holly Leachman of the Falls Church Episcopal Church (one of the churches taken over by the Fellowship). Leachman and her husband Jerry had been involved in 1997 with a Cleveland, Ohio Fellowship adjunct called the Family Forum. The Leachmans were interviewed by ABCâs Nightline on February 25, 2004. They extolled the virtues of Mel Gibsonâs controversial film, The Passion of the Christ, along with other evangelicals, including some Jewish converts to Christianity.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Senator Clinton admits to having a continuing close relationship with Susan Baker, through Bakerâs visits to Capitol Hill and the letters she and other Fellowship wives wrote her during the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton. Even Bill Clinton seemed to have been taken in by the Fellowship. In his autobiography, My Life, Clinton brags that he never missed a National Prayer Breakfast. In his autobiography, Bill Clinton erroneously writes that it was not until 2000 that Coe invited the first Jew, Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT), to speak at the breakfast. However, New York Mayor Ed Koch spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1981 Senator Jacob Javits in 1984, and Arthur Burns in 1986. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Ironically, it was Susan Bakerâs husband who served as the political fix-it man for Clintonâs Vice President Al Gore in delivering Floridaâs 25 electoral votes to George W. Bush in 2000, costing Gore the White House. In fact, Senator Clinton wrote that all of her relationships with the Fellowship began with the luncheon she attended in 1993.  In her biography, Senator Clinton writes of Douglas Coe, â[he] is a genuinely loving spiritual mentor . . . Doug Coe became a source of strength and friendship.â Of course, Clinton is referring to the period of time when her husband was being harassed by conservative Republicans out for blood â the Whitewater investigation and impeachment hearings brought about by what she called the âvast right-wing conspiracyâ against her husband. It is amazing that Mrs. Clinton would have established such a trusting relationship with people who were the âvast right-wing conspiracyâ that she complained about so vociferously. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Nevertheless, Mrs. Clinton remained close to Coe, who she invited to accompany her as a member of the U.S. delegation that attended Mother Theresaâs state funeral in Calcutta in 1997. Mother Theresa had spoken at Coeâs National Prayer Breakfast meeting in Washington in 1994. From that platform, Mother Theresa launched a verbal broadside against President Clintonâs pro-abortion policy. For Coe, being at Mother Theresaâs state funeral was a strange juxtaposition from his reported attendance at Bohemian Grove meetings of San Franciscoâs elite Bohemian Club â festivities that are replete with pagan rites. But as one senior Pentagon official said, âthe Fellowship has nothing to do with God or Jesus, it is a capitalist cult.â One of the major members of the Bohemian Club is former NASA administrator Sean OâKeefe, who is also close to conservative Christian Representative Tom Feeney (R-FL), the former Lieutenant Governor running mate of Jeb Bush in the 1994 Florida gubernatorial election, a major political operative in 2000âs fixed presidential election when he was Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, attorney and registered lobbyist for Yang Enterprises â the NASA contractor accused of creating rigged election software and spying for China, and the politician accused of helping to launder large sums of money through the Florida Department of Transportation â the agency that controls one of Floridaâs biggest cash cows â the toll turnpikes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Other important women members of the Fellowship are Interior Secretary Gale Norton, former Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Eileen Bakke, the wife of former Advanced Energy Systems (AES) CEO Dennis Bakke. Dennis Bakke, who was succeeded at AES by former George H. W. Bush Budget director and current Carlyle Group official Richard Darman, resigned after allegations that Bakke funneled AES revenues into the Fellowship. AES became infamous when it took over the Republic of Georgiaâs electrical distribution system and began cutting off electricity to those who never paid for it under Soviet rule. Affected were elderly people on fixed pensions, young couples, and even the Tbilisi airport and an important military base. Dennis Bakke is a resident of the Cedars neighborhood where he owns an estate called Dogwood Rise.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Entertainers and sports figures have also been featured at the Fellowshipâs political prayer meetings over the years. They have included Jim Nabors, Dallas Cowboy coach Tom Landry, and the Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs and fullback Charlie Harraway.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Not every member of Congress thought the Fellowshipâs activities on Capitol Hill were appropriate. Former Senator Lowell Weicker (R-CT) told The Washington Post in 1981 that the Christian evangelicals âwant to proselytize the whole country . . . Thatâs what Iâm fighting against.â Former Senator and Democratic presidential candidate George McGovern (D-SD), the son of a minister, told the Post, âthose guys have such a personal view of religion that it isnât reflected on the Senate floor -- if anything, they lean over backwards to avoid social issues . . . one of my criticisms is that they donât see the social implication of moral and religious faith.â Former South Carolina Senator Fritz Hollings (D-SC), a devout Lutheran, never went to a Fellowship meeting. According to long-time investigative journalist Robert Parry, in 1983, Representative Jim Leach (R-IA), speaking at a meeting of the moderate Republican Ripon Society, warned that the College National Republican Committee, once headed by Karl Rove, had solicited and received money from Moonâs Unification Church. Roveâs successor, Grover Norquist, disrupted Leachâs presentation. Norquist is now an unofficial adviser to both Rove and George W. Bush. And like the Fellowship, also had links to the Similarly, for those who question or criticize the Fellowship, Coe has a patent response, âThey are enemies of Jesus.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />A senator who incurred the wrath of the Fellowship and its allies was the man who challenged George W. Bush for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000 â John McCain. After McCain beat Bush in New Hampshire, the right-wing evangelicals pulled out all the stops to nail McCain on their home turf â South Carolina. Christian operatives associated with Karl Rove, Ralph Reed, and South Carolinaâs Bob Jones University began spreading rumors â through âpush polls,â e-mail, sermons, and word-of-mouth that McCain fathered an illegitimate âblack girlâ out of wed lock (a reference to his adopted Bangladeshi daughter), that he was a traitor while a prisoner of war in North Vietnam, that his wife Cindy was a druggie, and that he was gay. The gambit paid off. McCain was trounced by Bush in South Carolina and Bush went on to win the Republican nomination. For the Christian mafia, Bush was their best hope for total control since the founding of the United States. Next, the fundamentalists turned their attention to the Democratic nominee â Al Gore, a former theological seminary student.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Although Gore won the popular vote for President, a phalanx of right-wing GOP operatives descended on the pivotal state of Florida to engage in judicial subterfuge after widespread voter suppression took place at the polling places. Two fundamentalists on the U.S. Supreme Court â Antonin Scalia (an Opus Dei member) and Clarence Thomas â voted with three other members to stop the Florida vote recount, ensuring that Bush won the White House. Nevertheless, Gore has always admired Doug Coe, even calling him his âpersonal hero.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Moon organization also gained immense influence in the George W. Bush administration. Not only had Bushâs father taken Moonâs money to give speeches after he left office, but the junior Bush appointed Unification Church members to sensitive posts in his administration. David Caprara, head of Moonâs American Family Coalition, was appointed to head the AmericCorpsâs anti-poverty program, VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America). Moonâs rhetoric would track with the right-wing policies of Bush â Moon called gays âdung eating dogsâ and American women âprostitutes.â And hearkening back to the days of Vereide and Buchman and their Nazi friends, Moon said the Holocaust was Godâs revenge for the crucifixion of Christ. <br /><br /><br />The Fellowshipâs Very Own Foreign Policy<br /><br /> <br /><br />Perhaps one of the most important aspects of the Fellowship is their involvement in international affairs at the highest levels. Ever since Vereide sent emissaries abroad to further the aims of the Fellowship, the group had sought access at the highest levels of governments abroad. A significant Fellowship presence was established in various English-speaking countries â Britain, Canada, Australia, and South Africa â as well as the Netherlands, Germany, France, India, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea, and countries in Scandinavia, Latin America, and Africa. Thanks to the support of two ministers in General Francoâs Fascist Spanish government, Vereide and Coe were able to penetrate Spain and obtain adherents, mostly through the offices of the neo-Fascist Catholic Opus Dei sect. Vereide was also able to convince Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie to be a major supporter of the Fellowship. Chiang Kai-Shekâs Nationalist Chinese government was also a supporter and remains one to this day. Every year, the Fellowshipâs C Street Center receives a $10,000 check from the head of Taiwanâs mission in Washington. The Fellowship also established close links to Liberiaâs autocratic President William Tubman. Today, Fellowship adherents are even found in the leftist government of Brazilâs President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva. Fijian dictator Sitiveni Rabuka is a Fellowship member. He also overthrew his nationâs democratically-elected government. In Canada, a Fellowship ally, the extreme conservative Stockwell Day of the Canadian Alliance, calls for the establishment of a Christian state. He wants to overturn the Canadian Supreme Courtâs decision to legalize gay marriage, wants public funding of private religious schools, and outlaw abortion. Day hopes to one day become Canadaâs Prime Minister. One Fellowship denomination in Toronto, the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship, was expelled from its parent denomination, the Vineyard Churches of Anaheim, California. The parent body cited the Toronto churchâs prayer and Scripture interpretation practices. Another one of those who the Fellowship counts as a friend is French far-right leader Jean Marie Le Pen. The French leader has created a firestorm of protests in France and elsewhere by claiming the Nazi occupiers of France were not so brutal and that the Nazis were not inhumane. It is the same rhetoric once espoused by Vereide, Buchman, and Gedat.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Fellowshipâs involvement in foreign countries is documented in archived files held at the Billy Graham Center at Wheaton College in Illinois. Organized in a manner similar to how the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) stores and segregates files, the Fellowshipâs archives consist of 592 boxes of documents, photos, audiotapes, film, and negatives. The documents are have an automatic declassification schedule, in the same manner that NARA handles classified files. The Fellowshipâs new policy, adopted in 2003, states âAll folders with paper records less than twenty-five years old are closed to users until January 1st of the year following the 25th anniversary of the creation of the youngest document in that file, except to those users with the written permission of the President of the Fellowship Foundation. This restriction applies to everyone, including Foundation staff and associates. Example: A folder containing material dated no later 1977 would be open January 1, 2003.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />Coe has been one of the Fellowshipâs most frequent travelers. A review of international wire service stories reveal Coe globe hopping with congressional Fellowship members for a number of years. From Pakistan Newswire, Islamabad, on November 29, 2000 (a little less than a year before 911 and a few weeks after the presidential election): âA five-member US business delegation headed by Mr. Douglas Coe, Special envoy of Congressman Mr. Joseph Pitts, called on Federal Minister for Commerce, Industries and Production Mr. Abdul Razak Dawood at Ministry of Industries and Production here on Wednesday.â From the Polish Press Agency, Warsaw, December 17, 1997: âFormer deputy Sejm speaker Aleksander Malachowski was granted Wednesday the St. Brother Albert award for his concern for âthe weak and those in needâ and his âsocial journalism characterised by humanistic values.â In the scope of ecumenical activity the awards went to priest Waldemar Chrostowski and Stanislaw Krajewski for creating the foundations of Christian-Jewish dialogue and Douglas Coe from the United States for organizing annual meetings of politicians in Washington for furthering communication regardless of political divisions.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />From Xinhua News Agency, Havana, November 27, 1990: âTwo U.S. congressmen arrived here Monday on the first stage of a 10-day visit to the Caribbean to seek ways of understanding between the united states and the region, the official news agency Prensa Latina informed. Republican senator for Minnesota and Tony Hall, the Democrat representative for Ohio, are traveling as members of the âNational Prayer Breakfastâ religious organization, which aims to promote friendship between peoples. Upon his arrival, Durenberger told the press, âwe are visiting Cuba with the goal to make new friends on a personal basis.â Political relations reflect personal ties and in the case of Cuba, and the United States âthere are no political or personal ties,â he said. Hall affirmed that their visit, which will last little more than 24 hours, aims to âbuild bridges between political and personal lines,â and help create âways of communicationâ between the two countries. The two congressmen expressed their hope that the relations between the two nations, which were suspended in 1961, can improve in the near future. Durenberger was a member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee for eight years and severely criticized former President Ronald Reagan's policy of force against Nicaragua. The delegation which also includes Douglas Coe, a member of the âNational Prayer Breakfastâ Executive Board, and other businessmen will also visit the Grand Cayman Island, Belize, Aruba and Venezuela.â<br /><br /><br /><br />The trip to off-shore banking havens by the Fellowship delegation is of note. These were the same islands noted by former U.S. intelligence operatives as the location of billion dollar money tranches and corporate artifices used by the Bush family to engage in various illegal activities, including drug money laundering, corporate fraud, and funding the fixing of elections. The Fellowship not only had an interest in Caribbean off-shore banking havens but made special invitations to Cook Islands Prime Minister Geoffrey Henry and Fiji Prime Minister Sir Ratu Kamisese Mara. Both island nations are off-shore banking havens and the Cook Islands featured prominently in the transfer of money and gold looted from the Philippines and placed in Bush-controlled secret accounts following Marcosâs overthrow in the 1980s. Henry and Mara were guests at the National Prayer Breakfast in 1991 where George H. W. Bush was also present.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In 1987, Coe was in Mongolia, officially as a tourist (Mongolia was still Communist). However, shortly after Communism fell, the Fellowship and the Moon organization set up shop in the largely Buddhist country. Fellowship missionaries fanned out across to other Buddhist regions that had been close for years to outsiders: the Russian Buddhist Republics of Tuva, Kalmykia, Buryatia, and Evenkia. The Fellowship called them âunreached peoples.â Similarly, after the recent tsunamis that killed over a quarter million people in South and Southeast Asia, fundamentalist Christian aid workers arrived with more than relief in mind. Local officials in Sri Lanka and Indonesia complained about the relief workers using the disaster to proselytize and adopt orphans into Christian homes. The people of the worst affected area, Aceh in Sumatra, were also referred to as âunreached people,â meaning they had not yet been subject to conversion outreach.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Fellowship also had a keen interest in intelligence matters, especially when they involved Fellowship members. For example, one of the tape reels held by the Fellowship at the Billy Graham Center concerns the use by the CIA of journalists as informants. The tape is described: âReel-to-reel, 7 Â½ ips. 1 side only. January 23, 1976. Radio program Panorama, broadcast on station WTTG in Washington, DC, hosted by Maury Povich, with commentator Ms. Bonnie Angelo. The guest on the show is correspondent and informant for the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The conversation is about contacts between U.S. intelligence agencies and journalists. Chuck Colson is referred to very briefly during the interview, in reference to knowledge of a list in the Nixon White House of journalists who were intelligence informants.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Fellowshipâs influence in Vereideâs native country of Norway was revealed in late 2004 when the Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet exposed Norwayâs Lutheran minister and Christian Democratic Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik as a secret member of the Fellowship. Although Bondevik at first downplayed his role in the Fellowship, Bondevik later was forced to admit that in December 2001 he met at a dinner at the Cedars with then-Attorney General Ashcroft and that the meeting involved his official role as Prime Minister. Apparently, Bondevik and Ashcroft discussed the U.S. military tribunals. Ashcroft referred to Bondevik as his âbrother in Christâ and he serenaded Bondevik Norwegian folk songs after dinner. Bondevik had previously argued that his involvement with the Fellowship was a personal matter. In addition, it was revealed that Norwayâs ambassador to the United States, Knut Vollebuk, was a frequent visitor to the Cedars as were a number of members of Norwayâs Christian Democratic Party.  As the scandal deepened, Coeâs involvement in Norwegian politics came to the fore. Torkel Brekke, a Norwegian religious researcher, revealed in his book Gud i norsk politkk (God in Norwegian Politics) that Coe provided advice and money to Christian Democrat politician Lars Rise. During a campaign in 1997, Coe told Rise to target voters in the heavily Muslim eastern part of Oslo. Coe emphasized that Christians and Muslims shared common views on the evils of pornography, alcohol, abortion, and same sex marriages. For Rise, the strategy was successful although a subsequent election saw him dropped as a Christian Democratic candidate. The Coe-Rise affair points to the alliance the Fellowship has formed over the years with Muslims, particularly more radical Islamists. For example, in 1988, the first Muslim, Saudi Prince Bandar, spoke at the National Prayer Breakfast. <br /><br /> <br /><br />Norwayâs opposition political leaders, from the right to the left, demanded an explanation from Bondevik about the role of the Fellowship in Norwegian politics. Socialist Left leader Kristin Halvorsen told the Oslo daily Aftenposten, âseen with Norwegian eyes, this is a reactionary association.â The Labor Party and right-wing Progress Party also raised concerns about Bondevik and the Fellowship. For many Norwegians, Bondevik was tied with George W. Bush through a secret and right-wing fundamentalist group. <br /><br /> <br /><br />It has also been reported that under the Bush administration, U.S. embassies have held prayer breakfast meetings as a way of buying access to U.S. officials, particularly those involved in important trade and defense issues. Such meetings have been reported taking place in U.S. embassies in Copenhagen; Oslo; Stockholm; Helsinki; Tallinn, Estonia; Vilnius, Lithuania; Bern, Switzerland; Luxembourg; The Hague; Rome; Brussels; Canberra; Port Louis, Mauritius; New Delhi; Mexico City; Belize; Warsaw; Vienna; Berlin; and Prague.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Fellowship members are found in governments throughout the world. This is not surprising considering the country-by-country files the Fellowship has on its worldwide activities. There are files on such hotspots as Afghanistan, Algeria, Cuba, Greece (with a special file on 1967 -- the year of the nationâs military coup), Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Indonesia, Israel, Korea, Kuwait, Northern Ireland, Pakistan, Panama and the Canal Zone, Poland, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Vietnam, and Zimbabwe. The files also cover the Fellowshipâs activities in the more obscure Sao Tome and Principe, Upper Volta, Mali, and Aruba. One country that is missing from the Fellowship files is Chile, where on September 11, 1973, a bloody U.S.-inspired coup was launched against the socialist government. That coup resulted in the assassination of President Salvador Allende and years of suppression that saw the murder of thousands of opponents of fascism.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The National Prayer Breakfasts serve as important opportunities for foreign leaders to meet with American presidents. Leaders like former Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, South African Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Hungarian President Arpad Goncz, Rwandan President Paul Kagame, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his wife Janet, King Taufaâahau Tupuo IV of Tonga, the late Macedonian President (and Methodist minister) Boris Trajkovski, and leaders of Lithuania, Slovakia, Albania, and Romania have all sought the offices of Coe and the Fellowship to meet the President of the United States. The 2003 National Prayer Breakfast drew 3 heads of government, 21 Cabinet ministers, 11 Members of Parliament, 54 ambassadors, 56 U.S. senators, 245 U.S. House members, and a majority of Bushâs Cabinet secretaries. <br /><br /><br /><br />In 2001, the unlikely joint appearance of Congoâs new President Joseph Kabila and his arch-enemy (but one-time mentor) Kagame at the 2001 Prayer Breakfast just after Bushâs inauguration raised eyebrows. Although they could not arrange a separate meeting with Bush, the two leaders did meet at the Cedars. What was unusual is that on January 16, 2001, just four days before Bushâs swearing in, Kabilaâs father, the former Marxist rebel Laurent Kabila, was assassinated in the Congolese capital Kinshasa. Observers suspected Rwandan influence behind the assassination. The elder Kabila was battling Rwandan army units in the eastern Congo. Forty years earlier, almost to the hour, Congoâs first Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba, was executed by U.S.-backed mercenaries working for the CIA. It was also four days before President Kennedy was sworn in as President.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Coeâs invitations to various leaders would pay off for George W. Bush. When he had to cobble together a âCoalition of the Willingâ to support his invasion of Iraq, Bush was able to call on Fellowship leaders to sign on. It was through their Fellowship connections that the leaders of Albania, Palau, Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Uganda, Rwanda, Tonga, Romania, Lithuania, Solomon Islands, El Salvador, and other countries signed on to the âcoalition.â<br /><br /> <br /><br />Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-MD) told the Los Angeles Times he did not think much of the Fellowshipâs backdoor diplomacy, âWell, if I might observe, Iâm not sure a head of state ought to be able to wander over here for the prayer breakfast and, in effect, compel the president of the United States to meet with him as a consequence . . . I mean, getting these meetings with the president is a process thatâs usually very carefully vetted and worked up. Now sort of this back door has sort of evolved.â <br /><br /> <br /><br />Coeâs son David apparently did not think much of Bushâs war against Afghanistan. According to a Fellowship insider, the younger Coe spoke derisively of Bushâs Afghan campaign, asking rhetorically, âthis is his vision?â David Coe indicated that Afghanistan was small potatoes and that if one wanted to see a real military campaign, the exploits of Genghis Khan and his invasion of Afghanistan should be studied.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The involvement of the Fellowship in central Africaâs woes may be deeper than in organizing meetings at prayer breakfasts. On April 6, 1994, the executive jet carrying the Hutu Presidents of Rwanda and Burundi from a peace summit in Tanzania with Kagameâs U.S.-backed guerrilla army in Uganda was shot down by Soviet made surface-to-air missiles captured by U.S. forces from Iraq in Desert Storm. All aboard the presidential aircraft were killed, including the French crew. That prompted a terrorism investigation by a special French anti-terrorism court. The authorâs book, Genocide and Covert Operations in Africa 1993-1999 prompted an invitation by the chief judge to testify as an expert witness about the shooting down of the Rwandan plane. <br /><br /> <br /><br />It was during that testimony, the author was asked to investigate a secretive group made up of right-wing Republicans, current and former intelligence agents, U.S. oil interests and particularly associates of then Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage. Evidence indicated that the group was involved in the terror attack on the Rwandan aircraft. One ad hoc name for the group uncovered by French intelligence and law enforcement was the âInternational Strategic and Tactical Organizationâ or âISTO.â In fact, the description provided of the group by the French and the Fellowship match almost completely. The location of Armitageâs consulting firm, Armitage & Associates LC (AALC) in the Kellogg, Brown & Root/Halliburton building in Rosslyn (Arlington), Virginia, just around the corner from Advanced Energy Systems and a few miles from the Cedars pointed to the Fellowship as the secretive and dangerous group the French counter-terrorism investigators had discovered during their five year investigation. The results of the downing of the aircraft were staggering: 800,000 people died in Rwanda in Hutu-Tutsi ethnic warfare after the attack, tens of thousands died in similar ethnic strife in Burundi. But in Congo, some 4 million died after successive U.S.-supported Ugandan and Rwandan invasions of the country. The deaths resulted from warfare, famine, and disease brought about by the invasions. However, U.S. gem, mining, and oil companies made handsome profits in central Africa amidst the war and ethnic turmoil. Richard Sezibera, Rwandaâs ambassador to the United States and Kagameâs special envoy for Africaâs Great Lakes region, is a frequent guest at the Cedars. One interesting footnote â a senior U.S. government official ran into Doug Coe during the height of the inter-ethnic warfare in central Africa. Coe was in Burundi.<br /><br /> <br /><br />If Islamist fundamentalists can embrace terrorism, can fundamentalist âEnd Timeâ Christians? The FBI thinks so. Prior to 2000, the FBI, in a report titled âProject Megiddoâ warned that Christian millenialist sects might use the beginning of the 21st century to pull of a grand terrorist act. The report stated, âThe volatile mix of apocalyptic religious and [New World Order] conspiracy theories may produce violent acts aimed at precipitating the end of the world as prophesied in the Bible.â The name Meggido refers to a hill in northern Israel that was the site of a number of Biblical battles. âArmageddonâ is Hebrew for Megiddo Hill. The FBI report warned that Christian millenialists might strike military installations and buildings in New York City such as the UN headquarters.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Stealing an Election for Christ<br /><br />According to Time magazine, after Bushâs re-election, a group of evangelicals, not surprisingly known as âThe Arlington Group,â wrote Karl Rove a letter signed by former presidential candidate Gary Bauer, Don Wildmon, Focus on the Familyâs James Dobson, Paul Weyrich and Jerry Falwell demanding that Bush not waver and support a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. Rove is a key Fellowship asset in the White House. Often whistling âOnward Christian Soldiersâ in the halls of the White House, Rove was credited with turning out millions of fundamentalist voters in the 2004 presidential election. Rove also managed to turn out hundreds, if not thousands, of evangelical and fundamentalist election âfixers,â who ensured that Democratic votes were suppressed, miscounted, undercounted, discounted, and not counted.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The Fellowshipâs network of fundamentalists would never be as important as it was in the 2004 presidential election. With polls showing the race either tied or with Democratic candidate John Kerry ahead in key âswingâ states, the alert to very zealous Christian activist went out across the nation. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The prime target was Ohio, where the Fellowship and its fundamentalist allies had built up a vast network of operatives in state and local government, including state agencies and county election boards. But more importantly, the Fellowship had links to the election machine companies that would be crucial to fixing election results in Ohio, Florida, New Mexico, Nevada, and other states â ensuring that Fellowship core member George W. Bush had four more years to put a practically indelible fundamentalist stamp on the United States. The money invested over the years by Lennon, Armington, Lindner, and other right-wing Ohio captains of industry in fundamentalist Christian causes and think tanks like the Ashbrook Center finally paid off. The Ohio Secretary of State, Kenneth Blackwell, who, copying Katherine Harrisâs antics in Floridaâs fraudulent 2000 election, used his government position and his co-chairmanship of Bushâs state election campaign to suppress the vote, especially in largely Democratic African-American districts.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Blackwell, who, as a former Deputy Undersecretary of HUD, was well versed in the art of distributing Bush political slush fund money and ensured that this was distributed far and wide in Ohio. This money is what Republican strategist Ed Rollins once called âwalking around moneyâ â money used by Republicans in New Jerseyâs elections to pay off African American preachers to turn out the vote for their candidates. In Ohio, this tactic paid off in polling places in churches. Instead of turning out the vote, some local preachers, white and black, aided and abetted in suppressing the vote. One of Blackwellâs closest friends is fundamentalist preacher Ron Parsley of World Harvest Church. At the New Life fundamentalist church in the Gahanna District of Columbus, machines tallied 4258 votes for Bush when only a total of 628 votes were cast. Similar chicanery and racketeering occurred throughout Ohio and in other states during the vote tabulation and recounting processes. Two of the voting machine companies contracted by Ohio are headed by people who are conservative Republican partisans â Walden OâDell, the CEO of Diebold of Columbus and the Rapp family that runs Triad Government Systems of Xenia, Ohio. Both brand of machines caused election problems in Ohio and elsewhere.<br /><br /> <br /><br />For example, several churches in Mahoning County, Ohio were the scenes of voting irregularities. They include:<br /><br /> <br /><br />Price Memorial Zion Church, Precinct 2E, Youngstown (voters were given confusing information and many elderly voters were told their polling place had changed, also voters voting for Kerry had their votes switched to Bush).<br /><br /> <br /><br />Spanish Evangelical Church, Precinct 2A, Youngstown, machines inoperative and switched votes from Kerry to Bush.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Elizabeth Baptist Church, Precinct 2C, Youngstown, one voting machine failed to record votes properly.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Tabernacle Baptist Church, Precinct 3C, Youngstown, one machine failed to record votes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Martin Luther Lutheran Church, Precinct 5F, Youngstown, one touch screen machine broken the other erased votes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />St. Johnâs Greek Orthodox Church, Boardman, first two attempts to vote for Kerry go to Bush, third attempt records vote for Kerry. Poll worker brushes off complaints.<br /><br /> <br /><br />St. Nicholas Byzantine Church, Youngstown, machine records Kerry votes for Bush.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The skimming of votes in Mahoning County was replicated across the state. Ohioâs 20 electoral votes were delivered to George W. Bush just like manna from the heavens. For the fundamentalists who took part in the fraud, the âChristianâ ends were definitely justified by the Machiavellian ways.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /><br />Waiting for God<br /><br /> <br /><br />Journalist, columnist, and television commentator Bill Moyers recently wrote that âfor the first time in our history, ideology and theology hold a monopoly of power in Washington.â Ever since Abraham Vereide, a misguided immigrant to this country who brought very un-American ideas of Nazism and Fascism with him in his steamer trunk, the so-called âChristianâ Right has long waited to take the biggest prize of all â the White House. Moyers correctly sees the Dominionists or âEnd Timersâ as being behind the invasion of Iraq. He cites the Book of Revelation that states, âfour angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates will be released to slay the third part of man.â Such words may have their place in Sunday School and in church halls but using such thinking to launch wars of convenience or religious prophecy have no place in our federal and democratic republic. Moyers also rightly sees fundamentalist thought behind Bushâs âfaith-based initiativesâ and the rolling back of environmental regulations.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Hundreds of millions of people around the world no longer feel the United States is a country that can be trusted. They feel the people who run the affairs of state are out of control and dangerous. Considering the hold the Fellowship and their like-minded ilk have on the United States (and some of its allies) they are correct in their fears.<br /><br /> <br /><br />The political and religious dynasties who have embraced the Fellowship, Vereide, Fascism, Moon, Buchman, Moral Rearmament and all of their current and past manifestations, hatreds, and phobias show no sign of ceding power any time soon. There are many such father-son dynasties that hope to ensure a continuation of their shameful racketeering and political chicanery under the corporate âlogoâ of Jesus: George H. W. Bush to George W. Bush; Douglas Coe to David Coe; Billy Graham to Franklin Graham; Oral Roberts to Richard Roberts, Pat Robertson to Gordon Robertson; Jerry Falwell to Jonathan Falwell; Jeb Bush to George P. Bush; Robert Schuller Sr. to Robert Schuller, Jr., and Sun Myung Moon to at least nine sons (who are known about).<br /><br /> <br /><br />For them and their followers, they should keep in mind something Jesus said, âMake a tree good and its fruit will be good, or make a tree bad and its fruit will be bad, for a tree is recognized by its fruit.â <br /><br /> <br /><br />Amen.<br /><br /><br />[1] William A. H. Birnie, âHitler or Any Fascist Leader Controlled By God Could Cure All Ills of World, Buchman Believes,â New York World Telegram August 26, 1936.<br /><br />[2] One conservative Christian picked up similar notions from George W. Bushâs second inaugural speech. Christian commentator John Lofton questioned Bushâs praise of the Koran during his speech and his giving the Islamic text equal weight to the Old and New Testaments. Lofton also questioned Bushâs failure to mention Jesus Christ in his Christmas address a few weeks earlier. Lofton noted, âBush failed to mention the name of Christ -- yet he honored Ramadan and an Indian holiday that features an eight-legged elephant god.â What many evangelical Christians fail to understand is that as a âone world religionâ adherent of Vereide and Buchman, Bush only pays lip service to Jesus while advancing a Dominionist (âfascistâ) plan for global control.

It was at the Renaissance Weekend functions that Bill Clintonâs and Tony Blairâs idea of a âThird Wayâ between capitalism and socialism was developed.
