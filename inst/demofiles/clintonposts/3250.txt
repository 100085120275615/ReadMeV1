<div>I'm up to my ears in Alligators at the moment, but I asked for,  and received permission from <a href="http://www.technonerdmusings.blogspot.com/">Hariseldon67</a>   to make a post with this long ago, and never did it.  Now's a great time, since I don't have time to write my own.:)  So with a nod of appreciation and gratitude to my good friend up in Gopher land, here's a good one ready made.<br />Cheers,<br />TUA<br />
<br /> <div> THINGS YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE TO VOTE REPUBLICAN TODAY....<br />
<br />Jesus loves  you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals<br />and Hillary Clinton.<br />
<br />Saddam  was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy<br />when Bush's daddy made war on  him, a good guy when<br />Cheney did business with him, and a bad guy when  Bush<br />needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.<br />
<br />Trade with Cuba is  wrong because the country is<br />Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is  vital<br />to a spirit of  international harmony.<br />
<br />The  United States  should get out of the United<br />Nations, and our highest national priority  is<br />enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.<br />
<br />A woman can't be trusted  with decisions about her own<br />body, but multi-national corporations can  make<br />decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.<br />
<br />The best way  to improve  military morale is to praise<br />the troops in speeches, while  slashing veterans'<br />benefits  and combat pay.<br />
<br />If condoms are kept  out  of schools, adolescents won't<br />have sex.<br />
<br />A good way to fight terrorism  is to belittle our<br />long-time allies, then demand their cooperation  and<br />money.<br />
<br />Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy,<br />but  providing health care to all Americans is socialism.<br />HMOs and insurance  companies have the  best interests<br />of the public at heart.<br />
<br />Global  warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk<br />science, but creationism should  be taught in schools.<br />
<br />A president lying about an extramarital affair is  an<br />impeachable offense, but a president lying to enlist<br />support for a war  in which thousands die is solid<br />defense policy.<br />
<br />Government should  limit itself to the powers named in<br />the Constitution, which include banning  gay marriages<br />and censoring the Internet.<br />
<br />The public has a right to  know about Hillary's cattle<br />trades, but George Bush's driving record is none  of<br />our business.<br />
<br />Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a  crime,<br />unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an<br />illness and  you need our prayers for your recovery.<br />
<br />You support states' rights, but  the Attorney General<br />can tell states what local voter initiatives they  have<br />the right to adopt.<br />
<br />What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of  vital<br />national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s  is<br />irrelevant.<br />
<br />Feel free to pass this on. If you don't, we're likely  be stuck with<br />more Republicans in  '06  and '08.<br />
