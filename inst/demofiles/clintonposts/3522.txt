Based on Hillary Lang's "Wee Wonderful Wee" pattern, we will spend the morning making this simple soft toy.  They are endlessly cute and can be personalized in limitless ways.  This workshop will guide you through the basic of constructing a stuffed toy and you will leave with one to keep for yourself, or spread the cuteness and give as a gift!<br />

Whenever there's time, she love to sew in her home studio and creates all kinds of soft toys, accessories for her home and children, using a mixture of new and vintage or otherwise recycled materials.  She has a great appreciation for the unique, one-of-a-kind world of handmade toys, and finds the mass-produced world a bit boring these days.  You can find her personal musings about the things she creates at<br />
