Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery</p><p>- Government should relax regulation of Big Business and Big Money but crack down on individuals who use marijuana to relieve the pain of illness</p><p>- "Standing Tall for America" means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India</p><p>- A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation</p><p>- Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of gays and Hillary Clinton</p><p>- The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay. </p><p>- If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex</p><p>- A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money</p><p>- HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at heart</p><p>- Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.</p><p>- Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools</p><p>- Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion</p><p>- A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.</p><p>- Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet</p><p>- The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.</p><p>-Black people in this country have the same opportunities in life as white people.</p><p>-Being born with money doesn't give you any advantages or benefits over people who are born without it. </p><p>-Babies who are born poor are just lazy.</p><p>-Child safety caps on aspirin, channel lock outs on TVs, and child safety locks on car doors are a great way to keep our children safe; Child safety locks on semi-automatic weapons is Communism.</p><p>- What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.</p><p>- Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony </p>
