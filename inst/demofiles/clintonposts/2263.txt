<span>Dear Kimster,<br />I am going on a date with this hot chick I met at the office. I am no Brad Pitt, so I am pretty nervous about the whole prospect. I donât want to blow it, and if anyone is going to do any blowing, it's not gonna be me!!! Any tips?<br />

<br />
<br />You are asking the wrong person, but still, you would do well to take care of the basics. </p>
<ol>
<li>Donât worry if you are not the most handsome guy on earth. The odds may be stacked against you but as a KL city dweller, you will have noticed that the hottest chicks donât always go for the best looking guys. Take a stroll along the coffee outlets around KLCC or along Bintang Walk, and you will see Hillary Swank look-alikes falling for guys who look like starving Siberian Pandas.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Do not be intimidated or discouraged by the prospect. Just remember that you are (a) cool, (b) funny and (c) interesting. And that pretty much makes you (d) a very good catch. You didnât know you were cool, funny, interesting and a very good catch? Oh, come on!!! â that is precisely why you read my blog regularly Mister Man!<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>There is such a thing called âtrying too hardâ and you could end up applying too much artistic licence when it comes to telling your stories to impress a chick. I recommend a strictly-no-lying policy but if you absolutely have to lie, make calculated use of it. It is very hard to lie consistently and keep track, so think hard before you tell her that you can cook an elaborate 20-course dinner and an avid salsa fan. Full-blown lying is only allowed if you have no intention of progressing beyond the 1st date.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>When you are on a date, there is only one thing you need to remember: <strong>
<span>itâs not about you</span>
</strong>. Yes Sir, itâs all about HER, so always make sure that the conversation is focused on HER likes and dislikes, HER interests, the books that SHE is reading. She doesnât want to know if you are super-intelligent, so donât try to impress her by critically discussing the GDP of Somalia over dinner. Talk about the movies that SHE loves, HER hobbies, her worldview - well, you get the picture.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Having said that, if she asked about the songs you like/book you are reading/your interests, by all means answer the questions but donât dwell on them too much. She is being polite, so donât give her a 15-minute commentary of why you consider John Perkinsâ <em>Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</em> to be the most ground-breaking business book in recent memory.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Ask a lot of questions, and when you do that, it is worth remembering this tip from HITCH: â<span>
<em>When she answers, donât be looking at her mouth. Donât be wondering what she looks like naked. LISTEN to what she is saying and respond. That way, when itâs YOUR turn to talk, youâll have something better to say than âI like your mouth'.<span>"<br />
<br />
</span>
</em>
</span>
</li>
<li>If you are an Elvis Presley and have all his albums, keep it to yourself. The only group of people who will be impressed by such information is called â<span>other single men</span>â. Please also donât ever tell her that you can name all the songs ever recorded/sung by Mawi and you even know the words to all of them. The only group of people who will be impressed by such information is called â<span>dorks</span>â.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>She doesnât need to know (yet) that you collect Gundam Toys and Star Wars action figures. Trust me, sheâs not going to go â<em>
<span>Awwâ¦ thereâs a little child inside every man</span>
</em>â. Let her find that out about that later. Much later.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Refrain from using terrible, and unnecessary, motherhood and all-important statements like "<em>
<span>I read that [former CEO of GE) Jack Welch spent 30% of his time on people management. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to make a phone call to London.</span>
</em>" This is a date, not a business meeting.<br />
<br />
</li>
<li>Be aware of the potential pitfalls so that you wonât end up dating chicks with psychopathic tendencies. Watch the movie <em>Fatal Attraction </em>and then look out for the warning signs. For example, if she starts telling you what a bastard her ex was or if she starts suggesting that both of you wear matching colours to your date, Iâd say the prognosis is not exactly sunny. </li>
</ol>
<p>And please, please, please, please, please avoid the following topics: </p>
<ul>
<li>Your hopes and dreams (unless you guys are getting married next week, in which case you why are reading this blog entry again?) </li>
<li>Your job (unless, of course, she asks, but keep your answer short). She doesnât need to know how you designed a new way of testing crude oil viscosity and water content and consequently saved the company millions each month)</li>
<li>Astrology and/or Numerology (what are you? Fifteen?) </li>
<li>The REAL reason why you are so scared of spiders/cats/balloons/ducks </li>
<li>How much you admire Donald Trump </li>
</ul>
<p>Last but not least, use <strong>
<span>The Golden Rule</span>
</strong> when you present yourself and also when you assess the other party: <span>If something sounds too good to be true, it is.</span>
<br />
<br />Will the tips work? I'll be damned if I knew.<br />I wish you all the best of luck.<br />
<br />
