<p>Remember the Sunday morning cartoon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperFriends" title="Never Fear, Wikipedia's Here">Super Friends</a>?  Come on, didn't you love seeing <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/214/1005/640/Wonder%20Woman.jpg" title="Nice Flag!">Wonder Woman</a> and <a href="http://www.newsarama.com/DC/Superman/Kerschl-Superman.jpg" title="He Must Lift Weights">Superman</a> work together in the Hall of Justice?  You just know that with all the movies being made of <a href="http://supermantv.net/fanart/oct/SuperFriends.jpg" title="When Cartoons Come Alive">old television shows</a>, they're going to make <i>Super Friends: The Movie</i>.  So Hollywood casting agents, I've done your job and cast the leads. You're welcome. </p>

<p>Wonder Woman.  Dianne Feinstein. At first, she made us wonder how she was going to vote, then she spun into <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com/multimedia/slideshows/show_324/CVN-CA-FEINSTEIN.jpg" title="Where's the Invisible Plane?">  action</a> and <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=2542" title="When She Makes Up Her Mind, She Really Makes Up Her Mind">voted</a> the way we would hope that the only woman on the committee would.  </p>

<p>Superman. Edward Kennedy. <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/10/915/640/Ted%20Kennedy%20001.jpg" title="Senator, How Fast Do You Run the 60?">Faster</a> than a Karl Rove leak, more <a href="http://bohnsack.com/images/teddy_k.jpg" title="No Cuddly Teddy Bear">powerful</a> than a Tom DeLay golf swing, <a href="http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0202/021102bushgeorgewkennedyted.jpg" title="Able To Fake Smile">able to leap</a> an Arlen Specter chart in a single bound.  Look, there, in the Senate, still, it's <a href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/viewArticle.asp?articleID=2519" title="Teddy Still Rocks">Super Teddy</a>!</p>

<p>Batman and Robin. Chuck Schumer and Dick Durbin. <a href="http://www.internet-esq.com/pp/6794.jpg" title="Does That Make Hillary Batgirl?">Chuck-man</a> and <a href="http://lincoln.motointeractive.net/files/Images/whitehouse-3.jpg" title="One Richard and One Dick">Durbin</a> really are a <a href="http://www.joeacevedo.com/images/figurezone/dcdfigures/dcdbatmanrobin.jpg" title="Double Date Anyone?">dynamic duo</a>.  Bam!  They, along with Senator Kennedy, voted against Roberts in <a href="http://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legislative_issues/federal_issues/hot_issues_in_congress/supreme_court_watch/judiciary-committee-vote.htm" title="A Dynamic Trio">2003</a>.  Ka-pow!  Riddle me this, Batman, how does <a href="http://www.northernstars.ca/actorsabc/Media/carrey_as_riddler.jpg" title="Russ Looks Good In Green">Russ Feingold</a> have the heart and guts to be the first senator to <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/orig/feingold1.html" title="What Happened to This Guy?">speak</a> so eloquently against the war in Iraq and yet votes for Roberts? There's a new member of the Legion of Doom in my comic book.</p>

<p>Aquaman. Joe Biden. Okay, that's a weak one, but there were five main Super Friends and five votes opposing Roberts, so <a href="http://us.news2.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20040929/capt.sge.nxl52.290904223311.photo00.default-380x306.jpg" title="He Will Crush You">Biden</a> gets to be Aquaman. </p>

<p>Sure, they're not movie stars, but at least for today, they were all super heroes.</p>

<p>Oh, and I see Barbara Boxer and John Kerry as the <a href="http://theages.superman.ws/superfriends/panel-3.gif" title="Liberal Powers, Activate!">Wonder Twins</a>.</p>
