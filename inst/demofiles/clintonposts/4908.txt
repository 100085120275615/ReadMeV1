<p>You know the Republican Party has shifted to the far-right when Barry Goldwater starts to <a href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003053350">sound like a liberal</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>An interview in this Sunday&#039;s New York Times Magazine with C.C. Goldwater reveals that her HBO film to be aired Sept. 18 paints her late grandfather, Sen. Barry Goldwater, &#034;as a kind of liberal,&#034; with testimonials from Al Franken, Sen. Ted Kennedy, James Carville and Sen. Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>In fact, Hillary campaigned for Goldwater in 1964 in his race for president against Lyndon Johnson. &#034;Hillary was a Goldwater girl,&#034; says the filmmaker, interviewed by Deborah Solomon. &#034;She passed out cookies and lemonade at his campaign functions.&#034;</p>
<p>Solomon calls Goldwater &#034;a half-Jewish cowboy from Phoenix.&#034;</p>
<p>The film &#8212; made on a budget of $800,000 &#8212; will note that the straight-talking Sen. Goldwater, author of the classic &#034;The Conscience of a Conservative&#034; (soon to be reissued by Princeton University Press) favored abortion rights and allowing gays in the military, and refused to attend President Nixon&#039;s funeral because he &#034;cheated&#034; the country.</p>
<p>In the film, former Washington Post executive editor Ben Bradley calls Sen. Goldwater &#034;an unsung hero of Watergate&#034; for helping convince Nixon to resign.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#039;d also add that Goldwater hated the religious right movement (in 1981, responding to Jerry Falwell&#039;s statement that all good Christians should be concerned about the Supreme Court nomination of Arizonan Sandra Day O&#039;Connor, Goldwater said, &#034;I think every good Christian ought to kick Falwell right in the ass&#034;), didn&#039;t care for Newt Gingrich (Goldwater said he &#034;talks too much&#034;); and snubbed far-right senators like Jesse Helms (whom he described as &#034;off his rocker&#034;).</p>
<p>In 1996, Goldwater joked to Bob Dole, &#034;We&#039;re the new liberals of the Republican Party. Can you imagine that?&#034; As it turns out, yes.
