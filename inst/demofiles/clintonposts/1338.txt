<p><font size="2">As if the beaming mugs of triumphal&nbsp;Bushmen were not enough to bear so soon on the heels of the election, now comes the inevitable Hillary </font><a href="http://www.iht.com/bin/print_ipub.php?file=/articles/2004/11/04/news/hillary.html"><font size="2">talk</font></a><font size="2">. The website Readabet.com&nbsp;lists her as the </font><a href="http://www.readabet.com/index.php/other/article/6337"><font size="2">favorite</font></a><font size="2"> to win the Big&nbsp;House in '08 at 5-1 odds; Rudy Giuliani is second at 15-2.</font></p>
<p><font size="2"><font>I rarely give financial advice at Bush Wars, but personally I'd be comfortable betting against her at those odds. Bush on his&nbsp;most unpopular&nbsp;day has not been as polarizing a figure as Hillary Clinton, and she will never occupy the White House.&nbsp;Her insuperable liability is that she excites an arch reaction from cultural conservatives who suppose her to be liberal and uppity, while she is in fact neither and hence&nbsp;cannot call upon the loyalties of any avid backers to counter her opponents' numbers and zeal. (Here's a side bet you should take as well, if you can find it: She would certainly not win the women's vote. Never mind all the working class women who don't like her; she is not even very popular among white middle-class feminists anymore, as the Village Voice <a href="http://www1.villagevoice.com/issues/0325/lerner.php">reported</a> last year.) Her "base" consists of the most blinkered segment of the Dem intelligentsia, the element that is still&nbsp;bedazzled by Bill or convinced that all the party needs is a star to head its ticket.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2">I'm not sure any of the above fatally injures her chance of being the nominee, however. Look at the field: John "Cat Got My Tongue" Edwards and the rest. Do you suppose Joe Lieberman sees another big opening? &nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</p>
