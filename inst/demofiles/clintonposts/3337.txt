<div>Jeff <a href="http://proteinwisdom.com/index.php?/weblog/entry/20817/">sums it up perfectly</a> at <a href="http://www.proteinwisdom.com/index.php/weblog/">Protein Wisdom</a>, but for those who find his prose a little numbing (donât get me wrong â numbing can be great; it saves on weed), hereâs a precis, soon to be released as a made-for-TV movie entitled âGrumbles, Groans and Gay Marriage: The Andrew Sullivan Sagaâ:<br />
<br />
<span>Once upon a time there was a guy named Andrew Sullivan.  He was gay and that made him different.  Then one day he realized that, amongst his leftist peers, it didnât really make him all that different, because a lot of them were gay, and nobody cared.<br />
<br />So, in order to be different, he announced that he was Catholic, except that he was pro-gay, pro-abortion and pro-birth control.  This didnât leave him much in common with actual Catholics, or in fact with orthodox catholicism writ large.  In fact, short of being more-or-less anti-killing Christ, it didnât leave him very Catholic at all.  But these non-Catholic Catholic beliefs sure gave him lots in common with...his leftist peers.  In fact, too much in common.<br />
<br />So, in order to be different, he announced that he was an Old Fashioned Conservative.  Of course, he didnât believe in small government, minimal government intrusion in peopleâs lives, limiting the power of unions, lowering taxes, increasing military spending, representative democracy, personal responsibility or any of the other things that Old Fashioned Conservatives believed in.  In fact, he pretty much believed what liberals believed â that the role of government is to Regulate Every Single Thing In Every Single Personâs Life.  Which sure gave him lots in common with...his leftist peers.  In fact, too much in common.<br />
<br />So, in order to be different, he decided to support the war to remove Saddam Hussein and bring democracy to Iraq.  This made him different from his leftist peers, except for Joe Lieberman, Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and nearly every other Democrat politician.  Which basically meant that he had, in a burst of radicalism, joined the majority.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>So Andrew went out on a limb and decided to be pro-gay marriage.  But so was everyone else on the left. Which sure gave him lots in common with...his leftist peers.<br />
<br />In fact...too much in common.<br />
<br />So, in order to be different, Andrew decided that the only thing that really mattered was gay marriage, and that being pro-democracy, pro-freedom, pro-small government, pro-victory in war, pro-Western civilization, pro-not kidnapping and butchering people and anti-flying passenger airliners into office towers all had to take a second seat.  So when the President announced that he would not countenance gay marriage, Andrew decided that everything else meant nothing, and that if two gay guys couldnât don matching white polyester tuxedos in some shitty chapel in Vegas and pledge to be blah, blah, blah, then it didnât really matter if Islamofascists were duct-taping pipe bombs to Downâs Syndrome kids, bombing children, flying airplanes into skyscrapers, beheading journalists, kidnapping soldiers or dropping shrapnel rockets on Israeli daycare centers.<br />
<br />This attitude, of course, put him pretty much squarely in the center of the liberals.  But that meant that he wasnât all that different from the rest of the left.  He had...too much in common with his leftist peers.<br />
<br />In the end, he could find no way to make himself different.  So people stopped paying attention to him.  And Andrew sat on his bandwidth and sucked his thumb, wondering whether anyone would ever give ratâs ass about his ludicrous opinions ever again.<br />
</span>
<br />Moral #1:  Believe something important.  Tell people what it is.  Stick by it.  That would be something that just might, at long last, differentiate Sullivan from his leftist peers.<br />
<br />Moral #2:  Sullivan can call himself a conservative until the Sun explodes into a red giant, consumes all life on Earth and collapses into a white dwarf, but it still wonât make him one.  Face it, Andy: if it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and lays eggs like a duck, itâs probably a gay single-issue liberal columnist with a Deimos-sized chip on his shoulder.<br />
<br />Sorry, dude.  You had a brief, shining moment on the right side of history there.  You blew it, and itâs over now.  Accept it and go away.</div>
