<div>Hello Everyone...this is Lowell Thomas reporting, with a red face, from here high in the Himalayas about two important summer anniversaries that slipped past the notepad of this advancing newscaster. First would be the May 29 marking of Sir Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tensing Norgay's incredible assent to the peak of Mount Everest in 1956, a first in mountain quest adventures...then, the marking on July 20 of the Knighted Sir Edmund's birthday in 1919. We salute you Mr. Hillary and all who have attempted to match your historic climb. Until next time, this is Lowell Thomas saying So Long Until Tomorrow.</div>
