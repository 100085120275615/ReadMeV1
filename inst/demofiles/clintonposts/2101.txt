<h2>Liberals Don't Upset Me</h2>
<h3>LEFTISTS, On The Other Hand...</h3>
</center>
<br />
<br />What can I say?  <a href="http://www.forsakethetroops.info/">Forsake The Troops</a>
<br />
<br />Here's the deal, I'm not going to say anything directly about this site. Seriously, why should I? Can't you all just fill in the frikkin' blanks on this one?<br />
<br />But what I'm going to say is this:  I believe there is a dividing line between "liberals" and leftists.<br />
<br />A liberal might support..National Health Care. He might support withdrawing from Iraq, and have opposed going in in the first place. I'm personally none to thrilled with being there myself, but not for the classic liberal reasons. It's the leftist that throw stones at those who serve our country.<br />
<br />Dick Gephardt is a liberal; he wouldn't be down with this site.<br />I doubt Ken Salazar, or Joe Biden or even Bill Clinton would be down. I know what Clinton was doing in the Sixties, but I honestly believe everything he's ever done has been to either get votes or get chicks. And even Kucinich, the one with the Dept. Of Peace, even he I don't think would subscribe to this site. He seems more of the dopey-go-lucky version of a hippie, not the throw blood on servicemen type.<br />
<br />Hillary would be down.  So would Boxer and Feinstein.  Cynthia McKinney would be there too.<br />
<br />So this is the line; the line between liberal and leftist. Now this is the part where Joe Blogger calls on his readers to flood the site and give them what for.<br />
<br />I'm not going to do that.<br />
<br />I don't care if my devoted reader is upset. I'd have a stroke if the folks who think like me don't have conniption fits. I want the liberals who stop by to let me know they're not leftists. I want the folks who blog and would vote for Kerry to say, "Hey..this is just sickening. These people are whackjobs and wrong, and I don't want to be associated with them." I don't think that's much to ask.<br />
<br />That is all.</div>
