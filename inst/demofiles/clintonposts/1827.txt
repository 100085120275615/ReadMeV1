<strong>I made the decision to attempt to post the Blue Star Blog Roll and Icons. The reason for this is simple Conserative Girl's husband, my son-in-law is USAF. Although he is not in Iraq. I believe his job is just as important as anyone's. He is an AWAC mechanic. He is on duty at wierd times. Goes to strange places for extended periods of time.<br />
<br />He also keeps my high maintence drama queen daughter Conserative Girl in check. For that alone he needs a medal of some sort.<br />
<br />He plans on remaining in the USAF as a lifer unless God forbid Hillary is elected. At which time he intends to leave the service. This is a seniment I have heard from all the young folks that are in the military.<br />
<br />However I have strayed from this post. My son-in-law came into our lives 21 years ago as a small child. He is the son of my best friend and used to be partner when I was a cop. His mother past on after battling breast cancer. I was in and out of his life for years. Ya might say on the side lines and just being there.<br />At seven years old Conserative girl and G.I. Man swore they would marry someday. When they were teenagers they hated each other. At about 20 Conserative Girl called said Mom I had a dream I need G.I.'s address. I gotta talk to him. The rest as they say is history.<br />
<br />I think of G.I. as my son. I am proud to call him Son. </strong>
