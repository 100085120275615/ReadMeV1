<span>SAN DIEGO - In his latest effort to defend the ongoing war in Iraq, President Bush today claimed that Saddam Hussein had ties to Hurricane Katrina, the vicious storm that his killed dozens along the Gulf Coast of the US and left the city of New Orleans underwater.<br />
<br />"British intelligence is now reporting that Saddam Hussein has been trying to construct a storm like Katrina for decades," said the President, "we can only imagine how much worse it would have been if he were still loose and able to control it from Baghdad."<br />
<br />While Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice admitted that the US has not found any direct link between Saddam Hussein and Katrina, her statements echoed those of the President: "We do know that Saddam Hussein supports the same cause as Katrina, destruction of the US, and Saddam may well have been trying to provide funds and ammunition for storms like Katrina before he was removed from power."<br />
<br />Word of these new claims was met with skepticism by many across the country, including Congressional Democrats. Former and possibly future presidential candidate John Kerry said, </span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>"Once again this President has got it wrong about Iraq. It's a failed foreign policy with a constantly shifting justification, the lastest of which is this ridiculous claim about an Iraq-Katrina connection." </span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>When asked if that meant we should bring the troops home, Kerry said, "To the contrary, I would put MORE troops in Iraq to defend America and make sure a storm like this never happens again."<br />
<br />With Senator Kerry back in the public eye, the President's dismal approval rating immediately went up by 5 points.<br />
<br />Vice President Cheney even emerged from under a man-hole cover in Washington to lend support to the administration's claims. "I think any rational, honest person who looks at the facts regarding Saddam Hussein will see that he was a brutal dictator, who hated the United States, and definitely wanted the capability - if he didn't already have the capability - to produce large scale hurricanes for the purpose of attacking the US," said Cheney in a calm voice out of the side of his mouth.<br />
<br />Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld was even more direct: "You have a man here who hated the United States, wanted a storm to wipe us off the map, and then Katrina happens. I don't know what more proof you could ask for."</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Unnamed sources in the Whitehouse also claimed that President Clinton's refusal to retaliate militarily against any of the hurricanes of the 1990s may well have emboldened them and led directly to the increase in frequency and intensity of storms hitting the US over the past several years.</span>
