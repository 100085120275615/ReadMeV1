<div>I was just browsing through the Times book review's archive, which I've always noted for it's self-indulgent and uninformative solliloquies posing as book reviews. But it's still hard to believe some of the stuff they take seriously there. I'm beginning to feel more and more that this is a slanderous, petty, and borderline idiotic institution. For instance, from the review of the Hillary Clinton biography: <blockquote>
<p>Monica Lewinsky is fat. Bill Clinton has long been a member of the clean-plate society. Evelyn Lieberman, the former White House deputy chief of staff, is reputed to be ''a little overweight.'' Mrs. Clinton herself has long battled a tendency to beef up, but in perhaps the most astonishing revelation in the book, ''several of her Wellesley College classmates, who played sports with Hillary, described how she looked in a T-shirt and shorts,'' and according to them, ''she had a tiny waist, slim legs and ankles, and small buttocks.'' When coupled with the fact that the young Hillary Clinton was referred to by classmates as ''Sister Frigidaire,'' and by White House staff as ''the Big Girl,'' and that Hillary's tubby husband Bill gave a high-level position to Janet Reno, the implication is clear. Hillary Clinton does not merely view the world through the asexual, unmaternal, left-leaning eyes of a poorly groomed woman who was surrounded in her youth by manipulative pinkos who were playing for the other team. At some level, Hillary Clinton feels most comfortable in the company of fat people.<br />
</p>
<p>The obvious conclusion is that Hillary Clinton, in a ploy of Machiavellian subtlety, deliberately overcame her small buttocks and thin ankles and put on a few pounds in a cunning attempt to curry favor with fat voters. And in a nation that is looking increasingly chunky, this alone could insure her victory in the 2008 presidential elections.<br />
</p>
<p>Are there any other revelations in the book that are worthy of note? Yes...</p>
</blockquote>Copied verbatim. You did not misread that; it is being seriously suggested that this insight is "worthy of note," however that's supposed to be taken. If by worthy of note it is meant "off-base, trite and worthy of the interest of the tabloid community" then I would agree. As much as I would love to have a great paper based out of New York to read every day, it is clear that this paper is filled with too many idling narcissists who have nothing important or useful to say. For the most part, the book review is really like a navel-gazing club consisting of people who have written stupid books themselves editorializing on the most recent stupid books of others.<br />
<br />Note: This doesn't apply to the actual reporting, which still is probably the best out there (not that I read very many newspapers).  The problem there isn't in the quality of the reporting, it's in what they choose to report on. Most choices are absolutely transparent in respect to serving an agenda intended to promote and champion their version of "New York Values," whatever these are presumed to be at the moment. So it's a good news source, it's just an incomplete news scource.<br />
<br />The other trouble is, anyone can write a good article and still not include most of the facts. The Times is a master at this, the article on Israel cited a few paragraphs below being a perfect example. At any rate, none of this compares to their non-factual content: editorials, book reviews, etc. - which can be truly obnoxious.<br />
<br />Not to single out the Times. News media in general are on a steady decline. I for one find reading political editorials more painful than listening to the politicians themselves spin the realities and rail on each other. Investigative journalism (you know, where they actually visit places and find out things other networks haven't already covered) is fast becoming a wistful thing of the past. With the exception of maybe CNN, belonging to a side, with all the all the intellectual dishonesty and partisan acrimony this entails, has become the rule. I am aware of the argument that "Bush and his partisan cronies have caused this." I seriously doubt this. But even if it is true, it turns out that things are even more regretable than they seem. This is simply because even with all of its left-leaning tendencies intact, the news media have done a truly risible job of covering and printing the stories that could have fatally exposed Bush's failings. The press loved the Clinton fiasco, whoever goes down in the process be damned, but because the Bush White House is much better a covering up and containing incriminating information, we heard about the CIA outing scandal for about a week. I find it hard to believe that huge conglomerations and corporate ownership interests alone account for this phenomenon.<br />
<br />Update / rebuttal: But the Times does investigative work on the most important things, like when it tried to unseal private documents regarding nominee Judge Roberts' adoption records. This is so idiotic. What could the paper possibly think it could gain from this? 1) Not that I'm experienced in this matter, but I would guess that soliciting access to a non-incorporated individual's private records on a matter such as adoption is neither acceptable nor feasible. Regarding at least one of the personal attorneys for Roberts, "Sources familiar with the matter tell <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_News" title="Fox News">FOXNEWS</a> that at least one lawyer turned the TIMES down flat, saying that any effort to pry into adoption case records, which are always sealed, would be reprehensible." 2) If the Times were able to obtain the documents without attracting public attention and censure, and was able to print the findings, the story itself would have been at best laughed at as a frivolous piece of wasted resources and at worst lambasted by its readers - although one never knows with these New Yorkers. 3) Normally, when a newspaper sanctions investigative inquiries into a topic of interest, it has certain findings of interest in mind. I'm finding it very difficult to infer what those findings are in such a case, which deals with the circumstances and motivations surrounding two adoptions.</div>
