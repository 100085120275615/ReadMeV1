That's all fine and good if you're uneducated and ignorant of the many deficiencies of the English-language.<br />
<br />Barry Goldwater was (always) a "classical liberal" or what I and many like me would call a libertarian. He was hawk on defense and believed in a small, but efficient government. After that, you're on your own and it's none of anybody's business. The Democrats like to pretend they have something in common with Goldwater due to his stand on abortion and gays in the military, but that's where it ends. Goldwater and the modern Democratic Party have almost nothing in common, and trying to make it seem otherwise is dishonest and disgusting.(Hat tip: <a href="http://www.hotair.com/">Hot Air</a>)<br />

<br />
<blockquote>Goldwater said he knew the Vietnam War would be one of the major issues in the campaign, and called on President Lyndon Johnson to do what was necessary to win. He made his views on the war clear then and 25 years later when appearing on CNN's "Larry King Live."   <p>"If I had inherited the mess that Johnson got into, I would have said to North Vietnam, by dropping leaflets out of B-52s, 'You quit the war in three days or the next time these babies come over there going to drop some big bombs on you.' And I'd make a swamp out of North Vietnam ... I'd rather kill a hell of a lot of North Vietnamese than one American and we've lost enough of them," Goldwater said.</p>
