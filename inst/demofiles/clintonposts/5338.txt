Hillary voted for an amendment yesterday telling George Bush that mindlessly <a href="http://intellectualize.org/archives/008196.html">staying the course</a> in Iraq isn't good enough for our troops or our country.  Some horrible insight into the Republican mind is gained by watching their reaction.  Apparently trying to change course when the current course results in dozens of deaths a day is "flip flopping."  I'm pretty sure guys like these were navigating the Titanic.
