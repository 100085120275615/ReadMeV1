<div>In 1993 I was outraged when I heard that a landowner in North Carolina was losing the right to use his land because a so-called âEndangered Northern Spotted Owlâ had been seen on his land. (The âNorthernâ spotted owl is the same as all the other spotted owls in the U.S., but by calling it a âNorthernâ owl the environmentalists could classify it as a âNewâ species that had very few around, so therefore it was âendangeredâ).<br />
<br />Because of the fake status of the owl The Endangered Species Act (ESA) kicked in and this landowner was told he could not touch his trees, his land or his surrounding pond because this was now âhabitatâ for the once-seen âendangeredâ owl.<br />
<br />When this landowner was told that he could no longer log on the land that his family had owned for over 100 years he did the only smart thing--he clear cut the entire area outside of the âprotectedâ area. The whacko environmentalists went nuts but the landowner did the right thing. He protected HIS habitat from the chance a stray âendangeredâ owl would land on his property. He was protecting his property rights.<br />
<br />After this incident I formed an organization called <em>CEPAN: Control The EPA Now</em>. The sole purpose of CEPAN was to educate the public and political types of the danger of the EPA, the ESA and the environmental movement in general.<br />
<br />Needless to say I was not well received in many quarters.<br />
<br />I visited college campuses and when I was at Villanova University, where I got my graduate degree in Political Science and History, I was yelled at and had a pinecone thrown at me because I was handing out a fact sheet of the current excesses of the environmental movement and how it was threatening property rights.<br />
<br />I actually had a student tell me that, âThere should be no property rights because the environment is more important and the greater good means more than some rich personâs land and mansion.â When I told her she was advocating a Communistic land policy she was glad. She smiled and actually enjoyed that thought.<br />
<br />But that IS the point of the environmental movement. To achieve through the courts and the laws what people of the country will not vote for--the Communist land use ideas that have failed everywhere they are tried.<br />
<br />I call these people <strong>Watermelons</strong>---they are green on the outside and red on the inside. And these fruits are winning.<br />
<br />In 1993 I was looked at as an extremist at a college meeting when I said that the ESA was the first step in taking private property from people for any government use. I was told by one professor at Temple University that I was a scaremonger and that nothing I was saying about property rights being in danger was true or would ever happen.<br />
<br />Last week I was proved right on all counts.<br />
<br />The United States Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 that governments can seize PRIVATE property for government use if the land could be better used economically by the <strong>government's choice</strong> of a private owner than by the <strong>current</strong> private landowner.<br />
<br />Read that again:<br />
<br />The <strong>GOVERNMENT</strong> can <em>SEIZE</em> <strong>PRIVATE</strong> property for <strong>GOVERNMENT</strong> use if the land could <em>better</em> be used economically by the <strong>GOVERNMENT's CHOICE OF A PRIVATE OWNER</strong> than by the <strong>CURRENT</strong> <strong>PRIVATE </strong>landowner.<br />
<br />So your house becomes a Walmart if the town wants it to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>
<span>This is the end of property rights as we know it.<br />
<br />This is the end of the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.<br />
<br />This is the start of the liberal land seize they have wanted since the 1930âs. </span>
</strong>
<br />
<strong>

</strong>
<br />The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution states:<br />
<em>ânor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation.â</em>
<br />
<br />This is known as the â<strong>Takings Clauseâ</strong>, and it is a key way to tell if someone is a Liberal or a Conservative. If I had a dollar for every time I was told in political discussions that the Takings Clause, âdoesnât really existâ, I could buy the Supreme Court. (And get rid of the 5 Liberals who ruled this way).<br />
<br />Liberals hate the Takings Clause because it has always prevented them from expanding government where they want it to go. That pesky âjust compensationâ line has always stopped them. Taxpayers donât want to pay market rates for land that government deems needed for yet another park âfor the childrenâ.<br />
<br />To get around this liberal judges have ruled in cases that if the government tells a beachfront landowner that he canât build those 5 houses he wants to because he might disturb the environment, that is <em>
<strong>not</strong>
</em> a âtakingâ, because they never actually <em>took</em> the land from the owner, they just told him he canât use it.<br />
<br />See how liberals use dishonesty and the courts to get what we the people would never vote for?<br />
<br />Now they want us to trust them with the definition of âjust compensationâ for homeowners?<br />
<br />But that <strong>IS</strong> the problem. The âjust compensationâ idea has been trampled on for the last 20 years by the Endangered Species Act and now will be transferred to local and State government interpretation of what is a âjustâ price for private property.<br />
<br />That is like having the IRS decide how much of your income you really need and how much the government should have.<br />
<br />We have now given the government the power to decide if your property is worthwhile.<br />
<br />The Supreme Court case was brought by a Connecticut town that wanted to tear down peopleâs houses that were <strong>NOT</strong> condemned. The town said that these homes were in the way of a new drug plant Pfizer Co. wanted to build. The Court ruling now means that the taxes that Pfizer will pay are more important than the homes and land these people have owned for centuries. They will get only a fraction of what the Victorian Homes are worth while the city gets more revenue to go after more land and homes.<br />
<br />Soviet Union land management anyone?<br />
<br />But the ruling means more than just homes and land belong to the State now.<br />As we speak lawyers for the ACLU and other anti-religion groups are working with governments to mandate that CHURCHES are not paying enough in taxes so the government gets the land for a new Costco. I am not making this up. This is happening right now.<br />
<br />Thanks to the liberal Supreme Court.<br />
<br />This massive land grab by the anti-property rights extremists all started in the 1970âs with expanding Zoning laws and Homeowners Associations, both of which are now totally out of control.<br />
<br />Donât believe me?<br />
<br />A few years ago a homeowner in California was told that his house was âtoo whiteâ. The other people in the area complained that the sun reflected off his house and was âannoyingâ them. The local government ORDERED the homeowner to repaint the house at his expense. He did.<br />
<br />He painted an American Flag on the side of his house.<br />
<br />Heâs my hero.<br />
<br />Now this Supreme Court ruling has painted a <strong>Hammer And Sickle</strong> on the backside of the U.S. Constitution.<br />
<br />A friend wrote me after he saw the ruling,<br />
<em>âThis ruling, more than anything else that has happened recently, scares me deeply that the USA is headed down the road toward Socialism and outright collapse. Property rights are a cornerstone of democracy and American rights. I guess the common individual isnât crap compared to Big Government or Big Developers. Can you believe the DEMOCRAT Supreme Court judges pushed this through?â</em>
<br />
<br />Actually I can.<br />
<br />I predicted it years ago.<br />
<br />Now President Bush must appoint the most far-right wing Supreme Court justice he can so we can overturn this ruling as more cases of government abuse occur and lawsuits become rampant.<br />
<br />My choice is Ted Olsen, who is an adamant believer in property rights and is a brilliant conservative lawyer. But the liberals in the Senate hate him with a passion and have warned Bush not to appoint people like him to the Supreme Court. That is why this summerâs Supreme Court nomination fights will be the political show of the decade.<br />
<br />Ted Kennedy, Hillary Clinton and the other liberals in the Senate who love this horrible ruling can scream all they want about they having the right to decide who is on the Supreme Court. But this ruling has shown them for what they really are:<br />
<br />Land Grabbing, Big Government , Socialistic Extremists.<br />
<br />The Democrat party and the Liberals say they care about the little guy, but they just screwed all the little people that have private property and did it in the name of government âpublicâ interest.<br />
<br />In Matworld private property rights are guaranteed and not to be tread upon by anyone.<br />And if I want to paint purple polka dots and the NASCAR logo on the side of my house I should be allowed to do it. Because I am the owner, not the government.<br />
<br />That was true until last week.<br />
<br />Grab your home and land titles and hang on tight.<br />You may need them soon.<br />
