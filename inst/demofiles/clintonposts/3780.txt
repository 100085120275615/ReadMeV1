<b>Three Old Knitting Pattern Booklets</b>, $0.05/ea. <br />A Festival of Sweaters! It sounds like the sort of event that would have Rebecca and I whipped into all a frenzy. I hope there'd be funnel cake and kettle corn. <br />

<br />
<b>Lots of Green Embroidery Cotton, a Pair of 10.5 Needles</b>, $0.25 for the cotton, $0.50, the needles. <br />Not much to say about this. I always buy metal knitting needles when I find them, so I can color coordinate my project to the needles. <br />

<b>Martha Stewart Living, Holiday 1994/1995</b>, free! <br />It was in the free magazine pile outside the shop. I wonder what it's been doing for the past eleven years. <br />

<br />
<b>Old Wesson Oil Measuring Cup</b>, $0.50. <br />I love old promo objects like this. I found a Wesson mayonnaise maker when I lived in CO years ago, but, since I don't really like mayonnaise, never used it. It disappeared into the moving vortex. <br />
<br />Total: $1.40. <br />
<br />Oh, and the shop was having a bag sale the day I was there...<br />
