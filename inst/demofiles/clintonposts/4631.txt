<p>It's hot.  It is really hot here.
Not <em>quite</em> as hot as in New York City, allegedly, but still there are reports that it has unofficially hit 100&deg;F in "downtown" Provincetown.
Apart from some morning swims we have kept Frisket inside most of the day, much to her chagrin.</p>
<p>Tonight we plan to see <cite>Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest</cite> at the <a href="http://wellfleetcinemas.com/">Wellfleet Drivein</a>, keeping up our tradition of seeing a Johnny Depp movie at the drive in (last year was <cite>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</cite>)</p>
<p>I finished <cite>Ender's Game</cite> and zipped through <cite>The Talmud and the Internet: A Journey between Worlds</cite>.
I thought I'd read it before, but hadn't, now that I have, it's not what I thought it was.  
It's more of a meditation on the talmud with occasional correlations drawn to the 1990s internet, but it's not the in-depth study I thought it was (apologies to Alex).</p>
<p>I think a follow-up book should be written: <cite>The Talmud and the Wikipedia</cite>.</p>
<p>After an argument with my late mother, I stopped posting and writing about politics here.
I'm going to break with that and call everyone's attention to a mid-summer move by Senator Arlen Spector to bless the administration's spying on U.S. citizens.

The argument that the only people who <q>need to fear</q> are those who are doing something wrong is facetious: another bill pending in the Congress pretty much authorizes the President to designate anyone as an enemy combatant and strip that person of all civil rights: no courtroom, no prosecution,  no judge, no jury, no defense.  
To those who would retort back: <q>Again, the only ones who need to be concerned are those who mean us ill, and we trust the President to determine that</q>, I <em>retort</em> would you trust President Clinton (either past or future) to make that determination?
I suspect not.</p>
