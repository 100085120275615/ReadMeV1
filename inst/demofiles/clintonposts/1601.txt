Here&#8217;s the incumbency rates over the <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~d.a.n/IncumbentsGraph2004Nov.gif" rel="nofollow"><b>last 50 years.</b></a><br />
There may have been periods of much higher anti-incumbent sentiment than now (e.g. 1952, 1958, 1966, 1976, 1980, 1986, 1992, 1992).<br />
But, <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~d.a.n/IncumbentsGraph2006Nov.gif" rel="nofollow"><b>here is what we need &#8230; </b></a><br />
A number of things are really tickin&#8217; off the voters, and bought-and-paid-for incumbent politicians are largely responsible for it.  Still, voters are easy to fool, and they may need to experience a lot more pain and misery before they even feel like bothering to vote, much less vote out irresponsible incumbent politicians.   </p>
<p>I shudder to think of Hillary Clinton as president, but is it really that important anymore, with the bar set so low<b>?</b> Can it get much worse<b>?</b>  That is, we may already be too far down the wrong path<b>?</b>  Our problems are most likely to the point where they will start solving themsevles, the hard way, regardless of what we do.</p>
