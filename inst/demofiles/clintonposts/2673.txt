<div><p>A good friend of ours has gone home to France for his sister's wedding, and I was desperately trying to put together some things for his two nieces and nephew.&nbsp; Their mum sends me French magazines so I wanted to send her some stuff in return.&nbsp; I feel I should really make something for her, but I don't know her so it's kind of difficult to figure out what to make, and kids are so easy...</p>

<p>It did spur me on to finally finish the <a href="http://www.knitty.com/ISSUEspring05/PATTtrellis.html">Trellis</a> cardi, and I'm so happy with the way it turned out.&nbsp; I knitted it up over one weekend, and used the Rowan All Seasons cotton in the <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/NEW-for-2006-Rowan-All-Seasons-Cotton-CASSIS-Singles_W0QQitemZ320004961317QQihZ011QQcategoryZ75569QQtcZphotoQQcmdZViewItem">Cassis colourway bought from Janette</a> on ebay.&nbsp; Finally got around to getting some little wooden buttons, and this should be great for the smallest niece.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I have a feeling I'll be making this again, and next time I'll switch the cabling so it's mirror imaged (I'm sure you know what I mean).&nbsp; I would have done that this time if I'd thought of it.&nbsp; The All Seasons cotton is great - feels so soft, machine washable, and doesn't dry ones hands out as cotton is prone to do.&nbsp; Double thumbs up.</p>

<p>My plans fell over when it came to the oldest niece.&nbsp; She's 6, so I decided to make her a softie.&nbsp; Which one?&nbsp; So many to choose from, and so little decision making capability.&nbsp; Alas my deadline passed, but I've finally made a decision.&nbsp; The <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/">&quot;Put together booklet No. 1&quot;</a> has been ordered from <a href="http://www.weewonderfuls.com/">Hillary</a>, <a href="http://www.achildsdream.com/handwork_supplies/felting_crafts/holland_wool_felt.htm">wool felt</a> has been arranged, fabrics selected, and I'll be eagerly awaiting the postman so I can get one of them sewn up and a parcel sent before I lose momentum again.</p></div>
