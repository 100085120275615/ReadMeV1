<div>The Dumbacratic National Committee sunk the moderate battleship in their party. Just a few years ago Joe Lieberman stood before the country and WON them an election (err, popular vote). In the meantime, after having lost control of all arms of government they have abandoned conventional wisdom (do what works) for even further liberal opportunism.<br />
<br />The party, like the mantis, has officially started attacking its beloved. No longer is it just the old "he shouldn't run" and "he should succumb to the will of the voters in the<em> primary</em>" to now more vicious and malevolent statements. "He's no democrat" and "he's a fox news democrat." Meanwhile, on his web site he calls himself a strong on defense democrat. Earth to Lieberman, no you are not!!!<br />
<br />Like politics as of late, his web site showcases himself and some positions but no one around. Kind of like where his party left him. Look around yourself Joe! I see nothing but Republicans.<br />
<br />The day of the fateful election Lieberman's web site was hacked which some assumed was the LAMEont camp. Lieberman referred to the tactic as "Rovian." Meanwhile, the Republicans are the ones who have come to support Lieberman despite their differences. Lieberman, however, despite having to run in the general election as an independent still refers to himself as a democrat and that is sad.<br />
<br />When Shaq got traded to the Heat did he still refer to himself as a Laker?<br />
<br />The ascent to insanity is the left wing of the Dumbacratic party. The behind the scenes socialists who seldom talk issues and have euphemistic phraseology for each idea they support believes they have won an epic battle when in fact it was only a primary. The Dumbacratic party, vis a vi the left wing have in essence lost their marbles. Lieberman is a man who is a winner in their party. I don't understand why you would take your parties Scotty Pippen out of the game when your not gaining ground anywhere else.<br />
<br />Lieberman is a slam dunk - not a benchwarmer.<br />
<br />The ascent of the far left to the parties main stream is the reason Hillary will be the most attractive (not literally, financially) candidate for '08. For years I have called out liberals asking why they don't come out and just say who they are and what they stand for. Maybe this is what I was afraid of? But actually, when I tell the Democrats to separate from the liberals within their ranks I'm only trying to help. Ned LAMEont may represent your far left views but exposing yourself will only alienate voters.<br />
<br />So I was wrong. Your better off keeping your head buried in the sand.</div>
