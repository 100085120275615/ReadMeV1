<p>What&#8217;s this?Â  Bin Laden&#8217;s terrorist group has managed to botch yet another attack?</p>
<p>The lame Hezbollah terrorist group has now become the biggest threat in the World.</p>
<p>Suggetion to Al Qaeda.Â  FireÂ  your boss.Â Â  He sucks.Â  Wait no.Â  That won&#8217;t help.Â  Wait until a Democrat becomes President to attempt your next attack.Â  In the best case scenario hope Hillary Clinton becomes the next President - Despite her husband being a great President he sucked on the entire preventing terrorist attacks part.</p>
<p>Serious.Â  It&#8217;s pretty bad when even the British can foil your plans.Â  You suck.</p>
<p>PS We don&#8217;t want Osama Bin Laden anymore.Â  Too much bad luck seems to follow him around.
