<p>If you hang around ATS for a short while â especially the Aliens and UFOs forum â youâll be well aware of the Reptilian alien species and the fact that theyâre living amongst us in human disguises.</p>

 <br />
Let me just state for the record that I do believe in intelligent life other than that on planet earth. (Although sometimes I have strong doubts about the intelligence of life on this planet, but thatâs beyond the point.)<br />
 <br />
But every time I hear the word Reptilian I want to tap someone on the shoulder and say, âDude, you havenât been wearing your Tinfoil Hat, have you!?â. <br />
I donât mind people with strange and wacky ideas. It makes life really interesting â not to mention funny. I listen to their theories, smile, shake my head and walk away. But I canât help but laugh out loud when I hear the Reptilian storiesâ¦</p>
        <p>According to Tinwiki:<br />
<em><strong>Reptilian humanoids are intelligent, supernatural, or highly developed reptile-like humanoids in mythology, popular fiction, and speculative fringe theories. They also appear in some conspiracy theories, most notably those of David Icke, and in science fiction. Some authors refer to them as reptoids, dinosauroids or lizardmen.</strong></em><br />
 <br />
Now âDavid Ickeâ should already make the red light go â<em>Weeow-Weeow</em>â. (I mean can you take anyone serious with the surname Icke? And how do you respect anyone that says heâs the âson of Godâ?)<br />
I can understand humanoids in mythology. Weâve got the strangest beings in Mythology. I mean, even Christianity has its fair share of strange beingsâ¦ <br />
Reptilians in fiction? I would expect nothing less.<br />
Then the rest explains it allâ¦ Speculative (tentative, âifâ) fringe (extreme) theories (presumption, guess). Now that a lot of âifâsââ¦<br />
 <br />
Letâs take a quick look at what exactly a reptilian is supposed to be: <br />
Theyâre all the way from the planet Draco. They walk erect and appear to be human, living not only on the planets they come from, but also in caverns and tunnels under the earth. They have crossbred with humans, which has created "hybrids" who are "possessed" by the full-blooded reptilians. The reptiles' hybrid reptilian-human DNA allows them to change from reptilian to human form if they consume human blood.<br />
 <br />
Oh, and they reportedly wear hoods. <br />
 <br />
Uhmâ¦ Yeah. Sounds to me like the story of Little Red Riding Hood was all wrongâ¦ Lilâ Red Riding Hood was actually a Reptilian, she ate her Grandma, then blamed it on a wolf. (Why do wolves always get picked on?!) She then started a small group called the Illuminati where sheâs the Queen reptilian that rules the entire planet.<br />
(See anyone can theorise. And itâs a pretty good theory, even if I have to say so myself.) <br />
 <br />
Now, up to this stage itâs just another conspiracy theory. Nothing wrong with that. But when it comes to theories, I say, show me the proof. And these guys have proof, make no mistake!<br />
 <br />
They present to us modern day, real-life Reptilians. Donât laugh, Iâm dead serious! Like the Queens dearly departed mother. (Bless her soul) George W. Bush and the lap dogâ¦ Err, I mean Tony Blair. (Now if these two are reptilians, we donât have much to fear. I think intelligence is more or less important if you want to rule the world from behind the curtains. And if Mr Bush and Mr Blair is samples of Reptilians, they canât be that intelligent of a race. So much for Intelligent Extra-Terrestrial Life?) Hillary Clinton. (That would explain why she wasnât really bothered when her husband âdid not have sexual relationsâ with âthat womanââ¦) Not to forget Mr Walt Disney. Poisoning our minds of singing mice in red pants, and flying elephants! <br />
 <br />
Now, if you dig a little deeper, youâll find that the whole British family is actually Reptilians, and that Princess Diana was killed because it came to her attention that Charles and Camillaâs child (when was Camilla pregnant again?) was sacrificed in a satanic ritual. Now this makes complete sense. If you want to rule the world itâs a great idea to sacrifice your own offspring to Lucifer. You know. Get the âDark Lordâ on your sideâ¦<br />
 <br />
Now thatâs some convincing stuff! <br />
What do you mean itâs not? OK, OKâ¦ Letâs look at some more evidence.<br />
Letâs here from Mr Icke (LoLâ¦ Sorry, I canât help it. Every time I hear that surname I laughâ¦) himself. (From Our Reptilian Brain.)<br />
 <br />
<em>"For those who, understandably, find even the idea of a reptilian race to be unimaginable, never mind the shape-shifting, </em></p>

<p>Not at all... We've heard crazier stories!</p>

<p><em>I repeat the words of cosmologist Carl Sagan: "There are more potential combinations of DNA [physical forms] than there are atoms in the universe." Far from it being impossible for such a race to emerge, it would be more surprising if it had not.â</em><br />
 <br />
Uh-uhâ¦ So where are they? Never mind. Letâs move on.<br />
 <br />
<em>âStudies have suggested that if the dinosaurs had survived, and some may have done so within the Earth, they would have evolved a reptilian humanoid form by now.â</em><br />
 <br />
Studies suggestedâ¦? Wow. It wouldnâve been even better if they actually proved it, and not just suggested itâ¦ Oh waitâ¦ Some dinosaurs did survive. Crocodiles. Ahâ¦ I see. They didnât feel like evolving into shape-shifting, humanoid forms. Fine, letâs go on.<br />
 <br />
 <em>âHe evolved the Troodon dinosaur in line with genetic changes over millions of years and created a model of a being he called a dino?sauroid. It was a reptilian humanoid and identical to those that abductees and others have claimed to see.â</em> </p>

<p>Oh, only the Troodon dino? Sorry, my mistake. Who is this weâre talking about, by the way? God? I mean he has the ability to create a model that predicts how a dino would have evolved over millions of years. Not? Dale Russell, the senior palaeontologist at North Carolina Universityâ¦ Oh, well, I guess he knows what heâs doing. I mean, nature is actually a bit predictable, so itâs easy to predict how something would evolve over millions of years. Pity these Troodons didnât survive to prove Dale Russell right. They did? Well, Iâll be!<br />
 <br />
<em>âCredo Mutwa and others say that reptilians, originated on this planet and were driven off before returning to claim what they believe is rightfully theirs.â</em><br />
 <br />
Wait, wait! You lost me now. You say that Troodons DID evolve to reptilians, but they were driven away by some big bully? I wonder where the reptilians went when they were chased offâ¦ And how they got away? Wait. Whatâs that? Mr Icke (LoL!) doesnât agree with another crazy personâ¦ Errâ¦ Conspiracy theorist?<br />
 <br />
<em>âMaybe, maybe not. We only have their word for that and their word does not seem to be worth a lot.â</em><br />
 <br />
Well, well. I think Mr Icke is a bit of a hypocrite? HIS word is good but not the other guys on the bandwagon? Thatâs not nice, Mr Icke. Play nice!<br />
 <br />
<em>"At least five human behaviours originate in the reptilian brain ... Without defining them, I shall simply say that in human activities they find expression in: obsessive compulsive behaviour; personal day-to-day rituals and superstitious acts; slavish conformance to old ways of doing things; ceremonial re-enactments; obeisance to precedent, as-in legal, religious, cultural, and other matters....and all manner of deceptions.â</em><br />
 <br />
You didnât follow that either, did you? Yeah, see Mr Icke likes to use âbig wordsâ in order to confuse and/or impress the reader. Letâs see what heâs saying: Heâs saying that Reptilians in human form shows these attributes: <br />
 <br />
1. They are obsessive compulsive i.e. they wash their hands a lot, they would pace a room, they tend to count things, things should be neat and orderly. <br />
2. They have personal day-to-day rituals and superstitious actsâ¦ Oh my word. Half the people I know are reptilians! I might even be one myselfâ¦ See, Iâve got âpersonal day-to-day ritualsâ like brushing my teeth after breakfast in the morning, kissing my better half before I eat dinner, playing a round of cards before I go to sleepâ¦ And superstitious actsâ¦ I donât want to walk under ladders and feel uncomfortable when a black cat cross my path. I even throw salt over my shoulder when I spill saltâ¦<br />
3. Slavish conformance to old ways of doing thingsâ¦ My Dad may be a Reptilianâ¦ Heâs conservative!<br />
4. Ceremonial re?enactments? I thought itâs called theatre?<br />
5. Obeisance to precedent, as?in legal, religious, cultural, and other matters. Obeisance â Bob/bow. Precedent â Guide/model. What the hell? I donât even know what that means?!<br />
Well, basically Mr Icke is saying our psychiatric hospitals are full of Reptilians, and the rest of them are somehow related to me.<br />
 <br />
Well, Iâm going to move on, but you can get some more hard-core proof from Mr. Icke himself right here: <br />
<a href="http://blog.abovetopsecret.com/gemwolf/ http://www.2012.com.au/reptilian_brain.html" target="_blank"> http://www.2012.com.au/reptilian_brain.html</a><br />
 <br />
I rest my caseâ¦ Not? What do you mean youâre not convinced yet? Physical proof? Oh, weâve got lots and lots of those!<br />
 <br />
Weâve got many pictures that undeniably show a âglitchâ in the Reptilian shape-shift. Yes, Reptiliansâ disguise would sometimes morph uncontrollably and reveal their real identities in front of the cameras!<br />
 <br />
<a href="http://www.reptilianagenda.com/img/pics/Diana.jpg" target="_blank"> Exhibit A</a><br />
<a href="http://www.reptilianagenda.com/img/pics/Exposed.jpg" target="_blank"> Exhibit B</a><br />
 <br />
We can also add a couple of filters to any picture of a reptilian and it will reveal their true form.</p>

<p>Or what am I saying Mr. Bush? <br />
<a href="http://j-walkblog.com/old/images/clizardbushitis.jpg" target="_blank"> Exhibit C</a><br />
 <br />
This one of Mr David Rockefeller even have some nice descriptions and pointers to point out the obvious Reptilian features.<br />

 <br />
And can we forget the ultimate proof we had right here on ATS? The video of the Queen where she clearly shifted shapes right in front of our eyes!<br />
<a href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread204650/pg1" target="_blank">Video Evidence! The Queen is really a reptilian!!!!</a><br />
 <br />
And then, this morning I got some more proof. A Thomas left a comment on my âJohnny Depp is not Human â Part 1â blog entry.<br />
 <br />
<em>Depp is a reptoid.  He shifted all over POTC. <br />
<a href="http://blog.abovetopsecret.com/gemwolf/ http://photos1.blogger.com/img/104/1532/640/04-10-18%20Depp%20Shift.jpg" target="_blank">http://photos1.blogger.com/img/104/1532/640/04-10-18%20Depp%20Shift.jpg</a></em> </p>

<p>And that is all I have to say about Reptiliansâ¦ No, wait. One more thing. Thomas, my friend. Hereâs some advice for you:<br />
1. Get someone to help you fold a new tinfoil hat. Yours is broken and the mind-control rays are coming through.<br />
2. Stop smoking whatever it is youâre smoking.<br />
3. Be ware of what accusations you throw Johnny Deppâs wayâ¦ His fans are dangerous.</p>
