<p>I still enjoy taking a peek at the New York Post - online edition - periodically. It reminds me of my ties to the East Coast; growing up in Jersey City, taking the PATH train to the WTC stop and walking to shops and the Village. The East Coast has a bit of an edge all its own, and I enjoy reliving it a bit. The Post does a good job of capturing the 'taste' of the NY metro area.</p>

<p>Part of the Post that I read is the gossip section. I like reading about the New York style nightlife that is found no where else. CBGB's, the Plaza, SoHo and Tribeca, it reminds me of growing up across the Hudson and how that scene spawned so much good music and fabulous shows.</p>

<p>I like the Post, even though we mostly read the Daily News when I was a kid. The Post is a bit more even, a little less judgmental, a little less liberal. </p>

<p>Every once in a while, even in the gossip sections, you can find a gem. This time it's courtesy of Cindy Adams, as she expounds on what the Fourth of July means.</p>

<p>It's a great piece, something our much aggrieved and put upon Representatives in Congress would do well to think about. It's about something I've mentioned in the past- sacrifice.</p>

<p>The fats cats preening themselves in the beltway know little of it. They don't know about standing up for America and giving up a profitable career in order to defend her ideals, they don't know about risking their lives, homes and wealth on a long shot. All they know about is how to trade morals for expediency that will ensure the continuation of their legacy and guarantee that their special interest groups won't stray during the next election cycle. They know about perks they enjoy for being a public 'servant', they know about fawning all over lawbreakers in order to garner a few more future votes (and damn principle!), and they know about lucrative pensions that await them when they leave public office. </p>

<p>If the chips were down, how many of them could we rely on to defy the world, to defy bin Laden and risk their lives so that a free America would be preserved for future generations? Very few, since most of them seem to be content to live in the here and now, crippled by their myopic view, seen through the prism of political benefit. The continued ascendence of their party supercedes all; this is particularly true among Democrats, although President Bush has displayed this as well, particuarly on the issue of illegal immigration.</p>

<p>So here we are, mired in the stye of our political system, which is a mere shade of that envisioned by the men who signed a document two hundred and thirty years ago and then had to flee for their lives.</p>

<p>Cindy Adams, from the NY Post today:</p>

<p><em><strong>SPIRIT OF U.S.A. ENDURES ALWAYS</strong></em></p>

<p><em>June 28, 2006 -- I'M thinking July 4. I'm thinking 1776. I'm thinking patriotism. I'm thinking when all Americans were united in loving and supporting their country. </p>

<p>WWII. 1942. A True Story magazine article headed "Movie Stars Honor and Serve Our Country." It featured Pvt. Mickey Rooney, who took basic at Fort Riley, Kan., and was in the European theater of operations. Besides latrine and KP duties like everyone else, he did jokes for the guys like, "You know what a troop train is? A bunch of compartments separated by crap games." </p>

<p>It had photos of Lt. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Cmdr. Wallace Beery and Robert Montgomery, who was our embassy's naval attachÃ© in London. It featured a layout on Oscar winner Jimmy Stewart, who had joined up. There was Lt. Tyrone Power, Lauren Bacall's future husband Humphrey Bogart in the Navy, and Sgt. Glenn Ford, always to be remembered playing opposite Rita Hayworth in "Gilda." Plus one actor nobody will forget - Capt. Ronald Reagan. And "Gone With the Wind" 's Clark Gable, a captain. And big star Barbara Stanwyck, who was married to big star Robert Taylor, whose role then was lieutenant. If you don't remember him, you may remember his Mandeville Canyon 112-acre ranch complete with in-house casino, which is now owned by entrepreneur Ken Roberts and is where Hillary-for-senator's first fund-raiser was held. </p>

<p>That particular issue listed five reasons to buy "War Bonds": 1) World's safest place for your savings. 2) Written promise the U.S.A. will repay every penny. 3) 2.9 percent interest. 4) Cash back in 60 days if you need the money. 5) Can't go down in value. </p>

<p>One feature, "The Spirit of '76 in '42," read in part: "July Fourth, 1776 was the day on which the Declaration of Independence was signed. This supremely confident and challenging statement of the promise of American life - a promise, which has now become the hope of the world - was made amidst the dismal failure of Revolutionary armies." </p>

<p>The booklet "Historic New York" records some of these failures: In 1776 Nathan Hale, a 21-year-old Yale grad from Connecticut, led a battalion that joined George Washington against the massive British forces out to seize N.Y.C. When Washington retreated to northern Manhattan, this lone volunteer to spy behind British lines left Harlem Heights for his secret mission. Caught carrying sketches of British military positions and his Yale diploma, Nathan Hale was hanged after his famous last words: "I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country." </p>

<p>A plaque at 66th and Third marks the probable site of Hale's execution. A plaque in the shadow of 44th and Vanderbilt's Yale Club honors Nathan Hale. His statue stands at the Broadway and Murray streets' entrance to City Hall. </p>

<p>Enter Battle of Saratoga hero Benedict Arnold. Bitter at not being promoted, Arnold chose betrayal. In patriot Benjamin Franklin's evacuated home in occupied Philadelphia lived British Adjutant General John AndrÃ©, 30. Arnold arranged to turn over West Point's fort in return for a generalship in the British army. Andre was captured in Tarrytown and hanged in Tappan, maybe a tollbooth away from our now Tappan Zee Bridge. </p>

<p>When Americans declared independence in 1776, the enemy sent 500 ships carrying 30,000 troops to secure N.Y.C. Until D-Day, 1944, the largest naval attack in history. Washington and his overmatched army escaped New York to avoid capture. Thousands of New York rebels died. Thousands more on British prisons ships anchored in the Hudson. </p>

<p>In New York, the heart of our nation's Revolution, stands Fraunces Tavern, 54 Pearl St. It is where George Washington thanked his generals after the British surrender. </p>

<p>The Declaration of Independence was signed by 56 patriots. Merchants, farmers, lawyers, physicians, 10 were pastors' sons. Roger Sherman of Connecticut was a shoemaker's apprentice. Another, George Taylor, sailed to the New World as a bond servant. Benjamin Franklin, the eldest, was 70. South Carolina's Edward Rutledge, the youngest, 26. Virginia's Thomas Jefferson, 33. President of the First Continental Congress John Hancock of Massachusetts, 39. And it was deputy Patrick Henry, in the town of Richmond, on March 23 who said: "Give me liberty or give me death." </p>

<p>If caught, death was the penalty for their treason. The Plymouth Rock Foundation's "They Signed for Us" reminds us they risked their lives to sign for us. They were plundered, brutalized, destroyed, bankrupted, imprisoned, shot and hunted like animals so that today's citizens could trample our flag and set fire to it. </p>

<p>It must never be - no matter what our individual beliefs - that the spirit of the United States of America, the best country in this whole world, can ever be gone. <br />
