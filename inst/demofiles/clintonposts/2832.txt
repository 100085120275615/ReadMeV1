<p>I got this 50's recipe box (which Hutch cleaned up) at a yard sale about 4 years ago whilst on holiday in <del>Heaven</del> Hawaii.&nbsp; My Uncle is American and him and my Aunty live there.&nbsp; &nbsp;They do yard sales most week-ends, so we went with them. <br /> I hope we get to Hawaii again soon........................</p>

<p>Got <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/">Hillary's 1st pattern book</a> today in the mail, and also<br /><a href="http://www.thimble.ca/?p=570">July's buttons</a><br /><br />I just wanted to write that this blog is about all the &quot;happy things&quot; in my life.&nbsp; My life is crazy, full of up's and downs, but I write here to share my happiness :)&nbsp; Thanks for reading.&nbsp; <br />I fully dig this blogging world, so many creative souls that I would not know about otherwise.<br />
