<br />The Washington Times <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/national/20060721-111920-1539r.htm">reports</a> that Hillary and Julie Goodridge, the namesake couple in the landmark lawsuit that introduced same-sex "marriage" in Massachusetts two years ago, have separated.<br />
<br />The dissolution of this particular couple's relationship is particulary surprising to me because the article also reports that the couple had been together for 17 years prior to tying the knot. Then they got married and two years later, the marriage is over. It is beyond the scope of this post to postulate about the legality and morality of same-sex unions. I'd like to turn my attention, instead, to the issue of seperation and divorce. At the end of the article, the author reports that only 45 of the over 7,300 homosexual marriages have ended. That's about a 0.6% breakup rate. However, it's only been about 2 years. It remains to be seen if the homosexual divorce/seperation rate will become equal to the heterosexual one over an extended period of time, say 30 years.<br />
<br />This leads me to my question: It seems that in the secular world, as well as the world of some professing Christians, marriage seems to doom couples' relationships - especially those who have lived together beforehand according to various research. <span>With that said, why would anyone in their right mind want to get married? Why not just live together? What are the beneifts of marriage (besides lower taxes)?</span>
<br />
<br />Now, before you think I've lost my marbles (which I have by the way) I believe that Christian people should marry because it is certainly God's intention and God's plan. But, for someone who does not believe in the fact that the Bible is God's Word (and I'm taking a leap here that those homosexuals who marry do not hold the Bible in as high esteem as I do based on their actions), <span>why marry</span>?<br />
<br />If I was not a Christ-follower, I certainly would not be married at age 27. I would be living the life of a <span>Sex and the City</span> episode and date around, because, hey - you only live once. However, I do believe in God and that Christ came to seek and save what was lost and that he was crucified, buried, and rose again according to the Scriptures, and what the Bible postulates and decrees. Therefore I know that a marital and monogamous relationship with one woman is the <span>ideal</span> relationship on earth because it 1) reflects Christ's relationship with His church, 2) provides a safe, structured enviornment for raising children (another command of God), 3) ensures no STD's, and the psychological issues that go with having multiple sex partners, and 4) it sanctifies the couple.<br />
<br />And upon experiencing marriage for over 2.5 years, I know how wonderful it can be if it is centered around Christ. Any other marriage where Christ is not the center should be doomed to failure because of our selfishness and sinfulness. And Christian-based marriages do have problems and some end in divorce. (Although, I still firmly believe that divorce can be dodged 100% of the time if both people are willing to change themselves). Maybe I'm wrong here and I'm just more selfish then other people.<br />
<br />With that said, why do you think non-Christians marry?</div>
