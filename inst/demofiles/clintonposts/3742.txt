<div>What the fuck is this country coming to? I used to support GW. I even supported Clinton when he was in office. I haven't always agreed with either of them. Hell I never agreed with Clinton at all (except when he said a blow job wasn't sex) but I still supported him be cause he was the president of the greatest nation in the world. The good ol' USA. I now withdraw all support from Georgie. He has lost his fucking mind. I was all for the war, still am. I'm no longer for Dubya. In case you're missing my point, it's time to fire Bush and give somebody else a chance.<br />
<br />This latest atrocity of cataloging all domestic phone calls is pure insanity. The man is drunk with power. He says "all anti-terrorism efforts are within the law". I call bull shit on this one. It was bad enough that he allowed the agencies only known by initials to eavesdrop on calls made to the middle east. But this one is real fucking dangerous. I'm going to give you a little scenario. You do know what a scenario is, don't you? OK. Just making sure.<br />
<br />
<span>SCENARIO</span>
<br />Six people involved. These six people will be known as A, B, C, D, E and old friend. Pay attention. A calls B for a recipe. Guys known by initials catalog call. B calls C to find when little league game is. Guys known by initials catalog call. C calls D to talk dirty (D is a freak that way). Guys known by initials catalog call. D calls cousin E and just bullshits for a couple of hours. Guys known by initials catalog call. Now E calls old friend in Israel. Guys known by initials <span>tape</span> call. Old friend has ties to some middle eastern para-military organization. The Israelis bust old friend for knowing the para-military dudes. Israelis tell initial guys about it. Initial guys check for phone calls coming from the states. Oh look at this, E made a call to old friend. Who else is connected to E? Run a search through the data base. Well I'll be damned E is connected to A, B, C, and D. Now A, B, C, D and E are "possibly" terrorist sympathizers. They will be watched every minute of every day, just because they made a fucking phone call.<br />
<br />Do you see what I'm getting at? Were you also so aware that since digital cable and Tivo were invented that when you're watching TV, it's also watching you? It all seems a little Orwellian to me. Bet y'all didn't know I was a smart mother fucker, did you?  Back to GW.<br />
<br />All the smart republicans are starting to distance themselves from him and there seems to be a lot of them (more than there are smart democrats anyway). I've never been a one party kind of guy. Hell I say the more party's the better. But if I had to describe myself by one of the big two, I would have to say I'm republican (I'm really more of a free radical. In other words I'm unstable and react quickly). HA, more intellectual humor. Sometimes I crack me up. Anyway I always figured the democrats were more socialist than anything else. They want to take all the money from the rich, let me rephrase that. They want to take all the money from the other rich guys and give it to the lazy. Not the poor, but the lazy. The ones on welfare and other socialist programs. Now before you bombard me with your liberal comments let me just say sometimes people need a hand and I'm cool with that. I'm talking about second, third and fourth generation etc .etc. etc. welfare cases here. So keep your liberalisms to yourself. You know what, fuck it. Hit me with your best shot. I'm right and you're wrong, I already won the argument, so what you say doesn't matter. It's been so long since I blogged I forgot how to stick to one subject. Once again back to Bush.<br />
<br />Between taping phone calls and cataloging phone calls GW has managed to get everybody's thoughts off the most troubling thing in America today. The gas prices. The oil companies are getting fatter and fatter (getting fatter is something I know a lot about) and at the same time GW's wallet is getting fatter. He can't be re-elected so he might as well leave office filthy fucking rich. And he's going to. He could have put a stop to the oil companies collusion and price gouging a long time ago. No, he chose to let them rape the American people on a daily basis and every time the gas companies fuck us in the ass, GW gets a little richer. We're all gas whores and Georgie is pimping us out.<br />
<br />Wait. It gets worse. Now GW has us in a war. He's taping and cataloging phone calls. He's pimping us out to the gas companies. And he's not doing a damn thing about the illegal aliens (funny how that all just went away isn't it?). Plus he has cut spending on important things like the war on drugs (even though we all know it's the guys known only by initials that bring in the really big loads). And because off all this he has practically given the keys of the white house to Hillary Clinton. That's right, the ball crushing, clit licking, bad haircut, can't keep her husband happy in the bedroom bitch, Hillary Rodham Clinton is likely going to be our next president. Except in Texas (I plan on running things here). I can't seem to get my name out nationwide, so I'll just run for president of Texas.<span>
<br />
</span>
<br />Bottom line? America is going to hell. Sorry Phelps it has nothing to do with gays. It has to do with George W. Bush selling us out.<br />
<br />If you need me I'll be packing for my government sanctioned vacation. I hear Guantanamo Bay is nice this time of year.<br />
<br />One last piece of intellectual humor.<br />Rene' Descartes stumbles into a bar and demands a drink. The bartender says "Don't you think you've had enough?" Descartes stumbles back two steps and says loudly "I think not." and disappears. <span>Sometimes I really crack me up.</span>
