The Constant Reader will know that I have a bone to pick with <a href="http://islandpassage.blogspot.com/2005/12/how-democrats-are-loosing-evangelical.html">Democrats</a> who <a href="http://islandpassage.blogspot.com/2005/12/they-gave-at-office.html">put on</a> Christianity like a magic hat to try and <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20040705/balmer">convince us</a> dumb old fundamentalists that they, too, get this "God thing."<br /><br />Well, the Democrats have one national figure who "gets it." Barack Obama gave a very <a href="http://obama.senate.gov/speech/060628-call_to_renewal_keynote_address/index.html">thoughtful speech</a> the other day:<br /><blockquote>For some time now, there has been plenty of talk among pundits and pollsters that the political divide in this country has fallen sharply along religious lines. Indeed, the single biggest "gap" in party affiliation among white Americans today is not between men and women, or those who reside in so-called Red States and those who reside in Blue, but between those who attend church regularly and those who don't.<br /><br />Conservative leaders have been all too happy to exploit this gap, consistently reminding evangelical Christians that Democrats disrespect their values and dislike their Church, while suggesting to the rest of the country that religious Americans care only about issues like abortion and gay marriage; school prayer and intelligent design.<br /><br />Democrats, for the most part, have taken the bait. At best, we may try to avoid the conversation about religious values altogether, fearful of offending anyone and claiming that - regardless of our personal beliefs - constitutional principles tie our hands. At worst, there are some liberals who dismiss religion in the public square as inherently irrational or intolerant, insisting on a caricature of religious Americans that paints them as fanatical, or thinking that the very word "Christian" describes one's political opponents, not people of faith.<br /><br />...over the long haul, I think we make a mistake when we fail to acknowledge the power of faith in people's lives -- in the lives of the American people -- and I think it's time that we join a serious debate about how to reconcile faith with our modern, pluralistic democracy.<br /><br />And if we're going to do that then we first need to understand that Americans are a religious people. 90 percent of us believe in God, 70 percent affiliate themselves with an organized religion, 38 percent call themselves committed Christians, and substantially more people in America believe in angels than they do in evolution.<br /><br />...That's a path that has been shared by millions upon millions of Americans - evangelicals, Catholics, Protestants, Jews and Muslims alike; some since birth, others at certain turning points in their lives. It is not something they set apart from the rest of their beliefs and values. In fact, it is often what drives their beliefs and their values.<br /><br />...And that is why that, if we truly hope to speak to people where they're at - to communicate our hopes and values in a way that's relevant to their own - then as progressives, we cannot abandon the field of religious discourse.<br /><br />Because when we ignore the debate about what it means to be a good Christian or Muslim or Jew; when we discuss religion only in the negative sense of where or how it should not be practiced, rather than in the positive sense of what it tells us about our obligations towards one another; when we shy away from religious venues and religious broadcasts because we assume that we will be unwelcome - others will fill the vacuum, those with the most insular views of faith, or those who cynically use religion to justify partisan ends.</blockquote>And how was Senator Obama's speech received by his most outspoken fellow Democrats?<br /><br /><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/28/its-bill-clintons-fault/">It's Bill Clinton's Fault!</a><br /><blockquote>But this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/28/AR2006062800281.html">bullshit</a>  from <a href="http://www.mydd.com/story/2006/6/28/104440/256">Barack Obama</a> is Bill Clintonâs fault.  The greatest victory of the radical right wing has been to train Democratic politicians to disrespect, mischaracterize and run against their base in the progressive movement.  And that is Bill Clintonâs fault.</blockquote>Man, that netroots thing is what's gonna keep Republicans in power for the next 20 years.
