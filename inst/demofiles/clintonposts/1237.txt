The more that is revealed regarding this dysfunctional campaign, the more it makes you wonder what in the heck is this woman thinking? When trying to defeat a relatively popular incumbent Senator, it is probably best to have the support and blessing (and MONEY) of your party. To be sure, not having the party support has hurt Harris' campaign considerably, as there are undoubtedly many times when she could have used a few well placed friends during this tumultuous campaign. However, all too often Harris has been left to twist in the wind after going against the advise of Chairman Jordan.<br /><br />However, it also makes me wonder if Harris decision to stay in the race, against the advise of the party, is the reason that better qualified candidates such as <a href="http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2006/05/bense_wont_run_.html">Allan Bense, decided to stay out of the race</a>.<br />************************************************************************************<br />In other politico news:<br /><br />***Is it disconcerting to anybody that the two (arguably) <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/29/washington/29rivals.html?ei=5065&en=c05eac31f4771d4a&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;ex=1154836800&partner=MYWAY&amp;pagewanted=print">leaders for their respective party's 2008 presidential nominations were holding a vodka-drinking contest while in the Baltics together</a>?
