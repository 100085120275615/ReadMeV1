Okay, I awoke this morning to the news that Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi was killed. Totally awesome! This is great news for the war on terror and suppressing the insurgency in Iraq. Of course the media didn't know how to react, so they just wondered over and over again if this was actually a good thing. Whatever. Stupid fools. <br /><br />Meanwhile, Ann Coulter has a new book out, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400054206/ref=pd_rvi_gw_2/102-4701256-7428905?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=283155">Godless</a>, and boy does it have liberal panties in a knot. Hillary Clinton even decided to involve herself. I'll admit that I wouldn't use her choice of words when talking about the 9/11 widows (aka the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jersey_Girls">Jersey Girls</a>), but she does have a point. Liberals like to play this game where they send out spokespeople who have some sort of divine, inalienable right to say whatever they want because of some personal connection to the issue. For example, Cindy Sheehan can say whatever she wants about the war on terror or President Bush because her son died in Iraq. (Her son, on the other hand, can't tell her to shove it.) It's such a weird mindset. Just because her son died in Iraq doesn't make her a foreign policy expert or seasoned political analyst.<br /><br />It's only been out for two days, but already 700 people have reviewed her book on Amazon.com. I'm guessing that about 7 (that's 1%!) have actually read it. Anytime she writes a new book, you know there's going to be controversy. Like with "Slander," liberals were enraged that she would suggest the media have a liberal bias. Coverage of the book, its author, and subsequent reviews only seemed to prove her point. With her latest book, it seems like we're repeating ourselves once again.
