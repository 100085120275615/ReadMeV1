<p><big>A top New York court has ruled in favor of traditional marriage, much to the dismay of Senator Hillary Clinton and the homosexual activists who filed the suit two years ago.  </p>

<p>One of the four  suits  was between <a href="http://www.courts.state.ny.us/ctapps/decisions/jul06/86-89opn06.pdf">Daniel Hernandez and Victor Robles</a> and was filed on behalf of 44 same sex couples who all tried to get a marriage license and were denied the marriage license.</p>

<p>The discussion of the verdict begins this way, <strong>&#8220;All the parties to these cases now acknowledge, implicitly or explicitly, that the Domestic Relations Law limits marriage to opposite-sex couples.&#8221;  </strong> The discussion continues with these statements, <strong>&#8220;Articles 2 and 3 of the Domestic Relations Law, which govern marriage, nowhere say in so many words that only people of different sexes may marry each other, but that was the universal understanding when Articles 2 and 3 were adopted in 1909, an understanding reflected in several statutes. Domestic Relations Law รยง 12 provides that &#8220;the parties must solemnly declare . . .that they take each other as husband and wife.&#8221;
</strong>
The decision goes on to say the following concerning why they ruled in favor of man and woman marriage and not same sex marriage.  These are very rational reasons as you will see.</p>

<p>First reason - the welfare of the children. <strong>&#8220;First, the Legislature could rationally decide that,
for the welfare of children, it is more important to promote stability, and to avoid instability, in opposite-sex than in same-sex relationships. Heterosexual intercourse has a natural
tendency to lead to the birth of children; homosexual intercourse does not. Despite the advances of science, it remains true that the vast majority of children are born as a result of a sexual
relationship between a man and a woman, and the Legislature could find that this will continue to be true.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>The second reason - a child needs a mother and a father. <strong>&#8220;There is a second reason: The Legislature could rationally believe that it is better, other things being equal, for children to grow up with both a mother and a father. Intuition and experience suggest that a child benefits from
having before his or her eyes, every day, living models of what both a man and a woman are like.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>The decision goes on to say how the plantiff&#8217;s have  not proven their case based on prejudice.  <strong>&#8220;Plaintiffs have not persuaded us that this longaccepted restriction is a wholly irrational one, based solely on ignorance and prejudice against homosexuals.&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>I think this is great news for men and women everywhere who believe that same sex marriage will never be the best or a good option.</p>
