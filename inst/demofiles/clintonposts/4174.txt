Of course, like everything else printed about Senator Clinton is also may not be accurate.  And this is from the Pakistani Daily Times which is not really unbiased.  Still, it's being said so we are showing it here.</p>

<blockquote>Senator Hillary Clinton, who received much support from the Muslim, including the Pakistani, community in her first successful run for the US Senate is unlikely to retain it, considering the unabashedly pro-Israeli positions she has repeatedly taken on issue after issue. She is up for re-election this year. The latest instance of her pro-Israeli views is her call to the international community to shun Hamas. ÂNo nation in the world should recognise a governmentÂ committed to its neighbourÂs destruction, the Democratic senator from New York said on Sunday at the annual congressional breakfast sponsored by the New York Jewish Community Relations Council. She said American policy on Iran should be Âclear and unequivocalÂ, adding, ÂWe cannot allow Iran to build nuclear weapons.Â Mrs Clinton is also seen as eyeing a run for the Democratic ticket for the US presidency in 2008. She said, ÂItÂs a false choiceÂ to separate security issues and Âour mutual commitmentÂ to help the poor and needy. Senator Charles Schumer, her fellow Democrat from New York and several members of New YorkÂs congressional delegation, also spoke about the need to contain Hamas and Iran.</blockquote>
