	<p>Peter Beinert makes some good points about how the right wing is already shaping the &#8220;conventional wisdom&#8221; about Hillary Clinton, in order to attack her on the &#8220;character issue.&#8221;</p>
	<p>This has been the pattern for the past dozen years, or more. Republicans, not very strong on logical consistency, complain that Democratic candidates are simultaneously the most liberal activists around, and the most opportunistic, with no core beliefs. Huh? But it works. And it will work as they pre-emptively assassinate Hillary Clinton&#8217;s character.</p>
	<p>Not that I think Hillary would be a good presidential candidate, but we&#8217;ve got to do something about the right wing&#8217;s addiction to the politics of personal destruction.
