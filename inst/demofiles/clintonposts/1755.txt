<br />I've mentioned in previous posts that I believe that US Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY) will be the next President of the US.<br />
<br />Interesting side note, remember back in school when kids USED to learn useful and interesting trivia and memorized the state capitals or the succession of Presidents? I always liked the late 19th century when the line-up went: Garfield, Arthur, Cleveland, Harrison, Cleveland. First there was the childhood humor found in that a cartoon cat had once been President, but that repeating Cleveland thing made an interesting cadence. Anyway, children years from now will have the EVEN more interesting cadence of... Reagan, (GHW)Bush, (Bill)Clinton, (GW)Bush, (HR)Clinton, (Jeb)Bush, (Roger)Clinton, (GP)Bush, (Chelsea)Clinton. Fun, HUH?<br />
<br />Now, I'm not exactly sure what this "Sex Museum" is, I have my suspicions and they include the X-President being on the Board of Directors. So there might be some 'behind the scenes' politicking going on. So aside from its location, I think it is a handsome bust of the Senator... just try not to look too much at her hooters.</div>
