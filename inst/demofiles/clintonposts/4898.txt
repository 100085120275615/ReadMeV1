<p>With Labor Day rapidly approaching, news is breaking out in races all over the country. We can't get to all of it on a busy day like today, but here are a couple of interesting tidbits.</p>

<p><strong>Republicans Love Lieberman</strong></p>

<p>A new <a href="http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x11359.xml">Quinnipiac University poll of likely voters in Connecticut</a> shows incumbent Sen. <strong><a href="http://www.joe2006.com/">Joe Lieberman</a></strong> (D/I) leading businessman <strong><a href="http://nedlamont.com/">Ned Lamont</a></strong> (D) and former state Rep. <strong><a href="http://www.schlesinger2006.com/">Alan Schlesinger</a></strong>. Lieberman won the support of 53 percent of those surveyed. Lamont had 41 percent, while Schlesinger took an amazingly low four percent.</p>

<p>The poll seems to show that Lieberman, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/08/AR2006080800596.html">who lost the Aug. 8 Democratic primary to Lamont</a>, has become the de facto Republican candidate <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/elections/keyraces/88/">in the race</a>, scoring incredibly high with GOPers in the state.  Lieberman recieved 75 percent among Republicans in the sample as compared to 13 percent for Lamont and 10 percent for Schlesinger. Democrats supported Lamont by a 63 percent to 35 percent margin (Schlesinger did not even receive one percent support). Lieberman also won Independents by a 58 percent to 36 percent margin over Lamont. Schlesinger clocked in at three percent.</p>

<p>Those head-to-head numbers tracked with other measurements of support for the three men in the poll.  Overall, 53 percent of likely voters thought Lieberman deserved re-election while 40 percent did not. A whopping 80 percent of Republicans said the incumbent deserved another term compared with just 32 percent of Democrats. Independents favored another term for Lieberman by a 57 percent to 35 percent margin.</p>

<p>The question going forward is whether Lieberman can keep the strong support he currently enjoys in Connecticut Republican circles.  With the primary so recent, it's possible that many Republicans are expressing support for Lieberman simply to show disdain for Lamont and his opposition to the war in Iraq. Do those Republicans stay with Lieberman or do they eventually revert back to their Republican roots and support Schlesinger?  If Schlesinger's recent appearance on Hardball with Chris Matthews (in which he struggled to explain questions regarding his interest in gambling) is any indication, the Republican is simply not ready for prime time.  Knowing this, Republicans may stick with Lieberman for fear of a Sen. Lamont. </p>

<p>This continues to be the single most fascinating race in the country at the moment and shows no signs of getting less interesting in the coming 80 (or so) days before the election.</p>

<p><strong>Clinton Ad on the Air</strong></p>

<p>New York Sen. <strong><a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/">Hillary Rodham Clinton</a></strong> (D) has hit the television airwaves with the <a href="http://www.hillaryclinton.com/i/video/20060816/">first ad</a> of her re-election coronation, er, campaign.  The 60-second ad features  testimonials from New Yorkers about Clinton's work on a variety of issues: securing funds for New York in the aftermath of Sept. 11, saving military bases, and working on healthcare -- especially for children.</p>

<p>Since Clinton has no real race this fall, it's impossible to see this ad through anything other than a 2008 lens.  At the start of the spot, several people admit they began with doubts about Clinton but were won over during her six years in the Senate.</p>

<p>The issues highlighted in the ad -- national security, support for military, job creation -- all appeal to moderate voters who will likely decide the 2008 election.  While only New Yorkers will see these ads with any kind of frequency, they will be picked up and analyzed by national and local media outlets ad nauseam in the coming months. (And, yes, the author of The Fix is aware of his own complicity in that previous sentence.)  Therefore, Clinton's ad campaign becomes another step in a 2008 presidential bid.</p>

<p>Watch closely for the messaging in Clinton's ads going forward. Does she stay focused on issues that appeal to the center like job creation and national security? Or does she step up her criticism of the Iraq war and the Bush Administration's handling of it in hopes of putting down a potential rebellion from the anti-war left in the presidential process?</p>
