<div>I've got the whole day to myself tomorrow. Have no idea what to do with myself. So you will probably see me here, browsing blogs, wandering around the Net aimlessly.<br />
<br />Maybe I'll do some more planning for next year. Maybe I'll sit around and watch Jerry Springer (NOT). I've got a few books going now: Teen Proofing by John Rosemond, Condi vs. Hillary by Dick Morris, and tons of homeschooling catalogs to peruse. I need to clean up my bookshelves to make room for new stuff. Ugh. I SO could use some help getting motivated.<br />
<br />What motivates you?<br />

<span>Rant of the day...</span>
<br />Oh! Why, why, WHY did I ever marry? Why didn't I listen to my mother? Twenty-three is far too young to make a clearheaded decision about the rest of your life. Or maybe it's not. Maybe it's just me that wasn't capable of tying my shoes and chewing gum at the same time in my early twenties. (Disclaimer: I'm only 34 now and don't profess to be not one iota smarter.)<br />
<br />It's like Indiana Jones when he's standing there trying to choose the right cup. The old man says, "Chooooooose wisely." This one. No. That one. No. Yes. Awwww fuck.<br />
<br />I couldn't have made a poorer choice. My ex makes Danny Bonnaduce look like a model husband. What the fuck was I thinking? I can't even make any excuses. I don't know why I was initially attracted to him. He was good looking. But so what? So were the four or five guys I dated before him.<br />
<br />What a dumbass. (Not me. Him. No wait. Me, too.) Jesus H. Christ. I can't take 15 more years of him. I'd rather have my eyes plucked out by vultures.<br />
<br />
<span>Thought for the day...</span>
<br />If the gods listened to the prayers of men, all humankind would quickly perish since they constantly pray for many evils to befall one another. âEpicurus<br />
