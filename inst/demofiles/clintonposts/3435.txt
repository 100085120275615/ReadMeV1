<div>November 3, 2006.<br />
<br />Successful young blogger A. J. Nolte woke up late, having been out all night at a victory party. Flushed with exhilaration after the massive Republican victories of the day before, Nolte sat down at his trusty laptop to write about the historic day. After thinking for a few minutes, he began:<br />âRealignment. Thereâs absolutely no other word for what happened last night. And I have to say, November 2 2006 has to go down as one of the best days of my life: right next to the free elections in Iraq and Lebanon, and the 2004 reelection of the president. Yesterday was a great day for so many reasons, but let me start close to home. Here in Pennsylvania, there was quite a lot of reason to celebrate. Rick Santorumâs victory against Bob Casey was the first resounding smack to the left to be delivered last night. As my regular readers no, I predicted Caseyâs implosion: from the not inconsiderable pro-choice challenge mounted to him in the primaries, to the nasty bind Santorumâs photo perfect âWould you, treasurer Casey, filibuster the next Supreme Court justice?â challenge in the televised debate of September 17, to which Casey gave a faltering and fumbling reply which displeased everyone, right up to Caseyâs last-ditched negative campaigning, which tilted undecideds definitively in Santorumâs direction. But this victory was not to be the end of Republican and conservative celebration in PA. Lynn Swann, GOP gubernatorial candidate, swept to victory last night over Democrat incumbent Ed Rendell. Swannâs charismatic speeches and clear, optimistic (dare I say, Reaganesque) platform helped him streak past Rendellâs piddling defenses and score the biggest touchdown of his life (sorry, Iâve been on the campaign trail with him for the past six months: canât help the football metaphor).<br />And PA was not the end of GOP success last night. Letâs take a quick tour of the nation shall we?<br />New York: Hillary Clinton and Eliot Spitzer: who could be stronger than that dynamic duo? Well, it turned out that Randy Daniels, NYâs African-American secretary of state, put a big hurtinâ on Mr. Spitzer (helped in part by the investigative reporting of the WSJ, among others, who discovered massive corruption in AG Spitzerâs office). As for Ms. Clinton, she was no match for Rudi Juliani in one of the nastiest and most high profile senate campaigns in New York history. Congratulations Rudi, and thanks for that âUnlike Ms. Clinton, Iâll put the interests of the people of New York above my personal ambition.â<br />Maryland: The stunning GOP double victory here marks a turning-point in Marylandâs political history. Letâs begin with Bob Erlic, who risked much and gained more by giving up the governorâs mansion to challenge Democrat incumbent Paul Sarbanes in the senate. Erlicâs victory helps consolidate the Republican trend in this bluest of blue states. As does the victory of Erlicâs former lieutenant governor, the new governor of Maryland, Michael Steel. Steel trounced Democrat challenger, Baltimore mayor Martin OMally.<br />Ohio: The big news here is the victory of Ken Blackwell, former secretary of state, in his gubernatorial quest. Blackwell joins three other new African-American Republican incumbents in PA, MD and NY, leading some pundits to dub these four GOP rising stars the âfour horsemen of the mid-Atlantic.â<br />Michigan: Upset has a new meaning, as Jennifer Granholm goes down in flames. Her challenger, Hispanic GOP state senator (and veteran, hoo-ah) Valde Garcia of Michigan, helped lead the GOP to their best showing among minorities in Michigan in history. This plus the GOP victory in the Michigan senate race puts this light blue state in a GOP-leaning column.<br />Florida: Shut out. Thatâs how the Democrats in FLA must feel after the victory of gubernatorial candidate Tony Jennings and senatorial candidate Eliana Ros-Lehtinen. Ros-Lehtinenâs victory leaves FLA with two Hispanic Republican senators of high quality, and leaves Florida Democrats scrambling for a solution to their sudden crisis.<br />Virginia: Lucky saves. After George Allenâs announcement that he would not seek reelection in order to focus on his presidential ambitions, VA Republicans feared the worst. But GOP AG Jerry Kilgore held out to win the governorâs race last year, and surprise Republican candidate Linda Chavez coasted to victory over her challenger, former Democrat governor Mark Warner.<br />Illinois: The nasty primary fight waged by some Illinois Democrats against Rod Blogojivitch cleared the way for former Bears coach Mike Ditka, who won a resounding popular victory in this blue state. A good day for football-playing Republicans.<br />Oklahoma: How cool does it sound to say Governor J. C. Watts? Well get used to it, J.C. is back in town! Thatâs five African-American Republican governors, countâem five baby!<br />Minnesota: My man Tim Polenti held out against disgraced Democrat senator Mark Daton. Best of all though, Minnesota just put another Kennedy in the senate. Thatâs Mark Kennedy, Republican hotshot. The Republican senator Kennedy will be giving them heck.<br />Rhode Island: In one of the few losses this cycle, RINO Lincoln Chafee fell to Democrat challenger Jim Lanjovine. However, the new senator is pro-life, and Chafeeâs refusal to support the president during the last election limited the dollars the RNSC would spend on him. Chafee has picked up his ball, and blissfully gone home.<br />Massachusetts: despite spending an exorbitant amount of money, Democrats couldnât dislodge Mitt Romney, who remains governor there.<br />Vermont: Jim Douglass, the stateâs popular governor, was handily reelected. Meanwhile, Jim Jeffords barely beat back a primary challenge from socialist Berney Sanders, in a primary battle which amused us all.<br />Texas: Cay Bailey Hutchinsonâs challenge to governor Rick Perry looked like trouble. Instead, it ushered in the senate career of Henry Bonilla. With Bonilla, Chavez and Ros-Lehtinen joining Mel Martinez in the senate, it looks like a lonely couple of years for loan Democratic Hispanic Ken Salazar. Texas also added several more Hispanic congressmen, from the GOP of course.<br />Washington: It seems as if Deano Rasiâs gamble has paid off, as Washington now has him as a Republican senator, and as former senate candidate George Nethercutt will run (and run strongly) against âgovernorâ Gregwar in 2008.<br />Arizona: Yet another GOP upset here, as congressman Jeff Flake took down governor Janet Napolitano.<br />Colorado: Mark Holsmann successfully held this governorship. And best of all, Tom Tancredo was knocked off by a pro-life Hispanic, moderate Democrat, who is already talking with the GOP about switching parties. Anti-immigrationism just doesnât win elections, and Tancredoâs violation of a term limits pledge didnât help him against his opponent, the only Democrat to be supported this year by the club for growth.<br />New Mexico: So we didnât take down Bill Richardson, but the challenge to him launched by Heather Wilson was much more formidable than previously expected. Expect Wilson to take on Jeff Bingaman, and win.<br />West Virginia: knocking off Robert Bird was sweet wasnât it? Congratulations to Shelly Capito for putting Bird in his political bed sheets. Also, after a depressing night like last night, Democrats are looking with desperation to West Virginiaâs governor, the pro-life tax-cutting tort-reforming DINO Joe Manchin. Manchin is now being talked about seriously as a Democrat presidential candidate.<br />
<br />California, Not only did Ahnold coast to victory against foolish Democrat challenger Barbara Boxer, but Republicans picked up something like five congressional seats as a result of the governatorâs redistricting. Three of them (and one of the seats held by a Republican after an incumbantâs retirement), were held by minorities. Congratulations are also in order for Tom McClintock, who will be the new senator from California, and who, not incidentally, is also a Republican.<br />Congratulations Ken Melmann: the GOP is the majority party, and with the appointment of chief justice Thomas and associate justices Janice Rogers Brown and Michael Luddig, real progress on the reforming of the judiciary has been made. Last night, the GOP took a long step toward securing the future of this country for generations to come.â<br />
