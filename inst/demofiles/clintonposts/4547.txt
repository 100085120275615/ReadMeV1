<p>I just want to let every one know that Hillary Clinton is an unelectable presidential candidate. Some may think she is a formidable candidate, but I think she is a gift to republicans.</p>
<p>First, she has too much baggage. Between whitewater and Monica she is a national joke. No one can take a woman seriously who hasn&#8217;t enough respect for herself than to share her marital bed with an intern. Furthermore her whitewater roots soils her hands too much to be a viable candidate. Additionally, we know her husband can be smeared for much more than he already has been; thereby, further distancing her chances at the Presidency.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, she is not publicly acceptable. During any speech I&#8217;ve ever heard her give, she has left me with one of two impressions. She&#8217;s either a bitch or boring. I&#8217;ve never heard her speak without falling asleep or thinking, damn this woman is a bitch.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I think. I hate to say it but, Condi kind of comes off the same way but to lesser extremes. As a society I think we see strong women as bitches. We may not be ready to elect the U.S. Margaret Thatcher because she hasn&#8217;t shown herself yet. Neither Condi nor, especially, Hillary measure up to the stature of a Margaret Thatcher.</p>
<p>Condi is the intellectual equivalent, if not superior, to Margaret Thatcher. However, I don&#8217;t think she has the street smarts/political savvy to pull off a presidential candidacy.
