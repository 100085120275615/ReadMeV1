<em>Victory has a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan -- President John F. Kennedy, 1961<br /></em><br />And you thought that good things never happened anymore -- or, if they are, nobody in the media reports them. Well, here's good news: for years cynics have griped (or more likely sarcastically joked), and rightfully so, about the blatant parking ticket scofflaws among diplomats at the United Nations. People despaired of ever seeing the situation return to "normal." It was an open sore, a festering wound, a maddening metaphor for an America trapped in an organization it no longer could control -- right down to parking tickets purposely run up by ignorant diplomats abusing their privileges.<br /><br />Here at <em>Bemusings,</em> we are sure that there is credit to spread all around, from former Mayor Rudy Gulianni and current Mayor Michael Bloomberg to New York Senators Schumer and Clinton. Good old Yankee poltical hard work worked like a charm for once. We are also sure that two new problems will spring up to take its place.<br /><br /><span>The problem seemed insoluable, then a miracle happened! </span><br /><br /><strong>New York Times<br /></strong>To the Editor:<br /><br />Contrary to David Brooksâs <a href="http://select.nytimes.com/2006/08/13/opinion/13brooks.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fOp%2dEd%2fColumnists%2fDavid%20Brooks">Aug. 13 column</a>, diplomats in New York City no longer rack up a lot of unpaid parking tickets. Working with the State Department, the Bloomberg administration crafted and put into effect in November 2002 a new diplomatic parking program that ended parking with impunity and reduced the number of unpaid summonses.<br /><br />Since that time, the total number of diplomatic parking tickets issued has dropped by nearly 90 percent, little new debt is accruing and â with the help of federal legislation â old debt accrued before the parking program started has been reduced by $4 million. A diplomat who has more than three unpaid parking tickets in 100 days now faces the same enforcement action as every New Yorker.<br /><br />Marjorie B.

Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced Congress will pass their proposal that would cut foreign aid to nations that owe New York City unpaid parking tickets and back property tax. The bill now awaits final approval by Congress before heading to the President for his signature.<br /></em><br />Despite significant progress over the last year to collect parking tickets from deadbeat diplomats and to crack down on diplomatic building owners who owe property taxes, New York City is still owed approximately $195 million from foreign consulates and embassies.<br /><br />"Other than getting a pink slip from your boss, few things are as crushing as getting one of those little orange envelopes from a traffic cop. If you or I ignore a parking ticket, we have to pay double the fine. If a diplomat ignores a parking ticket, we send him foreign aid. That makes no sense. And forget about not paying your property tax bill â theyâll take your house.<br /><br />"Well, regardless of who you are or where you are from, you're not above the law in New York," Senator Schumer said.
