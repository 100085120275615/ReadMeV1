<p>Back in the Nineties it seemed like every young girl was named Jessica, but really, there was only the one.&nbsp; The one that mattered.</p>

<p>Shortly after the Millennium she was on TV.&nbsp; And when I saw her, I just knew.&nbsp; It was obvious, at least to me.&nbsp; Nobody else came close, nobody had that... force to her.&nbsp; I remember getting my best friend T. to watch an episode, and T. went, &quot;Well, yeah, she's hot.&quot;&nbsp; And I was... &quot;Hot?!&quot;&nbsp; Inadequate word.&nbsp; &nbsp;I love T. but I have to say: maybe a little bit superficial. </p>

<p>I'd been having nightmares for years, horrifically grim ones about the end of civilization -- it might've been seeing that scary news footage of the nighttime bombing of Baghdad in the first Gulf War -- but after the Twin Towers it got worse.&nbsp; I'd wake up in the middle of the night, terrified, and... it was Jessica who consoled me: thoughts of her, images of her that calmed me, giving reason back to the world.</p>

<p><a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/alba_moepsegross.jpg"><img title="Alba_moepsegross" height="258" alt="Alba_moepsegross" src="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/my_weblog/images/alba_moepsegross.jpg" width="200" border="0" /></a> And it wasn't what you think.&nbsp; I couldn't picture her that way, I couldn't imagine doing with her, you know, those things men really want to do with a woman.&nbsp; Hers isn't a body to be naked, anyway, it's meant to be <em>almost</em>.&nbsp; It has to be the <em>promise</em> of nudity, ever unfulfilled, so that she's still... pure, I suppose.&nbsp; You don't really want to see, for example, an actual bared nipple -- it's too naked, too vulnerable, too <em>human</em>, finally.</p>

<p>Anyway, by the time the movies came out I began to understand I wasn't alone in this.&nbsp; Her fans were already legion, not just men, but women (and where could they find a better role model?) and I had to make that adjustment, where you realize Jessica isn't just <em>yours</em>.&nbsp; I mean, yes, I was there first, in the vanguard, but when someone's that powerful and charismatic, the culture catches up -- as it should!&nbsp; It only makes sense.</p>

<p>Even after the big ones, the awesome triumvirate of <em>Sin City</em>, <em>Fantastic Four</em> and <em>Into the Blue</em>, T. continued to be slow on the uptake.&nbsp; &quot;Why don't you obsess about a real woman, a grown woman, a woman of substance, like... Meryl Streep?&quot; T. asked.&nbsp; Well, Meryl Streep is wonderful, I allowed, but she's...&nbsp; &quot;What?&quot; demanded T.&nbsp; &quot;Brilliant?&nbsp; Sophisticated?&nbsp; Emotionally nuanced, deep, talented beyond measure?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's not...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Young?&nbsp; A sex object?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;She's not <em>Jessica</em>,&quot; I explained.</p>

<p>And speaking of her movies I should explain how they had a profound effect on my life and livelihood.&nbsp; I work for a studio, reading scripts, and as fate would have it, I read a draft of <em>Into the Blue </em>when it was just a project looking for a home, hadn't yet been cast.&nbsp; And because it was godawful, contrived, badly written derivative genre swill, I &quot;passed&quot; on the script; some other studio ended up making it.</p>

<p><a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/jessica_alba.jpg"><img title="Jessica_alba" height="224" alt="Jessica_alba" src="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/my_weblog/images/jessica_alba.jpg" width="150" border="0" /></a> Then I saw the movie and the resulting epiphany was <em>life-changing</em>.&nbsp; I suddenly understood that the movie wasn't about two-dimensional genre stereotypes diving, treasure-hunting, cocaine smuggling, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Hello</em>?&nbsp; It was about Jessica in that turquoise blue bikini top and little grey-blue striped bikini bottom, specifically in those breathtaking underwater this-is-my-butt and these-are-my-ribs-when-my-belly-undulates shots.</p>

<p>(Not to deny the appeal of Jessica in her blue wetsuit, the beige tank top and cut-off jean shorts, the designer wife-beater undershirt, the yellow longsleeve top, the silver and black hooded wet suit w/blue flippers and red flowered bathing suit bottom, the disco gold halter and jeans, the blue tank top and itsy-bitsy light blue panties, the grey black and white striped top, and the white bikini with black stripes.)</p>

<p>Seeing <em>Into the Blue</em> the first half dozen times completely altered my perspective on the business I was in.&nbsp; What's &quot;bad&quot; anyway, when a movie makes money?&nbsp; So thereafter, no matter how terrible the script was, if I could see Jessica in it, especially in a bathing suit, I'd give it good marks in my coverage and just write in the Comments summary box: <em>Great part for Jessica</em>.</p>

<p>Then one day my Story Editor called me into her office and asked me a lot of weird questions and kept talking about what she termed &quot;my fixation.&quot;&nbsp; And I got it, suddenly, it was like I'd stepped onto the set of a horror movie, and I said, &quot;Wait a second&quot; -- I really was incredulous -- &quot;Are you actually telling me that you don't want to make a movie with Jessica?&quot;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Then the Story Editor asked me how long I'd been reading for the studio and I told her and she nodded and looked at her assistant and then -- the two of them were very nice about it, really -- that's how I got to be on this leave of absence.</p>

<p><a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/alba1.jpg"><img title="Alba1" height="262" alt="Alba1" src="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/my_weblog/images/alba1.jpg" width="350" border="0" /></a> </p>

<p>It's funny how with a little extra time on your hands, you can begin to see things in a new perspective.&nbsp; Because not being at work is what led me to my brilliant idea.</p>

<p>It was the night of the <em>MTV Movie Awards</em>, with Jessica hosting.&nbsp; T. didn't come over to watch with me because we'd had a kind of falling out.&nbsp; Recently T., having see the Al Gore movie, was talking about global warming all the time, which had led to a new kind of nightmare for me, in which all of Los Angeles was underwater but people were still talking on cellphones in their cars and making too-wide turns.&nbsp; And when I woke up I had to watch my <em>Sin City</em> DVD a <em>lot</em>.</p>

<p>The last time we'd been together, T. picked up my copy of <em>Entertainment Weekly</em> that had Jessica on the cover as their &quot;Must List&quot; cover girl, and said, &quot;But I don't understand -- she doesn't even have a new movie out!&quot;&nbsp; And I snatched it out of T.'s hand and said &quot;No, clearly you <em>don't</em> understand, do you.&quot;</p>

<p>So it was just me and my popcorn and the TV and...&nbsp; The glory: all Jessica, right from the first minute, with a wonderful <a href="http://www.doubleagent.com/video.php?v=978&amp;ct=70">movie parody</a> (annihilating the idiot critics who question her acting ability) and then more Jessica, hostessing us and born to it, making fun of herself with that joke about being the most searched celeb on <em>Google</em> (although actually, is 10,000 hits a day so unusual or excessive?) and then more Jessica.&nbsp; Until the peak of the evening, Jessica winning Sexiest Performance for <em>Sin City </em>(well, duh!).</p>

<p><a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/alba_jessicagun.jpg"><img title="Alba_jessicagun" height="300" alt="Alba_jessicagun" src="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/my_weblog/images/alba_jessicagun.jpg" width="200" border="0" /></a> She was so sweetly self-deprecating in <a href="http://www.mtve.com/article.php?ArticleId=6355">her acceptance speech</a> -- how many actresses would say &quot;I'm going to keep this brief because you're already seeing so much of me tonight&quot;?&nbsp; And then the most extraordinary thing: almost an after-thought, just as she was leaving the podium, she called out, &quot;Practice safe sex!&nbsp; And buy hybrid cars!&quot;</p>

<p>The audience went crazy cheering, and that's when it hit me.&nbsp; You know how they say more people voted for the <em>American Idol</em> winner this year than voted in the last Presidential election?&nbsp; Not surprising when you think about it, if I wanted another nightmare, I'd picture John Kerry singing karaoke.&nbsp; But Jessica...!</p>

<p>After all, Angelina and Brad are doing so well with that place in Africa with the starving kids, the genocide -- people listen to them!&nbsp; Well, imagine what Jessica could do, <em>if she was a presidential candidate</em>.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Forget Hillary.&nbsp; Please, who wants to...&nbsp; Jessica, if she was in office, she'd be unstoppable.&nbsp; Let alone the fact that she can really kick butt if she's crossed, who would deny her anything she wanted?&nbsp; Tanned and vivacious, put her up against the head of any nation who's giving us a hard time, and -- with a smile, a shrug, especially if she wore that turquoise bikini -- look, even crazy Kim Jong Il from North Korea: <a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/ill_lineabig122103_1.jpg"></a>nuclear missiles, shmissiles, all that crap would fly right out of his head if he was facing Jessica as the leader of the free world, he would <em>chill</em>, believe me. </p>

<p><a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/ill_lineabig122103.jpg"></a><a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/jessica_alba_afp.jpg"></a><a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/jessica_alba_afp_1.jpg"><img title="Jessica_alba_afp_1" height="240" alt="Jessica_alba_afp_1" src="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/my_weblog/images/jessica_alba_afp_1.jpg" width="200" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/ill_lineabig122103_2.jpg"><img title="Ill_lineabig122103_2" height="119" alt="Ill_lineabig122103_2" src="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/my_weblog/images/ill_lineabig122103_2.jpg" width="150" border="0" /></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>And in terms of ending the war and getting everyone to put the guns down, she could walk right into the desert, right onto that battlefield, and do you think any terrorist would shoot at her?&nbsp; Would any of those rockets or those bombs harm a lustrous hair on her beautifully coiffed head?&nbsp; Are you joking?! </p>

<p>But then I think, no, it's wrong.&nbsp; Why get her involved in all of that?&nbsp; </p>

<p><a href="http://livingromcom.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/jessica_alba_afp.jpg"></a>Because after all, she's already doing her job.&nbsp; She's what we want to see, she's all we need to know, such a comfort to watch, so arousing and soothing at the same time -- and I don't mind sharing her with the rest of you anymore, when I look at it this way, when I understand how good she is at what she's doing now, how vast a need she fulfills so well.&nbsp; She's already there for us, she's already so important, so vital to our national security, in every sense of that word, to our national... everything.</p>

<p>Jessica, our Jessica.&nbsp; <em>Jessica</em>.</p>

<p>She's the one.</p>
