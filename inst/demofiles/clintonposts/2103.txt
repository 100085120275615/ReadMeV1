<div align="justify">Sometimes, as pure distractive procrastination, i go on-line and glance at the Sydney Morning Herald, an Australian newspaper. It is not, in my estimate, particularly informative - a smattering of news, gossip and sports, but it was the daily paper of my childhood. i grew up in that city - gloriously perched on the harbour, edged by ocean. Sprawling for miles, with fingers of water weaving through suburbs. We lived on the boundary of a large bushland valley lining a creek which fed into a river. Although the vegetation there is so different - eucalypts not oak and pine - walking in the forest here sometimes reminds me of wandering from our fenceless back yard down to the creek.<br />Yesterday I read a short article on-line which deeply disturbs me. It says that while on the last leg of the ascent of Mt Everest several climbers - not just one - passed a fellow climber in a snow cave, suffering from oxygen deprivation. Apparently no-one stopped to assist; the man in the cave perished. Sir Edmund Hillary, who along with his Sherpa were the first to reach the roof of the world, was horrified to hear that people relentless on reaching the peak had passed by someone in dire need; he said he would have chosen to abandon their historic ascent.<br />As with any such case, there is controversy and debate. Some say they were unaware of the man, others say they did not know he was dying. Bizarrely and sadly, someone filmed his actual death, he unconscious, arms and legs frozen - a video his family has said they do not wish to view.<br />I felt great sorrow as I caught this brief glimpse into choices that were made in pursuit of a dream. I am sure every person who aims for this strenuous climb has poured time, effort, planning, money into its accomplishment. When it's almost in your grasp, how hard it could be to let go - even to investigate the possibility that you may have to turn back. I have no idea of how events unfolded that led to such a human tragedy, or even what the facts may be, but it raises the question about decisions we make, as individuals, as communities, as a planet. How we may choose to ignore, or pretend we don't see, the terrible suffering around us. How ambition and desire can overrule the most basic human kindness. How we create war and then recoil when violent, cruel anger is the result. I recently browsed a website which showed a dog being skinned alive for its fur, very valuable when marketed as that of a more exotic beast.<br />The header for this blog contains a statement of Jetsunma's regarding the profound potential of this Valley. The words arose after a retreat here - which i attended - went terribly wrong; where our own individual ambitions and pride led to great suffering for one sick retreatant. Jetsunma said we took years off his life. We simply did not see - did not want to see - the gravity of the situation, because we were intent on accomplishing our own prescription of view. What she so skillfully and sharply pointed out, when it became clear what had happened, was that without compassion and awareness of others there can be no accomplishment on this path. Not ever.<br />The Valley is a training ground - for becoming aware of the environment and what needs to be done - and then doing it. Of recognising when plants and animals are stressed for nourishment, and feeding them. Of offering to others that which may ease their lives, or bring them joy. Being awake, attentive, responsive. Always. Being courageous, fearless, selfless, tireless. These are the seeds from which wisdom and compassion will grow. So that little by little a shift can occur; you <strong>will</strong> notice the sick or dying, and tend to them without hesitation. Any other choice will eventually not even be an option. This is the promise of the Valley, if you let it work with you. It offers the method and its result.<br />As I was pondering this post - sentences forming and dissolving in my mind - i spied an object laying between some potted plants and the wall of the house. On investigation it proved to be an old wooden moustrap, now rusted and pitted with white ant trails, but still intact, with the red outline of a mouse and the word ' Victor' clearly visible. I am perplexed at having found it - I water those plants every few days, and have done so for years; this trap is weathered and worn. Yet I am also not suprised, for I have learned that my environment is not always as fixed as I imagine, and that I may discover that which I had never before seen. It seemed appropriate to have found it today, in line with my contemplations. A notion of victory which really is hollow, the poor hapless mouse trapped by its own naive hunger. </div>
<div align="justify">We forget, I think, in our ambitious race to achieve what we think is of value, just how much pain and harm we may inflict on others. That the result may not be what we expected; its taste may be curdled, not sweet. And that this race can never be won, no matter how swift or certain we are; we will never be victors in a world without caring. The loss will always be ours - intimately, personally, painfully. Tragically. It will be our, it will be our world's, greatest sorrow. </div>
