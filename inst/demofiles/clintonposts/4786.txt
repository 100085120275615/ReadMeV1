<p>The Washington Monthly has a nice article on the, ahem, <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2006/0607.benen.html">family values</a> of the three favorites for the Grand Old Police Blotter's 2008 Presidential nomination, and it's devastating:</p>

<blockquote>Last month, The New York Times published a 2,000-word, front-page dissection of Bill and Hillary Clinton's marriage. It contained no real news, few named sources, and plenty of gossip masquerading as political coverage. Observing that the Clintons typically spend 14 days of each month together--hardly unusual for a couple that includes a senator and a peripatetic former president--the Times opted for the half-empty conclusion that the two lead "largely separate lives." The story also made an oblique reference to a Canadian politician named Belinda Stronach, the significance of which would likely be grasped only by insiders and people who read tabloids at supermarket check-outs. In a cover article last year, the Globe claimed that Stronach and Clinton were more than just good friends.</blockquote>

<p>The New York Times piece was shit.  No real story, certainly no evidence, frankly it had Ken "The Closet Heterosexual" Mehlman's sweaty pawprints all over it.  But the Clintons, whatever the state of the marriage, are still together.  The GOP has some liabilities in its heavy hitters:</p>

<blockquote>Lurking just over the horizon are liabilities for three Republicans who have topped several national, independent polls for the GOP's favorite 2008 nominee: Sen. John McCain (affair, divorce), former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (affair, divorce, affair, divorce), and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani (divorce, affair, nasty divorce). Together, they form the most maritally challenged crop of presidential hopefuls in American political history.

<p>..</p>

<p>But it wasn't until 2000 that McCain, possibly emboldened by Clinton's survival of his scandals, became the first confessed adulterer to have the nerve to run. Now, just a few years after infidelity was considered a dealbreaker for a presidential candidate, the party that presents itself as the arbiter of virtue may field an unprecedented two-timing trifecta.</p>

<p><b>McCain was still married and living with his wife in 1979 while, according to The New York Times' Nicholas Kristof, "aggressively courting a 25-year-old woman who was as beautiful as she was rich." McCain divorced his wife, who had raised their three children while he was imprisoned in Vietnam, then launched his political career with his new wife's family money</b>. In 2000, McCain managed to deflect media questioning about his first marriage with a deft admission of responsibility for its failure. It's possible that the age of the offense and McCain's charmed relationship with the press will pull him through again, but Giuliani and Gingrich may face a more difficult challenge. Both conducted well-documented affairs in the last decade--while still in public office.</p>

<p><b>Giuliani informed his second wife, Donna Hanover, of his intention to seek a separation in a 2000 press conference.</b> The announcement was precipitated by a tabloid frenzy after Giuliani marched with his then-mistress, Judith Nathan, in New York's St. Patrick's Day parade, an acknowledgement of infidelity so audacious that Daily News columnist Jim Dwyer compared it with "groping in the window at Macy's." <b>In the acrid divorce proceedings that followed, Hanover accused Giuliani of serial adultery, alleging that Nathan was just the latest in a string of mistresses, following an affair the mayor had had with his former communications director.</b></p>

<p><b>But the most notorious of them all is undoubtedly Gingrich, who ran for Congress in 1978 on the slogan, "Let Our Family Represent Your Family."</b> (He was reportedly cheating on his first wife at the time). In 1995, an alleged mistress from that period, Anne Manning, told Vanity Fair's Gail Sheehy: "We had oral sex. He prefers that modus operandi because then he can say, 'I never slept with her.'" <b>Gingrich obtained his first divorce in 1981, after forcing his wife, who had helped put him through graduate school, to haggle over the terms while in the hospital, as she recovered from uterine cancer surgery. In 1999, he was disgraced again, having been caught in an affair with a 33-year-old congressional aide while spearheading the impeachment proceedings against President Clinton.</b></blockquote></p>

<p>(Emphasis Added).</p>

<p>Now, I'd be the last person to recklessly condemn someone for getting a divorce.  I've known a number of good people who simply couldn't work it out.  I've even seen infidelity rear its ugly head in a couple of friends marriages.  But then again, they never ran for office on platforms attacking gay people for threatening marriage, while divorcing their present wife recovering from cancer surgery.  They never tried to hold themselves up as the champions of "family values" that these clowns do.</p>

<p>Yeah, yeah, Monica Lewinsky, blah, blah.  Bill Clinton was wrong.  The difference is, he admitted it, live, on national television.  We're still waiting on Rudy, Newt, and Mr. Straight-Talk Express to be open and honest about it.</p>

<p>And as a personal note, Rudy Giuliani is not a serious Presidential candidate in 2008, no matter what the Beltway Kool Kidz think.  Even if he wins Iowa and New Hampshire (ain't happening), the first time he ventures into the Deep South, his opponents will absolutely slaughter him in a barrage of attack ads that will make the "McCain had a black baby out wedlock" push-polling look benign by comparison.</p>

<p>Disgusting people, Republicans.</p>
