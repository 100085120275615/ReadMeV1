Call me cynical, but when the Democrats trot out an "initiative" touted as an "opportunity agenda" I assume they mean an opportunity for them to take my money and an opportunity for me to become dependent on the government. That was my reaction when I heard about the announcement of the Democratic Leadership Council's <a href="http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?contentid=253993&kaid=86&amp;subid=194">American Dream Initiative</a>, which was announced by Sen. Hillary Clinton yesterday.<br /><br />The description of this thinly disguised big government program shows that the Dems are obviously hoping to get America's votes the old fashioned way: buying them with offers of money for nothing.<br /><br />The sad fact is, they picked a bad time for this message. While the DLC bemoans the fading away of the American Dream, more Americans are living that dream than ever before.<br /><br />Much of the Liberal's Dream Intitiative is simply unneccessary, and the DLC's own numbers prove it. Let's take a look at the "pillars" of their agenda.<br /><br />1. Every American should have the opportunity and responsibility to go to college and earn a degree, or to get the lifelong training they need.<br /><br />Sidebar: I love the way they use the word "responsibility" throughout this document, it almost makes them sound like rugged individualists.<br /><br />Okay, according to the DLC's narrative of this plan:<br /><br /><blockquote>Over the past 20 years, the United States has made some progress in the percentage of young people who go to college: 63 percent of high school graduates go to college right away; 80 percent go on to some form of college within eight years.</blockquote>Eighty percent of high school graduates attend some college within eight years of graduation! I think that's awesome! Under the original GI Bill 7.8 million WWII veterans attended college by the time the program ended in 1956 (<a href="http://www.gibill.va.gov/GI_Bill_Info/history.htm">source</a>). That is less than half of the total number of veterans who returned from the war. It was a great program, but the high school seniors of today are managing to make it to college at a much, much higher rate.<br /><br />Of course to the Democrats the success of American's acheiving higher education on their own must be made to look like a failure. So the DLC tells us that the real problem is that too many drop out before earning their degree. The reason, presumably, is that they could no longer afford to attend, but no proof of the reasons these students pursue other options is offered. Perhaps they drop out to hop aboard the roaring steam engine known as the US economy, or they decide to marry and raise a family (known to liberals as domestic slavery and legalized rape).<br /><br />So, the DLC wants to implement a plan to ensure that more students graduate with a degree.<br /><blockquote>We offer a plan to produce 1 million more college and community college graduates a year by 2015 -- so that within a decade, America will be a nation in which more than half the young people finish college with a degree, and any student willing to work part-time or perform community service can go to four years of college tuition-free.</blockquote>How generous of them. No doubt they plan on encouraging private investment in scholarship programs to fund this. Why do I get the feeling that I will be unable to save for my own children's educations because the Dems will be taking more of my paycheck to pay for someone else's kid to go?<br /><br />2. Every worker should have the opportunity and responsibility to save for a secure retirement.<br /><br />I was hoping (but not expecting) to see here a proposal for fixing Social Security as I know that was such a priority for the Congressional Democrats in the past, as evidenced by their coming together to kill any reform of a hopelessly broken system.<br /><br />Instead, the Dems are calling for regulations to force employers of even very small companies to pay into retirement plans out of their own and their employees pockets. Is it just me, or do we have that already? I think we call it Social Security. The DLC calling for a secure retirement for all is like CBS calling for honesty in news reporting!<br /><br />3. Every business should have the opportunity to grow and prosper in the strongest private economy on earth, and the responsibility to equip workers with the same tools of success as management.<br /><br />This one is fun! The narrative slams the tax cuts for shifting the burden from the wealthy to the middle class and claims that the average American is much worse off than he was in the 90's (read: Under Clinton).<br /><br />When Bush took office, the economy was in a downturn. Added to this was the impact of corporate scandals and then the 9/11 attacks. But, according to <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/467qwpza.asp">Irwin Stelzer</a> at the Weekly Standard:<br /><br /><blockquote>In the years before the [Bush]tax cuts made themselves fully felt, the economy grew at the puny rates of 0.8 percent and 1.6 percent, respectively. Then, things picked up--to 2.7 percent in 2003, 4.2 percent in 2004, 3.5 percent in 2005, and a torrid 5.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, before cooling to an estimated 3 percent in the second quarter.</blockquote>As for jobs, Stelzer points out that since August of 2003 "5.4 million new jobs have been created." All done without the DLC's agenda for more regulation of businesses, the real engines of the economy. Currently we are at a level economists consider "full employment."<br /><br />Meanwhile, today brought more bad economic news for the DLC as <a href="http://today.reuters.com/investing/financeArticle.aspx?type=bondsNews&storyID=2006-07-25T204402Z_01_N25166243_RTRIDST_0_ECONOMY-WRAPUP-2-REPEAT.XML">consumer confidence rose.</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pdupont/?id=110008699">Pete Du Pont</a> at Opinion Journal has more economic stats including:<br /><br /><blockquote>Mr. Bush signed the most recent tax cuts into law in the spring of 2003. In the past 33 months the size of America's entire economy has increased by 20%--or, as National Review Online's Larry Kudlow put it, "In less than three years, the U.S. economic pie has expanded by $2.2 trillion, an output add-on that is roughly the same size as the total Chinese economy."</blockquote>You read correctly, our economy has grown by a factor equal to the entire economy of China! Du Pont also had this to say:<br /><br /><blockquote>The unemployment rate dropped from 6.1% when the bills were signed to 5.4% at the end of 2004 and 4.6% today, and the rate has gone down for men, women, blacks and Hispanics. Hourly wage rates for workers are up 3.9% in the past year, and they increased at an annualized rate of 4.6% in the second quarter of this year, the highest quarterly rate in nearly 10 years.</blockquote>And this:<br /><br /><blockquote>As Stephen Moore noted in The Wall Street Journal, "the percentage of Americans earning more than $50,000 a year rose from 40.8% to 44.2%" between 2002 and 2004. As for very wealthy families, the portion of total income "captured by the richest 1%, 5% and 10% of Americans is lower today than in the last year of the Clinton administration." </blockquote>So much for the liberal lie that only the rich have benefited!<br /><br />And all of this growth has meant record revenues for government. Tax rates went down but revenues are climbing. Except in places like here in Illinois where our Governor and Democrat controlled legislature have been unable to catch the wave that virtually every other state has. In fact, we have the <a href="http://www.lincolncourier.com/story.asp?SID=2245&amp;SEC=8">largest deficit of any state!</a> Nice to be first in something!<br /><br />Do you really want the DLC tinkering with something that is moving in the right direction faster than it ever did when they held office?<br /><br />4. Every individual should have the opportunity and responsibility to start building wealth from day one, and the security and community that come from owning a home.<br /><br />Okay, I won't even link to a story on this one, because we all know that home ownership is at the highest rate ever! Somehow, all those suffering folks who aren't making a decent living have been able to buy houses. In fact, since Bush took office, my wife and I have been among those buying a home for the first time in our lives. I guess that makes me a wealthy oppressor!<br /><br />But, get this:<br /><blockquote>Baby Bonds...The United States should follow Tony Blair's lead in Britain by providing a Baby Bond to each of the 4 million children born in America each year. A $500 savings bond at birth and again 10 years later would give young people from low- and middle-income families a stake in upward mobility.</blockquote>Baby Bonds!? A $500 bond costs $250 at purchase date. Now, assume a constant birtrate of 4 million a year. Assume also that these 4 million survive each year until age 10. Every year we shell out for 8 million bonds at $250 each (half for the newbies and half for the 10 year olds). I'm no math wizard, but that amounts to something like $2,000,000,000 per year!<br /><br />I've got a better idea, make the tax cuts permanent, then I can earn more, save more and the government will receive increased revenues instead of wasting billions on idiotic spending programs like Baby Bonds!<br /><br />5. Every family should have the opportunity to afford health insurance for their children, and the responsibility to obtain it.<br /><br />Here the DLC makes references to the need to kill unborn babies to explore new cures and never mentions tort reform as a possible way to stem rising health costs. They promote universal child health care as well. What they don't mention in this section is what they do mention under the college education plank, that 85% of all Americans have health coverage. I have news for them, most of us with health care want them to keep their hands off of it!<br /><br />6. In order to expand opportunity for all Americans, we must demand a new ethic of responsibility from Washington: to put government's priorities back in line with our values -- and its books back in balance -- by getting rid of wasteful corporate subsidies, unchecked bureaucracy, and narrow-interest loopholes; collecting taxes that are owed; clamping down on tens of billions of dollars in improper payments and no bid-contracts; and restoring commonsense budgeting principles like pay-as-you-go.<br /><br />Sidebar: Under this plank the DLC uses the word God for the second time (in both cases referring to "God-given" in the sense of God-given potential and talent). The first draft no doubt includes vomit stains, because I can't imagine dems mentioning God without getting violently ill. In any case, they clearly are still trying to reach those "morality voters" by sprinkling a little religion in their document.<br /><br />I agree that we need to balance the books. Given the affect of tax cuts on revenue, I assume the dems would be in favor of more cuts to ensure continued growth. I also think the Congressional Republicans should get serious about acting like fiscal conservatives, and Bush needs to pull out his veto pen.<br /><br />But after hearing about Baby Bonds, I just can't believe the DLC is seriously hoping to convince us that they would control spending any better.
