<br />Elspeth Reeve, over at the <span>New Republic</span>, argues that liberals fear Ann Coulter:<br />
<span class="articlecontent">
<blockquote>I love Ann Coulter. Coulter shocks and offends, but underneath her offensiveness is a grain of truth that people cope with by critiquing her hair. Americans like comfort: comfort food, comfort shoes, comfort pundits to reinforce everything we already believe. Ann Coulter is not comfort. I love that she pisses people off. I love her outsized confidence, rare in females who've gone through puberty, which means she doesn't turn into a pile of stuttering mush when an interview turns to her body. I love the way her face flickers devilishly for just a second when an interviewer wraps his own noose--the joy tinged with a bit of sadness, as if to say, Oh what fun this is, but do you have to make it so easy?<br />....<br />
<span class="articlecontent">Coulter is a pretty woman who holds up a mirror showing us the ugliest parts of ourselves. She makes nice liberals think bad thoughts--particularly about whether they would have sex with her. Which is why we often fight back dirty, talking about her looks. </span>

<br />What delicious irony -- the feminist ideal of a strong woman finally emerges and it isn't Hillary..., it Ann! And the sexist weenies she roasts aren't Republicans.<br />
<br />You go girl!!!</div>
