It is called <i>Fri virkning</i> (Fri haekling). I guess I have to return it to the library soon, but it feels stupid sometimes to return books that you want to keep! </p>
<p>I read it from first page to last today and got lots of ideas. There are no amigurumis in it, but lots of other crochet ideas that is, yes very 1970-stylish, but also very very colourful and fun!</p>
<p>I want to crochet bags and hats, freeform scarfs and other crocheted stuff from this book. They&#8217;ve even made some sweaters! And the mittens, awww so cool! In all it&#8217;s a very inspiring book by a danish author called <b>Lis Paludan</b>. I will have to buy it if I find it in a flea market some day. </p>

The other nordic countries are much better than Sweden to publish great craft books. This one is not as colourfull, but has great tutorials on different crochet technics and  a couple of pages with colours (the other pic&#8217;s are b/w).</p>
<p>In the mail I got <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/" target="_blank">Hillary&#8217;s</a> pattern book with softies and also her adorable set of postcards. Who will ever be worthy of one of these? :-)</p>
