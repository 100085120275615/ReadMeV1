globalization:

Shopping for Support Down the Wrong Aisle, by Sebastian Mallaby, Commentary, 
Washington Post</a>: Once upon a time, smart Democrats defended globalization, 
open trade and the companies that thrive within this system. ... Then dot-bombs 
and Enron punctured corporate America's prestige, and Democrats bolted. Rather 
than hammer legitimately on real instances of corporate malfeasance -- 
accounting scandals, out-of-control executive compensation and the like -- 
Democrats swallowed the whole anti-corporate playbook. </p>
<p>To see the difference between then and now, just look at the Clintons. In the 
late 1980s and early 1990s, Hillary Clinton sat on Wal-Mart's board; and when 
Sam Walton died in 1992, Bill Clinton lauded him as "a wonderful family man and 
one of the greatest citizens in the history of the state of Arkansas.'' 
Campaigning in the New Hampshire primary that year, Bill Clinton came proudly to 
the rescue of a local company called American Brush Co. by helping it become a 
Wal-Mart supplier. </p>
<p>Times change. Last year Hillary Clinton returned a campaign contribution from 
Wal-Mart... The nation's most successful retailer, which has seized the 
opportunities created by globalization ... is now seen as too toxic to touch. 
... Clinton is not alone... Joe Lieberman, who holds fast to his principles on 
the Iraq war, recently abandoned his centrist economic credentials by appearing 
at an anti-Wal-Mart rally. No matter that Lieberman once served as chairman of 
the business-friendly Democratic Leadership Council. ...</p>
<p>After Lieberman ... stepped down as chairman of the DLC, he was succeeded by 
Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. Well, Bayh recently showed up at an anti-Wal-Mart 
rally, too, as has Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack, who is the current DLC chairman. ... 
Harry Reid, the Democrats' Senate leader, appeared at an anti-Wal-Mart event on 
Saturday, and Sen. Joe Biden and Gov. Bill Richardson popped up at earlier 
stops. ...</p>
<p>How can supposedly centrist Democrats defend this betrayal of their 
principles? Some claim that their beliefs are consistent, but that the company 
has changed: The Wal-Mart of the early 1990s mainly bought American, whereas 
today's irresponsible monster buys cheap stuff from China. But this argument 
merely illustrates how far Democrats have come. Since when did the party's 
centrists believe that trading with China is evil? It was the Clinton 
administration that brought China into the World Trade Organization. </p>
<p>Other Democrats reaffirm their centrist credentials while calling upon 
Wal-Mart to pay workers more. ... But the idea that Wal-Mart pays below-market 
wages is false. Otherwise nobody would work there. Hillary Clinton and Sen. John 
Kerry have attacked Wal-Mart for offering health coverage to too few workers. 
But Kerry's former economic adviser, Jason Furman of New York University, 
concluded in a paper ... that Wal-Mart's health benefits are about as generous 
as those of comparable employers. Moreover, Clinton and Kerry know perfectly 
well that market pressures limit the health coverage that companies can provide. 
After all, both senators have proposed expansions in government health provision 
precisely on the premise that the private sector can't pay for all of it. </p>
<p>The truth is that none of these Democrats can resist dumb economic populism. 
...[T]he DLC crowd is pandering shamelessly to the left of the party... For a 
party that needs the votes of Wal-Mart's customers, this is a questionable 
strategy. But there is more than politics at stake. According to a paper for the 
National Bureau of Economic Research by Jerry Hausman and Ephraim Leibtag, 
neither of whom received funding from Wal-Mart, big-box stores led by Wal-Mart 
reduce families' food bills by one-fourth. Because Wal-Mart's price-cutting also 
has a big impact on the non-food stuff it peddles, it saves U.S. consumers 
upward of $200 billion a year, making it a larger booster of family welfare than 
the federal government's $33 billion food-stamp program. </p>
<p>How can centrist Democrats respond to that? By beating up Wal-Mart and 
forcing it to focus on public relations rather than opening new stores, 
Democrats are harming the poor Americans they claim to speak for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the answer to the question of why centrist Democrats have shifted 
their stance on globalization is straightforward - the gains from globalization 
have not been shared equally. The claims made in the 1990s about the benefits of 
globalization have not been realized and it's no longer wise politically to 
assert that globalization will benefit typical households. With stagnant real 
wages and other economic problems such as declining health care coverage, 
Wal-Mart is an obvious and glaring symbol to many of the failed promises of 
globalization, and lower priced imported goods do not overcome the failed 
promises the symbol represents. </p>
<p>I continue to support global economic integration, I am not a Wal-Mart basher, and I think the anti Wal-Mart campaign is 
misplaced (though I do have concerns about the extent to which it exploits its market power in input markets). But I also think it is important for Democrats to acknowledge their role in 
pushing for globalization in the past, and show they understand that the very unequal 
benefits that globalization has brought about requires us to rethink how to 
protect the most vulnerable from its effects.</p></div>
