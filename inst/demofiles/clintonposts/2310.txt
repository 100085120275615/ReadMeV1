<p>"<span>I won't [fly United again], and I hope no other black person will fly them either,"</span> she told the Daily News<br />
<br />
<span>TV star Mo'Nique got kicked off a United Airlines flight Sunday after getting into a spat with a flight attendant... </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>[The] incident started when her hair stylist stashed a hair dryer in a first-class bin. While Mo'Nique was flying in the front of the cabin, her aide was in coach., and this time the comedian isn't laughing - she's crying racism.  </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>
<span>"This happens to black people all the time</span>, and they don't have a voice. I have a voice."<br />
</span>
</p>
</ul>Maybe it is nothing more than airline regulations that are applied to everyone, regardless of their color?   No wait...it's because she's black...(sigh).<br />- - -<br />** </span>
