<div>Lawrence O'Donnell writes that <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-odonnell/joe-lieberman-will-drop-o_b_27006.html">Lieberman will drop out of the race recently.</a>  O'Donnell states that Lieberman will have lost any party support now to Ned Lamont the party's chosen candidate.<blockquote>Joe Lieberman will drop out. He probably knows right now that the day will come in late September when he will announce his withdrawal from the race. No one is going to have to talk him into it. By that time, the Democratic Party power structure will be doing its thing for Ned Lamont and Lieberman will be trailing by double digits.<br />
<br />It wonât be a hard decision for Lieberman. He will drop out to avoid career-ending humiliation.<br />
<br />Lieberman came within four points of Lamont by climbing up on the shoulders of the biggest names in the party including ClintonâBill and Hillary. Liebermanâs TV commercial starring Bill Clinton was his best. Now, both Clintons and everyone else in the Party are carrying Lamont on their shoulders. By late September, Bill Clinton will be onstage hugging his new best friend and starring in Lamont commercials. Connecticutâs much better liked senator, Chris Dodd, will be campaigning for Lamont this time. The Clinton and Dodd defections will cost Lieberman ten points in Connecticut. If Dick Cheney continues to say nice things about Lieberman, itâll cost him another ten points. And Lieberman campaigning alone, all alone, will look bitter, very bitter. His smile will look faker than ever. Voters arenât drawn to bitter.</blockquote>Lieberman has said he will not quit but Bill Weld said he would not quit in his run for Governor after the party convention chose Faso.</div>
