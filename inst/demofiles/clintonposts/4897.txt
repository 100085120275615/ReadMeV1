<p>Why is it that no one in the media has bothered to analyze the aspiring presidential candidate from New York's forced amended FEC report, filed on January 30, 2006, in complete media silence?

<p>After agreeing to amend the false FEC filings that resulted in Hillary finance director David Rosen's indictment and trial for election fraud, Hillary's campaign treasurer Andrew Grossman's latest amended report, filed on January 30, 2006, perpetuates the fraud begun by Hillary herself days after Event 39's political issues were reported in the Washington Post in August, 2000.</p>
