<div align="left">1) Contact your Representatives and Senators to support U.S. Congressman <a href="http://www.culberson.house.gov/news.aspx?A=171">John Culberson's (R-Texas) push for legislation to create a citizen border patrol (HR 3622.)</a> The members of a citizen border patrol would be deputized to make arrests, and authorized to carry a firearm. (see lower left of this page for your Congressional contacts.)<br /></div><div align="left"><br />2) Contact your State Representatives (<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050921/ap_on_re_us/deadly_force">especially if you live in Michigan</a>) and urge them to enact a law allowing citizens the right to actually defend themselves, rather than require them to run away. I know this concept may be in stark contrast to the Clinton Military Doctrine of "tucking tail and running" and the inscrutable strategy of"snatching defeat from the jaws of victory," as espoused by our fine anti-war activists (see <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/">Michelle Malkin's A Day Among the Moonbats for photos</a>. Yipes!) This law would not prohibit you from exercising the aforementioned strategies of conflict avoidance, but it can't hurt that when you are defending yourself and your family, you are actually allowed to, um, defend yourself and your family. Sarah Brady's concern is that we're "<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050921/ap_on_re_us/deadly_force">going to get the right to use them [firearms] willy-nilly</a>." To show that we are not above compromise, I encourage you to ask your Congressmen to take the phrase "willy-nilly" out of any pending legislation. Who says we can't work together?</div><div align="left"></div><div align="left"><br />3) Honor a true American Hero, Rick Rescorla, by going to <a href="http://www.politicalnightmare.com/">Political Nightmare</a>, and reading the inspiring and heartbreaking account of his last day on Earth, and then sign the <a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/pmfrick/petition.html">online petition to award him the Presidential Medal of Freedom</a>.<br /></div><p><br />4) If you haven't done so already, help honor more American Heroes by signing the <a href="http://takebackthememorial.org/">Take Back the Memorial Petition</a> and the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/flni/pphtml/contact.html">Flight 93 Memorial contact form</a>.</p><p><br />5) Now go relax and enjoy yourself. Hug your kid, hug a tree or hug a cold one; read a book, go for a walk, visit an elderly relative; I don't care what you do, just enjoy yourself and your family! Why are you still reading this? Go do something! </p>
