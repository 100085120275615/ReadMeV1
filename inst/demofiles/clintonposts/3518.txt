<div>Senate Majority leader Bill Frist's answer to runaway health-care spending is to cap jury awards in medical malpractice suits -- for the fifth time in four years, he tried and failed to cap awards at $250,000 during his self-proclaimed "Health Care Week" in May.<br />
<br />    But how's this for a novel approach?: Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama also want to save on health care, but rather than capping jury awards, they hope to cut the number of medical malpractice cases by reducing medical errors, as they explain in the <a href="http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/354/21/2205">
<em>New England Journal of Medicine.</em>
</a>
<br />
<br />Supporting this approach is a recent study out of the <a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/press/releases/press05102006.html">Harvard School of Public Health that showed that the legal system does a good job of weeding out claims without merit</a>.<br />
