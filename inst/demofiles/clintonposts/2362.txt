<span>Hereâs an interesting tale about China, Google, the 9/11 Commission, leftist lawyers, terrorist defenders, selling out your country out to the highest bidder, Hillary Clinton and Jamey Gorelick!<br />
<br />The worldâs biggest law firm <strong>Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP</strong> opened up shop in China in November 2004. They also happen to be lawyers for GOOGLE, who recently agreed to allow China to censor them.<br />
<br />Amongst the firms many legal triumphs is the infamous McCain-Feingold bill.<br />
<br />
<strong>Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP</strong> represented Senators McCain and Feingold in getting legislation passed to make it illegal (in some cases) for citizens to donate money to political campaigns.<br />
<br />Thus trampling your constitutionally guaranteed first amendment rights to political free speech.<br />
<br />However thatâs small change to them. They make most of their vast income out of tax-payers. You, the citizen. Thatâs BILLIONS of dollars, from suing the US government, representing the US government, banks, multi-national corporations, state government.<br />
<br />In other words, ultimately... you pay their huge fees whether through taxes, goods and services.<br />
<br />Guess who happens to be a senior partner in this firm? Why none other than...</span>

<strong>Jamey Gorelick of 9/11 cover-up fame!<br />
</strong>
<br />Here's another interesting factoid: Remember a couple of years back, when there was a rush by US lawyers to GuantÃ¡namo Bay on their own time, to offer their services free to terrorists who are not US citizens and who are not detained in the US â and who hadnât asked for them.<br />
<br />They've been busy little Bees ever since filing lawsuits whose sole aim and purpose is to derail the war against Islamo- terrorism, and to cripple the US ability to gather intelligence to stop another 9/11.<br />
<br />Well you guessed, the leading law firm defending these foreign terrorists held in Gitmo pro bono (for free) is...<br />
<br />
<strong>Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale and Dorr LLP</strong>
<br />
<br />(They also provided 3 high powered lawyers to the 9/11 Commission and staff, to work alongside Gorelick.)<br />
<br />So I wrote to the firm asking them, given their great concern about the rights of terrorists enquiring what steps, if any, their firm was taking to offer Chinese citizens pro bono services regarding illegal detention by the People's Republic of China.<br />
<br />I was particularly interested in what services they may be offering Chinese citizens regarding accusations of torture, political repression, or even those accused of criminal activity, which, as we know, can quite often be a cover for political repression.<br />
<br />You wonât be surprised to learn that the answer I received from a PR flack is NOTHING. I guess the desire to make billions in China trumps that concern.<br />
<br />Given that they also represent GOOGLE who also want to make billions in China, that understandable, right?<br />
<br />Some other interesting facts about <strong>Jamey Gorelick</strong>: one of Hillary Clintonâs best friends...<br />
<br />
<strong>Gorelick</strong> used to be Vice Chairman of Fannie Mae, until she bailed as it was going under to join the main law firm representing Fannie Mae. Again that would be Wilmer, Blab, Blah<br />
<br />Oh Jamey, what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive<br />
<br />So here we have the situation. <strong>Jamey Gorelick</strong> was the Clintonoid government hack who..<br />
<br />1. Stopped the FBI and CIA working together to thwart terrorist plots that culminated in 3000 dead on 9/11.<br />
<br />2. Who used the 9/11 commission to cover up the Clinton administration's criminal neglect of Muslim terrorism which led to 3000 dead at the WTC.<br />
<br />3. Whose firm at which she is Senior Partner is now working flat out (for free) to free those dangerous terrorists.<br />
<br />4. Whose firm represents Google, which agrees to censor itself in China.<br />
<br />If we're going to talk Jack Abramoff (which we should) then how about CONNECTING THESE DOTS AS WELL? </span>
