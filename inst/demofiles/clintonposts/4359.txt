<p><strong>So will Hillary run for President in 2008?</strong> By looking at the way she is campaining and the amount of the donations she is bringing in <u><a target="_blank" href="http://www.observer.com/20060724/20060724_Jason_Horowitz_pageone_coverstory1.asp">(read this article, &#8220;The Hillionaire&#8221;)</a></u>, it seems that she has her sights on the more than just the &#8216;06 Senate reelection.</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.forbes.com/home/2006/06/30/hillary-clinton-president-cx_np-0703oxford.html">this article in Forbes</a>  (a summary of an <em>Oxford Analytica </em>article), while she is likely to win the Democrat Primary, she could have trouble winning the actual election (though many voters like her, others hate her). As Forbes says it, she is very &#8220;polarizing.&#8221; The article emphasizes the importance of her Republican opponent in deciding weather she can win or not.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/19/poll.presidential/index.html">This poll</a> taken in June by CNN seems to verify that Hillary would have trouble winning the actual 2008 Presidential election. 47% of those polled say that they definitely would not vote for Hillary. 22% say they definitely would vote for her. The poll seems to have been done correctly, with a sampling error of +-3 percentage points, and a sample size of 1,001 adults.</p>
<p><strong>My conclusion is that Hillary Clinton is not likely to win the Presidential Election in 2008. </strong>I have no idea if she will run or not, but if she does run, I don&#8217;t believe that she can win. This is, of course, not taking into account future Republican errors, which could give the election to the Democratic Party!
