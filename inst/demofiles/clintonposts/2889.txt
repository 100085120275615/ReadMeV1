<div>And is there really anything more you need to say about the Mainstream Media in the USA, or indeed the World?<br />
<br />You can start with the newspaper with The Record - Ooops! - that is, the newspaper <em>of</em> record - yeahhh, riiight! - and just keep going. Pick a major news broadcast on television. Go ahead, pick one!<br />
<br />Any of them you'd trust your life with, when it comes to accuracy, or even honesty, in their reportage?<br />
<br />What is this cute trick, this sleight-of-hand that the Media keeps pulling? First, you create a crisis, a problem. You don't need an actual problem, no indeed! Make one up! Don't think that happens? Next time you read a crisis or scandal headline in a major newspaper - The Bucks County Courier-Times is <b>not</b> a major newspaper! - read the entire article! Not just the headline and the subheading. Read the whole thing. <br />
<br />Now, what do you find when it's about George Bush, or the Administration? Or about a Republican? You find an accusation in the headline, don't you? And the subhead will back up the accusation. Now, when you get deeper into the article, do you notice something odd? No? How about attributed quotes?<br />
<br />Don't know what that is? That's something like this: "When asked what sort of government the Congress had created for the young Nation, Mister Franklin responded, 'A Republic, if you can keep it!'"<br />
<br />What do you get from this? That <em>Mister Franklin</em> had something to say. He's quoted and given the <em>attribution</em>. That's an <em>attributed quote</em>! Not an unamed source (a janitor? A clerk? Who?) that you can't pin down. Do you trust unamed sources? If you do you're stupid.<br />
<br />Sorry, there's no other way to describe someone who accepts any reporter's unamed source as believable. Time to get a clue, Friend!<br />
<br />So without a damning quote from a named source with evidence of wrong-doing, what can you do to further the lie that there is a problem?<br />
<br />Well, you pad the article with analysis. Oh, you don't call it that. Not yet, you don't. But you get enemies of your target to badmouth them, put them in a venal light, denounce and degrade them. In short - because you are the media and you can get away with it - you libel your target. <br />
<br />Yet, you still probably haven't read what the headline described did you? That's because you are wising up! Maybe. You see, it doesn't matter if the headline is backed up by the article. Not if you are a Republican, or G.W.Bush. The headlines are all that many ever read, if they waste their time on a newspaper in the first place. <br />
<br />And if they read further, they will get the latest Democratic Party 'Talking Points'. Why? Because reporters are not only biased - they deny, but then we already know they lie, so... - but they are incredibly lazy! If they aren't handed something: a leak, a sneaked photo, some phony papers, they won't write a thing. So they live on the Democrat Hand-out. No? Next time there's a scandal, peruse the websites of the Networks(ABC, NBC, etc.), the major newspapers, even listen to the radio for the news, or listen to (Lord protect us!) NPR.<br />
<br />What will you hear? The exact same words. Whatever the talking points of the Democrat party, you will the same parroted lines from every Dem who is interviewed, from every talking head on TV, from the NPR leaches, in the newspapers, and so on.<br />
<br />Funny how they all think the ame things at the same times, eh?<br />
<br />Now, if the initial offering of a problem gains no traction, whaddya do? Simple, you do it again, as an update. The interesting thing with the MSM, though, is that you don't have to add anything new! See how clever they are? All you do is retool the articles, reword the headline and subhead. Most folks will never know the difference. And that's exctly what the media wants. They want Americans stupid, placid, agreeable.<br />
<br />Wake up! That's how they infiltrated and destroyed the education system in this country. It's how they wormed their way into every facet of our lives. Don't listen to them! Do your research!<br />
<br />I know, you ain't got the time, it's not supposed to be your job, blah, blah, blah!<br />
<br />Guess what? <em>Now</em> it's <em>your</em> job. Better get to it. Or some fine morning you will wake to an America that is not a Republic anymore. It will resemble the weak-kneed socialism of Europe, but with Bosses, instead of Leaders. <br />
<br />And they might look a lot like Hillary and Bill!</div>
