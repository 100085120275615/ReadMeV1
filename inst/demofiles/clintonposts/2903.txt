<div>Arnie is more concerned with placating MOAMâs (Member Occupying Army of Mexico) than he is about rightful and dutiful citizens. <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/local/states/california/northern_california/14412521.htm">He blasted any wall proposal on Sunday </a>as <br />sending  the wrong message to Mexico, <em>"our friends ... our trading partners."</em>
<br />
<br />
<br />He then invoked the panacea of technology, which he thinks can secure the border. Heâs not alone in this. Madame Hillary talks about electronic and technical measures to build a virtual wall. They want to do it on the cheap. Doesnât anyone have a memory? Havenât the politicos studied history? Do they want to ignore the lessons of history?<br />
<br />This has been tried before. <em>Whiz Kid </em>Robert MacNamara had a plan to seal off the DMZ in South Vietnam using electronic sensors and such. It was a dismal failure. Technology can only do so much. Physical barriers, area denial, and boots on the ground are what works.</div>
