<div><p>The Iraq situation is as bleak and chaotic as ever.&nbsp; The preceding statement is not just my opinion, but <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/08/04/generals_voice_fear_of_civil_war_in_iraq/">the actual view of generals leading the counterinsurgency effort.</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;General Abizaid, the top commander in Iraq, responded to a question posed by Senator Carl Levin of Michigan asking whether Iraq is descending into Civil War by remarking, &quot;I believe that the sectarian violence is probably as bad as I've seen it, in Baghdad in particular, and that if not stopped, it is possible that Iraq could move towards civil war.&quot;&nbsp; Recent months have seen a ratcheting up of the sectarian violence that is claiming the lives of more Iraqis.&nbsp; Our mission to install democracy in Iraq is in obvious peril.&nbsp; </p>

<p>General Abizaid made the above cited comment while being asked questions by a Senate panel.&nbsp; Senator John McCain complained a reassignment of 3,500 American servicemen to Baghdad to quell the deplorable sectarian violence there offered an opportunity for insurgents to spark trouble elsewhere in Iraq.&nbsp; What McCain is saying if one were to read between the lines is the occupying force is not large enough to stamp out the insurgency throughout the country.&nbsp; The only thing is an increase in troop strength is politically untenable, so prospects for a more stable Iraq in the near term look rather dim.&nbsp;  </p>

<p>  Hillary Clinton was not shy in offering her opinion that the administration had managed the war ineptly which is her explanation for the deplorable conditions in Iraq.  There's no question there  have been bad decisions made since Saddam was toppled, but I'm not convinced the outcome would have been all that much different regardless of the way the occupation was managed.   Many Iraqis see the foreign troops as occupiers, so the development of an insurgency probably could not have been prevented even  by a better run occupation.  And even if by some remote chance a better outcome could have been achieved if the occupation had been managed more competently, this point is clearly irrelevant now.  While other Democrats have bailed on the war, Hillary Clinton has continued her unwavering support for the conflict.  While she has shown her mettle and has demonstrated she won't necessarily be swayed by public opinion, Hillary's unflinching support for the war is sure to mean she will get a spirited challenge from the left in 2008 for the Democratic Presidential nomination. <p> 

<p> When prominent generals are forced to acknowledge that things are bad, then at the very least it would seem time to re-evaluate things.  Given the rising sectarian strife and rampant lawlessness in Iraq, it wouldn't be overly bold to declare the Iraq War up to this point has been a dismal failure.  Too many American military men have been sacrificed for a war started on the flimsiest of reasons.  Billions of dollars have been wasted to produce a country teetering on disintegration.   Only the delusional still stubbornly cling to a rosy view of Iraq belied by the steady parade of grim news filtering out of the war torn nation.   Diminished expectations are now the rule as an outcome resembling victory doesn't appear to be in the cards.  There are those who insist a low intensity civil war in Iraq has already commenced.  The mounting death toll of Iraqi civilians during recent months suggest just that.   George W. Bush has certainly made his mark on the Middle East, but so far the results have hardly been stellar.
