  Right now the numbers say Clinton & McCain have huge leads over their nearest competitors.  Hillary has the money, the power, the favors, and the votes.  I don&#8217;t see the progressives as having enough power to run her out, in the end we are going to be seeing progressives making excuses for Hillarys lies and crimes all the way into the 08 election.  You wait&#8230;it&#8217;s gonna happen.</p>
<p>   And I can tell you that the right is NOT AFRAID of McCain, they see him as ELECTABLE&#8230;.he&#8217;s gonna snack on Hillarys side of the isle, the moderates are going with McCain and Hillary will be sunk.  And if the progressives have their way, Hillary will have to move even further to the left&#8230;something shes begging them not to make her do.  Hillary knows that her only hope of winning this thing is to get the moderates to beleive she is moderate.  A hard thing for an anti military liberal who graduated from a lezbian college to do.  But shes making all the right noises right now&#8230;.trying to appear moderate.</p>
<p>Remember when Liberals were begging McCain to cross over and run with Kerry?  Remember libs claiming the reason they hated Bush was because he &#8220;smeared&#8221; McCain (something Bush never did)?  Yes, the former darling of the left, McCain, is now a rapid right wing necon demon they must defeat&#8230;LAUGH.</p>
<p>The proof of the pudding will be who do the people in the middle vote for?  War Hero McCain or Corrupt Hillary?  You guys better start trying to put libstick on that pig you are running because you aren&#8217;t going to be able to really smear McCain to the moderates.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll give you this.  As much as I feel that War-Hero McCain and Never-Served Hillary have their respective party nominations wrapped up&#8230;.we are talking about the future and by definition&#8230;.no one can know for sure.  I think I&#8217;m right, but it&#8217;s obviously not written in stone.</p>
