<p>In light of Joe Lieberman's defeat last night, I felt it would be a good idea to show how these nutroots(netroots) people could pose a similar headache to Hillary down the road. <a href="http://www.nohillaryno.com/">No Hillary No,</a> is a web site created by a liberal to stop Hillary from running in 2008. Get a load of this...</p>

<blockquote>If you think Hillary Clinton is going to win the 2008 election you are either seriously deluded or just plain stupid. I realize that the last few years have been difficult and that many of you have retreated into a fantasy land where a Hillary run makes sense, but here in reality, we know better. Hillary Clinton, regardless of her many qualifications, will never win the presidential election in '08. It simply will not happen and deep down--you know it. The Republicans could run a cross-dressing lipstick smeared Pat Robertson against her and probably win. Little Kenny Mehlman and the crooks who pay his salary and control the RNC are going to, once again, play on the mouth breathing majorities fears and ram another nitwit down our throats. He will appear to be a "moderate" but as soon as he is done taking his oath we will once again get screwed. Think McCain. He has been auditioning for over 6 years now.

<p>I really do not care to repeat the last 6 years. Something has to change.</p>

<p>I am asking Hillary Clinton to forget about Democratic nomination for President in '08 and to remove herself from consideration. She needs to put an end to the rumors now. She has a job to do as Senator and she needs to focus on doing that job. The Democrats need to field a candidate who can defeat whatever sock puppet the RNC picks. Hillary Clinton is not that candidate. I have nothing against her. She would be a major improvement over the clown currently occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue but facts are facts, she will not receive the votes to become our President. It really is that simple.</blockquote></p>

<p>Yes this may be just one liberal kook, but there is a link on this site to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/05/AR2006050501717.html">an article written by the creator of the blog Daily Chaos(Kos</a>) in the Washington Post. It shows just how difficult they could make a run in 2008 by Hillary. You can easily see that they don't want her to be their candidate.</p>

<blockquote>Hillary Clinton leads her Democratic rivals in the polls and in fundraising. Unfortunately, however, the New York senator is part of a failed Democratic Party establishment -- led by her husband -- that enabled the George W. Bush presidency and the Republican majorities, and all the havoc they have wreaked at home and abroad.

<p>Of course, it's still early. At this point in the last presidential cycle, the first hints of Howard Dean's tr ansformational campaign were barely emerging. In 2002, the Democrats had no clear front-runner, but the conventional wisdom was betting on a handful of insider candidates with money and connections: Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman and John F. Kerry, and Rep. Richard A. Gephardt. These three were supposed to contend. The early polls gave them (especially Lieberman) the inside track to the nomination, and the media gave the rest of the field no more than its usual dismissive coverage.</p>

<p>But the netroots -- the far-flung collection of grassroots political activists organizing online -- proved to be a different world, one unencumbered by Washington's conventional wisdom. Even as the establishment mocked Dean and his supporters ("like a scene out of the 'Star Wars' cantina," laughed a rival campaign aide), his army of hyper-motivated supporters organized across all 50 states. This movement exploded onto the national scene when Dean began reporting dramatically higher fundraising numbers than his opponents. Had Kerry not lent himself millions to reach the Iowa caucuses, and had Dean not been so green a candidate, Dean probably would have been the nominee.</p>

<p>Dean lost, but the point was made. No longer would D.C. insiders impose their candidates on us without our input; those of us in the netroots could demand a say in our political fortunes. Today, however, Hillary Clinton seems unable to recognize this new reality. She seems ill-equipped to tap into the Net-energized wing of her party (or perhaps is simply uninterested in doing so) and incapable of appealing to this newly mobilized swath of voters. She may be the establishment's choice, but real power in the party has shifted.</p>

<p>Our crashing of Washington's gates wasn't about ideology, it was about pragmatism. Democrats haven't won more than 50 percent of the vote in a presidential election since 1976. Heck, we haven't won more than 50.1 percent since 1964. And complicit in that failure was the only Democrat to occupy the White House since 1980: Bill Clinton.</p>

<p>Despite all his successes -- and eight years of peace and prosperity is nothing to sneeze at -- he never broke the 50-percent mark in his two elections. Regardless of the president's personal popularity, Democrats held fewer congressional seats at the end of his presidency than before it. The Democratic Party atrophied during his two terms, partly because of his fealty to his "third way" of politics, which neglected key parts of the progressive movement and reserved its outreach efforts for corporate and moneyed interests.</blockquote></p>

<p>These nutroots folk are hardliners. In reality much like Hillary herself. The problem is the vast majority of people in this country aren't hardline leftwing nutcases. Hillary is smart enough to realize this as was her husband. It gave them two terms in the White House. Apparently this time around, the nutcases in her party won't allow her to do the same. The next two years ought to be fun as we watch Hillary bend over backwards trying to placate this bunch of kooks. :)</p>
