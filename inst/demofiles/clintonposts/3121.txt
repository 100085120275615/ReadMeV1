<div>Hilary Clinton recently said: "Here at home we know it's not just 'choice' that is under attack, it's contraception which is under attack," said Senator Hillary Clinton at a June 13 meeting of the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association.<br />But a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20060622/ts_alt_afp/ussocietyhealthwomencontraception_060622132326">Yahoo </a>story argues that Hilary-feminists are just paranoid - keep your panties on, ladies, we don't want your pills.<br />Until you hear things like this, from a <a href="http://misspenname.blogspot.com/2006/05/christina-page.html">debate </a>between Cristina Page and "American Life League's Jim Sedlak, during which 'she asked him about the sweeping South Dakota abortion ban. His response? It isn't a perfect law. If it were a perfect law, it would ban contraception, too, he said.'"<br />So, if we're not at risk of losing our right to contraception, why do pharmacists refuse to fill the scrips? And why do pro-lifers push for laws that protect them?<br />I'm begging the reporters and journalists out there: next time you think we're being paranoid, visit pro-life sites. Any pro-life sites. Just Google 'pro-life' and take your pick. You will see the words "abortifacent," "abortion-pill," and countless arguments that birth control of any kind is murder (not based on science or medicine, but who needs those when you have the Good Book?).<br />Over at Alternet, <a href="http://www.alternet.org/rights/36371/">Page </a>spells it out for all us better than I can.</div>
