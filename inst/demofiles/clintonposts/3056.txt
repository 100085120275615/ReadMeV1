<br />I really don't see a pattern here to justify profiling, do you? So, to ensure we Americans never offend anyone, particularly fanatics intent on killing us, airport security screeners will no longer be allowed to profile anyone. While not all Muslims are terrorists, [almost] all terrorists are Muslims.<br />
<br />They must conduct random searches of 80-year-old women, little kids, airline pilots with proper identification, secret agents of the President's security detail, 85-year old Congressmen with metal hips, and Medal of Honor winner and former Governor Joe Foss, but leave Muslim males between the ages 17 and 40 alone because of profiling. (it isn't politically correct)<br />
<br />Recall the writer of the award winning story "Forrest Gump" who so aptly put it, "Stupid is as stupid does." Please consider passing this on to everyone in your address book.<br />
<br />Unfortunately as the bumper sticker says .."Some people just need killing, that is why we have Marines."<br />
<br />Our Country and our troops need our support and prayers.</blockquote>
