<div><p>In a move that would turn a Republican into Hitler, Hillary Clinton is blocking reauthorization of the Ryan White Act becasue it lowers funds for her home state.  This is from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/22/AR2006082201161.html">The Washington Post</a>, which took a rare break from attacking George Allen to actually report a Democrat in low light.  The basic gist of the problem:</p>

<blockquote><em>This year's fight has pitted the states in which the AIDS epidemic began -- those with large cities that now have large populations of people with AIDS -- against smaller states in which the incidence of HIV infections, but not full-blown AIDS, has soared. The current law's formula is based on the number of patients with AIDS; the new funding formula would, in effect, distribute funding based on the number of patients with HIV or AIDS.
</em></blockquote>
But politics seems to be in play as well:

<blockquote><em>Some critics see electoral motives behind Clinton's position. "If you look at the states she has to carry to become president -- California, New York, Illinois, Florida -- those would be the hardest hit if the formula were changed," said Charles Grant, founder of AbsoluteCare Medical Center Inc., the largest private HIV/AIDS medical center in Georgia.

<p>Asked why Clinton might countenance lower funding for Southern and rural states, Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the nation's largest community-based HIV/AIDS medical provider, said, "I don't think she expects to carry the South."</em></blockquote></p>

<p>Even if Hillary wasn't thinking politics, something the Post is careful not to accuse (can you imagine if it were Rick Santorum?), this is till narrow minded on Hillary's party.  States like New York, California, Florida, and Illinois are big states with large populations and alot of money.  They can afford themselves to help pick up the tab.  States in the South, like say Louisiana, Arkansas, Alabama, or Mississippi--are small with very little money for basic services, and especially after Katrina for the Gulf Coast, the federal government should put the poorer states at the head of the line.  But apparently Hillary thinks if you have AIDS in a Republican state, you can wait.</p></div>
