<p><strong>DAVID BROOKS, INCAPABLE OF CONNECTING DOTS</strong></p>

<p>David Brooks - with his earnest expression + sheer word&nbsp; count â seems to hold some kind of reputation as a serious thinker. But is he? I am thinking of his red-blue analysis (<a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/2001/12/index.htm">Atlantic Monthly</a> - subscribers only)&nbsp; after the 2000 election in which he used Franklin County, PA â where I grew up, where a good part of my family still lives â as his red sample. Anyone who knows that particular pocket of the world can tell you, he didnât really âgetâ what he was looking at. Not by a long shot. Iâm also thinking of his piece on future leaders, wherein&nbsp; he âgot to knowâ some of Princetonâs best and brightest <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200104/brooks">students</a> (subscription). At the time, I was teaching at a small liberal arts college and every college prof I knew agreed that Brooksâs perceptions were wholly at odds with almost everything we knew of the current college crop, based on years of daily immersion. More recently,&nbsp; his columns in the <em>New York Times</em> regularly draw the most interesting bunch of letters to the editor, wherein<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/13/opinion/l13brooks.html?n=Top%2fOpinion%2fEditorials%20and%20Op%2dEd%2fLetters"> readers</a> (registration required) tear apart his weak arguments in 150 words or less. As inâ¦</p>

<blockquote><p><em>David Brooks claims that Senator Joseph I. Lieberman lost to Ned Lamont because of extremists on the Internet filled with malice. The primary results suggest rather that Mr. Lieberman lost because sensible suburbanites recognized that it was time for him to be replaced... There is nothing malicious or extreme about firing someone for... incompetence on an important project. </em></p>

<p><em>***</em></p>

<p><em>David Brooks castigates the âideologues on the leftâ as being âperpetually two years behind the national mood.â In fact, regarding the fiasco in Iraq and the disastrously incompetent Bush administration, the national mood is finally, three-plus years late, catching up to this so-called ideological left.<br /><br />***</em></p>

<p><em>In Congress, when the chips are down, âmoderateâ Republicans always vote with their radical leadership. That leaves no center for Democrats to make deals with. When Mr. Lieberman compromises, he legitimates the hard rightâs legislation without winning any concessions for his side.</em></p>

<p><em>Nor is Mr. Brooksâs party a party of civility. It is not civil of Mr. Lieberman to echo Karl Rove in calling his own party weak on national security because it opposes reckless and counterproductive wars. It is not civil of Mr. Brooks to put a gentlemanly and genuinely moderate Greenwich businessman like Ned Lamont on a par with a corrupt extremist like Tom DeLay.</em></p></blockquote>



<p>In short, skip the column and just read the letters. That's where the sharp stuff is. </p>

<p><strong><br />OFF-THE-MARK HALPERIN</strong></p>

<p>Mark Halperin, ABCâs political director, is often treated as some Buddha of political analysis, but â Gaaaaaa!&nbsp; âso often he offers up the most <u>un</u>-insightful takes, as on <em>Charlie Rose</em> (<a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=tvshow%3ACharlie_Rose&amp;so=1">8/9/06</a>) when he explained Liebermanâs loss with this golden nugget:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>The balance of power in the Democratic Party is shifting towards a group of people who want the party to be defined as anti-Bush, anti-Iraq war, and angry â and Joe Lieberman is none of these three things, and being the opposite of those three things contributed to costing him his seat.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>Angry? Democratic voters want their candidates to be angry? Gentle, sweet-faced Ned Lamont comes across as angry? Cynthia McKinney lost to Hank Johnson because Johnson was angry? </p>

<p>Talk about missing the mark! Now, it is true that many, many rank and file Democrats are frustrated to the point of anger at the political fecklessness of their party leaders over the last six years. But what they <u>want</u>&nbsp; is for the people representing them to stand up for principles... to be effective in slapping back the gargantuan Republican Spin Machine. They don't want anger; they want savvy. <br /> </p>

<p>The big complaint about Joe Lieberman is that he has repeatedly shown appalling judgmentâ¦and in ways that actually feed the worst in Republican Spin as inâ¦</p>

<ul><li>Self-righteously moralizing about Bill Clintonâs self-destructive dalliance without calling into account the Republicans who were hyping it to the detriment of much more important national business</li></ul>

<ul><li>Standing with the Republican spin that criticism of the president borders on consorting with the enemy</li></ul>

<ul><li>Refusing to acknowledge the astonishing failures of the Iraq invasion</li></ul>

<ul><li>Joining in the sick, right-wing base-pandering Terry Schiavo madness</li></ul>

<ul><li>Calling for bi-partisanship without making it clear that itâs primarily Republicans who&nbsp; have stabbed it to death. (And PS, Joe - You're the ranking Dem on the Government Affairs Committee but you haven't managed to muster even one hearing on the many millions of dollars lost &amp; wasted in Iraq. If you couldn't even swing this with Chair Susan Collins, spare us the big talk about your bipartisan powers.) </li></ul>

<ul><li>And so on. Continuing to this day with his reprehensible suggestion - fully aligned with the lowest of Republican talking points - that a vote for Ned Lamont is a vote for the terrorists! </li></ul>

<p>Is it too much to expect that the chief political director for a major broadcast network would be able to put together a more astute âunderstanding&quot; of what's going on.</p>

<p><strong><br />CHARLIE ROSE...AND THE QUESTION IS?</strong></p>

<p>Was it Morley Safer who did the piece on Charlie Rose some years ago and pointed out that when youâre watching Rose, you will almost inevitably find yourself yelling at the screen, âFor godâs sake, shut up, Charlie!â The guy does tend to blabber.&nbsp; But itâs even more maddening how often his questions seems to go on automatic pilot &amp; miss the most salient issue. </p>

<p>Just one sample: He interviewed&nbsp; Bobby Kennedy, Jr. on the event of Kennedyâs long article about <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen">election fraud</a> in Rolling Stone. After giving Kennedy all of four minutes to talk about election issues, Charlie changed the subject â âTell&nbsp; me what you think is the consequence of the Bush presidencyââ¦Two minutes after that, Charlie was on to âYes, but what about all those Democratic senators who voted to let Bush go to warâ and thatâs where he stayed for the remaining 14 minutes â But arenât the Democrats equally to blame for the war? And what effect will this have on who gets the nominated to run for president in 2008? And who should be the 2008 candidate? </p>

<p>And who the f___ cares, Charlie?! </p>

<p>Four minutes on the scary possibility â believed by millions of Americans â that we cannot trust our elections to reflect the actual vote. Is there a bigger deal in a democracy?&nbsp; Two minutes on the fact that this administration has managed to squander 230 years worth of international goodwill toward the US. And then fourteen minutes â 70% of the conversation â on blaming Democrats and guessing who might be nominated in 2008!&nbsp; Itâs worth watching the interview&nbsp; - <a href="http://video.google.com/videosearch?q=tvshow%3ACharlie_Rose&amp;page=2&amp;so=1&amp;lr=">7/6/06</a> - to catch&nbsp; the look of âwhaaaaat?â on Kennedyâs face, and to admire Kennedy for salvaging the interview all on his very own. But, as for Charlie -</p>

<p>No deeper questioning about vote issues for those who hadnât read <em>Rolling Stone</em>.<br />No âWell, I read your article but hereâs where I have problems believing there was fraudâ to draw out more information.<br />No âif there was fraudâ, what would have to happen to avoid it in the future?<br />No âwhatâs your next step on this?â <br />No âletâs talk more about the implications of Americaâs standing abroad.â<br />No âHow might you advise a future administration to correct the damage to our reputation? What would it take to fast track the repair?â</p>

<p>Instead,&nbsp; Charlie was all over Democratic culpability and 2008 odds-making. </p>

<p>Have major players always been this ill-adept, or is this particularly peculiar to these times of broad-based systemic breakdown? Just wondering.</p></div>
