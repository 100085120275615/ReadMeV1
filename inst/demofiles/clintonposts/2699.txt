<div><p>Earlier this week, Ira Forman spoke on an NJDC Blog conference call with several Jewish bloggers about <a href="http://jspot.org/?p=492">responses</a> to a <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-"><em>Washington Post</em></a> article discussing Orthodox Jewish voting trends.</p>

<p>The <em>Washington Post</em> claims that as the Orthodox community grows, the Jewish Republican vote will rise accordingly.</p>

<p>Mr. Forman indicates that Orthodox voters do tend to vote differently than voters in other factions of the Jewish community. Only 10-11% of the Jewish community identifies with Orthodoxy - the most interesting swing vote (not necessarily Republican vote) - in the Jewish community. The most religious, faithful Jews are more conservative than other Jews, but Republican voting is not as highly connected with religious observance as it is in other faith communities. </p>

<p>From analyzing exit poll data, we know that since 1972, the Republican Jewish vote has generally decreased, particularly with Clinton's election in 1992. The three-point rise in the last presidential election (Bush received 22% of the Jewish vote) still compares poorly to Republican presidential percentages from 1972-1988 - when the GOP always received between 30-40% of the Jewish vote. NJDC's non-profit, <a href="http://www.thesolomonproject.org">The Solomon Project</a> concluded: </p><blockquote><p>The Jewish vote has remained &quot;remarkably stable&quot; over the last three presidential elections, with American Jews voting 28 percent more Democratic than the national average in 1996, 30 percent more Democratic in 2000, and 29 percent more Democratic in 2004. </p></blockquote><p>Israel was the defining issue for Orthodox voters in 2004. According to Mr. Forman, in that election the small grouping of Orthodox voters that various polls sampled leads him to believe that they voted Republican by a 2-1 margin. He assumes Orthodox voters sided approximately 2-1 with the Democratic Party in 2000 - Senator Joe Lieberman was the first Jew on a major national ticket. However, we don't have hard data on the Orthodox vote in 2000 or earlier elections. </p>

<p>The focus on the Orthodox vote is important because it is the major swing vote in the Jewish bloc (along with young Jewish males) and is a growing population within the Jewish community.&nbsp; </p></div>
