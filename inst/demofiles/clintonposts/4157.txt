<p>Itâs time for us to move out of the temporary lab inside Scott Base where we&#8217;ve been working over the winter, to make our new home in our own <a href="http://www.heritage-antarctica.org/index.cfm/Newsletter/">conservation laboratories</a> outside the base.</p>
<p>Space inside Scott Base is at a premium in the summer months, so it had always been intended that during the summer we would be working from these conservation labs â two shipping containers that have been converted and equipped especially for us. These labs are self-sufficient and have solar panels and diesel generators for electricity and heating. They have been supported on skids so that they can be transported to the hut sites to enable conservation work to be conducted in the field.</p>

<p>For the winter, we had brought in materials and equipment from the laboratories and set up a <a href="http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/antarctica/?p=27">temporary laboratory</a> in the scientific event staging space in the <a href="http://www.antarcticanz.govt.nz/major-projects/3212">Hillary Field Centre</a> (HFC). The HFC was constructed in 2005 and connects to the rest of the base by link-way corridors. The centre houses all of the field gear and food for science events as well as food supplies for the base, which arrives by ship once a year.</p>
<p>It has been great to use the space and not have to venture outside every day!</p>
<p>From September, the HFC is needed for scientists and drillers setting up a project called <a href="http://www.andrill.org/">ANDRILL</a>. ANDRILL is a multinational project to improve understanding of Antarctica&#8217;s role in Cenozoic (65 million years ago to present) global change, through stratigraphic drilling of marginal sedimentary basins. We have begun the process of packing up and hope to be in the laboratory containers by the end of next week.</p>
<p>And thatâs almost it for me and Ainslie. The week after that is âWinflyâ, when those of us whoâve spent the winter in Antarctica get flown back home â and Ainslie and I will be heading back to Australia. Nicola is staying on until October!
