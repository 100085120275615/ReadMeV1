<br />NY POST EDITORIAL DEFENDS TASINI'S RIGHT TO DEBATE<br />
<br />NEW YORK, NY â Yesterday the New York Post editorialized about NY1âs refusal to let Jonathan Tasini in the Senate Primary debate. The editorial called for NY1 to allow Tasini in the debate and said that Clintonâs stand on Iraq âcould stand a little clarification,â and that âTasini has a point: 70 percent of New York Democrats consider Iraq to be a major Election Day issue, and, as he says, they can only benefit from a spirited debate on the issue.â The editorial is reproduced below in its entirety.<br />
<br />Newsday also published an editorial calling on NY1 to include Tasini last Wednesday, August 9th. âIt is shocking and disappointing that NY1 continues to insist on these barriers that limit political discourse,â said Tasini. âIt is no surprise that the public has lost faith in politics when they see this parody of democracy.âSenator Clinton has not responded to the letter sent by the Tasini campaign on August 2nd requesting a series of debates including one that focuses specifically on the Middle East. Nor has she agreed to participate in the September 6th debate hosted by the League of Women Voters. âWe are open to and would welcome any and all opportunities to discuss the issues with Senator Clinton,â said Tasini.<br />
<br />âWe also encourage other media outlets to schedule and hold other debates even if Senator Clinton refuses to participate.âFor more information visit: <a href="http://www.TasiniForNewYork.org">www.TasiniForNewYork.org</a>.<br />
<br />NY Post Editorial: Giving Hillary a PassAugust 15, 2006 -- Does the name Jonathan Tasini ring a bell? He's the anti-war Democrat looking to unseat Sen. Hillary Clinton in the September 12 primary.Tasini wants a prime-time debate with Clinton on cable TV channel NY1 - a self-appointed debate impresario - but the station is saying no.It seems that NY1 requires candidates to prove their viability by having raised or spent at least $500,000 (up from $50,000 last year) and by drawing more than 5 percent in the polls.Tasini's OK on the latter count: A Harris poll has him at 13 percent (Tom Suozzi had single-digit support prior to his NY1 bout with Attorney General Eliot Spitzer).Yet the cash-strapped, no-name Tasini is too broke to meet NY1's $500K requirement.<br />
<br />Now, let's be clear: NY1 has the right to impose and enforce the standards that it chooses. And voters certainly can appreciate the station wanting to limit its debates to viable candidates.But, upon entering the debate business, doesn't the station acquire certain obligations?<br />
<br />Traditionally, the test of seriousness in a statewide candidate in New York is successful completion of the grueling ballot-access process.It ain't easy, to put it mildly - but Tasini has made that grade.And if a viable candidacy is the gold standard, what in the world is NY1 doing allowing fringe Democrats Charlie King and Sean Patrick Maloney into its debate among candidates for attorney general this Thursday evening?<br />
<br />On the merits, Tasini has a point: 70 percent of New York Democrats consider Iraq to be a major Election Day issue, and, as he says, they can only benefit from a spirited debate on the issue.Obviously, Clinton is not going to lose the primary. But her stance on Iraq - always adaptable to changing circumstances - could stand a little clarification. Determining a candidate's "viability" is no easy feat, yet NY1 needs to cut Tasini a little slack.</div>
