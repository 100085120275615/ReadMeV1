<p>Excellent story.  I've certainly had similar experiences.  I hope it was all she thought is was gonna be.  Sometimes the anticipation is better than the actual act itself.  <br /><br />I really love the idea for this site.  Might I contribute?  I've written several short pieces and have nowhere to post them.  My current blog has some regulars who might be offended at some of my content.</p>

<p>You would be welcomed to contribute, Nonny, both in terms of writing new stories as well as adding to any of our existing pieces.<br /><br />Go to my profile, there is a link to email me. I will look for word form you and we can get started.<br /><br />I went to have a look at your blog. Depending on how soon you return I may have come and written a comment. Knoweing your regular audience, perhaps you can selectively make referrals to us...keeping non-blog friends in mind as well.<br /><br />As to your hoipe that things went as Hillary wished...you are free to write an installment to advance the story. How do you think that things would progress between Hillary and Logan?</p>
