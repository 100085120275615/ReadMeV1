I don't think any of you will be surprised by the answer to:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.beliefnet.org/section/quiz/index.asp?sectionID=10002&surveyID=83">What kind of Christian are you?</a></li><br /><br />Hillary Rodham Clinton Christian<br />(a.k.a. "Left-Leaning Traditionalist")<br />You think the Bible is divinely inspired, and you say Jesus was the Son of God (but secretly aren't so sure). You go to church when you can squeeze it in between soccer games, brunch, and "Meet the Press.â You admire Martin Luther King Jr., Dorothy Day, Bill Moyers, and the Dalai Lama; and have read Kathleen Norris' "Cloister Walk" and "Conversations With God." While watching "The Passion of the Christ," you cried during the flashback when toddler Jesus fell and Mary ran to him, but many other parts of the movie bothered you. You eat boneless chicken breasts, organic produce, and designer ice cream. You talk a lot about the value of community but can't quite remember the name of the guy two houses down. You ardently support gay rights even though you don't really want to think about what those people do. You believe the surrounding culture is polluted and blame it on big corporations. You give to charity but are more likely to help the Sierra Club than your church. The power of Christianity for you is the sense of community and the emphasis on love, forgiveness, and helping the less-fortunate.<br /><br />I beg to differ on some of this . . . .
