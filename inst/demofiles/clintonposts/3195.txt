<div>I really have a short term memory problem.  When I said that I usually ignore the mail because I don't get anything interesting, I completely forgot what I got on Tuesday!<br />
<br />

<br />It's <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/">Hillary</a>'s Wee Wonderful pattern book.  It's so cute!<br />
<br />

<br />Here's the back with the other two patterns included.<br />
<br />So what did I do yesterday afternoon?<br />

<br />Meet Clara!  (I named her after a character in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056183/">this movie</a>, or <a href="http://www.lct.org/calendar/event_detail.cfm?ID_event=34551107">musical</a>, if you prefer).  I went to Jo-ann's yesterday, got the only two felt colors that were halfway decent, and sewed her together in about 3 hours.  Her dress is made of some kimono fabric from my stash (I love my kimono fabric!).  I felt she was a little plain, so I added a crochet chain belt to finish her off.<br />

<br />I think her smile looks more like a smirk, don't you?<br />
<br />She's a little rough around the edges, I installed the arms in upside down, and I really need to practice my blanket stitch, but I love what Hillary has put in the first page of the booklet.<br />

<br />So I think that means that Clara has lots of character!  If you get a chance to get this booklet, I highly recommend it.</div>
