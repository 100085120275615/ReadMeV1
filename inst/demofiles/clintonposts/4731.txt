<p>Sebastian Mallaby <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082700553.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns">tries to warn</a> the Democrats that their war on Wal-Mart is a poltical loser. Happily, I doubt they&#8217;ll take his advice.</p>
<blockquote><p>Once upon a time, smart Democrats defended globalization, open trade and the companies that thrive within this system. They were wary of tethering themselves to an anti-trade labor movement that represents a dwindling fraction of the electorate. They understood the danger in bashing corporations: Voters don&#8217;t hate corporations, because many of them work for one.</p>
<p>Then dot-bombs and Enron punctured corporate America&#8217;s prestige, and Democrats bolted. Rather than hammer legitimately on real instances of corporate malfeasance &#8212; accounting scandals, out-of-control executive compensation and the like &#8212; Democrats swallowed the whole anti-corporate playbook.</p>
<p>To see the difference between then and now, just look at the Clintons. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Hillary Clinton sat on Wal-Mart&#8217;s board; and when Sam Walton died in 1992, Bill Clinton lauded him as &#8220;a wonderful family man and one of the greatest citizens in the history of the state of Arkansas.'&#8217; Campaigning in the New Hampshire primary that year, Bill Clinton came proudly to the rescue of a local company called American Brush Co. by helping it become a Wal-Mart supplier.</p>
<p>Times change. Last year Hillary Clinton returned a campaign contribution from Wal-Mart, even though she had no compunction in banking a check from Jerry Springer. The nation&#8217;s most successful retailer, which has seized the opportunities created by globalization to boost the buying power of ordinary Americans, is now seen as too toxic to touch. But a trash-talking TV host is acceptable.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The truth is that none of these Democrats can resist dumb economic populism. Even though we are not in a recession, and even though the presidential primaries are more than a year away, the DLC crowd is pandering shamelessly to the left of the party &#8212; perhaps in the knowledge that the grocery workers union, which launched the anti-Wal-Mart campaign, is strong in the key state of Iowa.</p>
<p>For a party that needs the votes of Wal-Mart&#8217;s customers, this is a questionable strategy. But there is more than politics at stake. According to a <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/W11809">paper</a> for the National Bureau of Economic Research by Jerry Hausman and Ephraim Leibtag, neither of whom received funding from Wal-Mart, big-box stores led by Wal-Mart reduce families&#8217; food bills by one-fourth. Because Wal-Mart&#8217;s price-cutting also has a big impact on the non-food stuff it peddles, it saves U.S. consumers upward of $200 billion a year, making it a larger booster of family welfare than the federal government&#8217;s $33 billion food-stamp program.</p>
<p>How can centrist Democrats respond to that? By beating up Wal-Mart and forcing it to focus on public relations rather than opening new stores, Democrats are harming the poor Americans they claim to speak for.</p></blockquote>
