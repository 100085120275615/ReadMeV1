<blockquote>ROGERS, Ark., July 15 â Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, returning to her red-state ties, chastised Democrats Saturday for taking on issues that arouse conservatives and turn out Republican voters rather than finding consensus on mainstream subjects.<br />
<br />Without mentioning specific subjects like gay marriage, Mrs. Clinton said: âWe do things that are controversial. We do things that try to inflame their base.â<br />
<br />âWe are wasting time,â the senator told a group of Democratic women here, on part of a two-day swing through a state that could provide an alternate hub to New York if she starts a national political campaign.</blockquote>Wow, there are so many things wrong here. What Hils seems to forget is that itâs the Right who keeps bringing up divisive crap like Constitutional amendments to turn us âmos into second-class citizens, and she forgets that they do this intentionally to bring out the knuckledragger vote. They manufacture a dire crisis â pick an issue: gay marriage, stem cell research, late-term abortions, Social Security, whatever â they screech like red-ass dung-flinging monkeys about it for a few months before an election, then they forget til the next time. Jeez, have you forgotten 2004 already?<br />
<br />If you think defending the Constitution and Bill of Rights and basic human dignity is controversial, Hils, then get the hell out of Congress and donât even think about running for President. Youâll get creamed and Iâll throw the first pie.</div>
