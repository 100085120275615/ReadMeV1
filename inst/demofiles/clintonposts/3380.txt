<div>Let the GOP <em>gotterdamrung</em> (pardon my awful German) commence!<br />
<br />Look for US Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas) to announce her candidacy for Governor on June 6th. She'll be taking on Governor Rick Perry in the GOP primary, and (if she wins) ex-Congressman Chris Bell in the general election, along with quirky independent Kinky Friedman. Of course, "if she wins" is going to be the sticking point regarding the primary. After all, when a popular US Senator challenges a party-popular only Governor, bloodletting with naturally follow. Especially when the Senator has been tarred by the Governor as the Texas version of Hillary Clinton, and the Governor has been tarred by the Senator as a incompetent bully. Perry and Hutchison simply don't like each other at all, and a primary will bring out the worst (best for us Dems) in both of 'em. The GOP is going to get hurt by the primary bigtime.<br />
<br />Not to mention the enjoyable game of musical chairs/hokey pokey that will ensue with Hutchison's decision. Will Lt. Governor David Dewhurst, AG Greg Abbott, Congressman Henry Bonilla, Congresswoman Kay Bailey Granger <strong>and </strong>multi-millionaire place-your-name-here (c'mon, every rich guy or gal in Texas is going to take a look at this race!) all run? And if so, who will run for their positions? And thus the domino effect totally transforms the Texas GOP. The more contentious primaries the better, I say.<br />
<br />Meanwhile, the Democrats have a much smaller candidate list-the obvious results of being whooped in the state since 1994. Currently, the Democratic frontrunners for Governor and Senator are ex-Congressman Chris Bell and attorney Barbara Ann Radnofsky, respectivelly. Both are strong candidates despite their lack of statewide name ID, and if the GOP gets weakened enough, both could win. I'm currently blogging for Barbara, so I'll keep this site updated with the latest Radnofsky reports when I can. For now, sit back and prepare to enjoy some MAJOR fireworks.<br />
