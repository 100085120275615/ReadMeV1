JSP called our attention to a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/16/nyregion/16conn.html?_r=1&th&emc=th&oref=slogin">New York Times story</a> that contained 
this gem:
<blockquote>
Former President Bill Clinton and Mrs. Clinton have offered to campaign for Mr. Lamont [and] his aides say the offer will be accepted....
</blockquote>
That will be fun to watch. Hillary and Bill just finished campaigning for the guy who will be running <b>against</b> Lamont. Presumably the question will be asked, Why 
the flip? The only possible answer, of course, will be "party solidarity" -- a response which ought to get quite a laugh, even in dour Connecticut. 
<p>
Then there's the awkward matter of... the, pardon the expression, issues. Lamont beat Joe by being anti-war. But the most prominent AIPAC-drone War Democrat in the Senate is going to be campaigning for him? How's that going to play? "I disagree with Ned and agree with Joe on the most important issue of the day, but I still think you should vote for Ned." 
<p>
Fudging the stark choices is, of course, a Clinton specialty, but this one will call for some real  virtuosity. If anybody can do it, though, the Clintons can. They're the Paganinis of Fudge.
