<p>The president is committed to win and to prevailÃ¢&#x20AC;Â¦what does that mean?  Is there a way of prevailing without winning or a way of winning without prevailing?  McCain is the guy we like of their people, so they will probably nominate Allen of VA.   Maybe obnoxious drunk is now a qualification for their nomination.<br />

Jennifer Ã¢&#x20AC;&#x201C; Evan Bayh is your guy </p>
<p>Hillary has a unique place in history as a former first lady and senator, and I trust her spending more than any Rpblcn.  She is too conservative for me, like Bayh, but we want to get hold of as many branches of government as we can, to end the strange agenda of reversal of values, to which we have become subjected under Bushco.  </p>
