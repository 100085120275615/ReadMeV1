<p>I can&#8217;t help it&#8230;Tucker Carlson does it for me. Man oh man what a hottie! Although how embarassing! I wonder what his lovely wife and their four children think of Tucker now? I mean good, WASPY Episcopalian bow-tie B- pundits from the right&#8230;just don&#8217;t dance! Or do they?</p>

&#8220;Daddy, please, for the love of Hillary (you know he wants her&#8230;) put your bow tie back <strong>on.</strong>&#8221;</p>
<p>Tucker reminds me of my schoolgirl crush on Andrew McCarthy back in the day,<br />
