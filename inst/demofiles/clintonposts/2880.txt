<div>Ah, the married life.<br />
<br />And within the married life are choices that have to be made.<br />
<br />I've been hearing all the glorious "Snakes on a Plane" reviews for our fraternity and can directly relate it to married life......<br />
<br />One of the more difficult petty choices we have in our house is movie rentals.  I'm a comedy/action kind of guy......but then again aren't all guys?  Wifey, on the other hand, is a love story/teenie bopper fan.  Both have their followings and both are usually mindless.  Just what everyone needs in a good movie.<br />
<br />Now when it comes to decision time, more often than not, I am guilted into having to rent the love story/teenie bopper thing.  Let me tell ya, too, that it is very difficult to walk up to the counter of Blockbuster holding the latest Hillary Duff movie bomb or a movie about long lost love starring Kevin Costner or J-Lo.  Talk about snickering.<br />
<br />So I have been combatting these horrid movies in creative ways in hopes that wifey will secede from her movie choices in favor of ones that I would like.<br />
<br />I have found 2 methods to doing this.<br />
<br />
<span>1.  Ask a lot of stupid questions throughout the movie.  You know, the ones that have obvious answers like "I bet she becomes the head chearleader, what do you think?" Or something like "man, she is ugly, but I bet the hot guy will find her inner beauty and they'll fall in love with each other."  Stupid comments like these have a tendency to piss off the siggy other and make them dread their movie selection</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>2.  Make inappropriate comments at the appropriate times.  This one is a hard one to master.  Let's say there is a climax in a love story when the main characters finally make that first kiss or put their differences aside because they have discovered that they are truly in love.  This is the perfect time to throw in some lines like "I bet she likes it in the ass...." or "Think they'll show her going down on him?" or "I bet that because she is the head cheerleader now, she'll get a lot of action and stuff." These kinds of comments are called mood-killers.  They are part of the master plan to destroy any appreciation for these horrid movies.</span>
<br />
<br />So good luck with movie night for all you fine folks that are faced with these dillemmas.  I cannot guarantee that it will work 100%, but at least you'll see that your movie selections are chosen more often.......and that's the goal anyway, isn't it?<br />
<br />
<br />How the hell do I stay married?</div>
