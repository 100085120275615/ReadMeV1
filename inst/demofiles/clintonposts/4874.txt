<p>Well, since I&#8217;ve been debating all day at work and seem to be the source of all this, I guess I should answer &#8220;<a href="http://lordben.blogspot.com/2006/08/lord-ben-challenge-in-response-to-post.html">The Lord Ben Challenge</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>For those unaware, Lord Ben was a hardcore Walker backer who can&#8217;t seem to get over Scott&#8217;s withdrawal from the race. Hell, I saw him just last week weeping into his &#8220;Walker for Governor&#8221; T-Shirt in his driveway. Told him to &#8220;Man Up&#8221; and he ran after me with a pitchfork. (I write this is jest, he&#8217;s voting for Green, just not volunteering his time even though he did in 2004.  A lot more than I did, come to think of it.)</p>
<p>Here are his rules.</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Make a post on your blog.<br />
2. Entitle it &#8220;Why Green is Awesome&#8221;.<br />
3. Write a post on why Green is awesome, don&#8217;t mention Doyle even ONCE! The focus is on Green, not Green compared to someone else.<br />
4. Don&#8217;t make it sound like a press release; make it sound like a blog entry. It can be nerdy and wonky, but it should still read like a blog and be full of personal opinions, not campaign website information.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well here goes.</p>
<p>1) Mark Green is awesome because he would have told his followers to do the right thing and get over his withdrawal from the race instead of bringing it up two weeks prior to the primary so guys like Xoff, the OneWisconsinNow crew, and rest of the Electronic Left in WI can think the GOP Base is still split.</p>
<p>2) Mark Green is awesome for getting <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2006/07/435_districts_435_blogs_agains.php">a perfect 100% from the Club for Growth</a> on Rep. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) on 19 Amendments to eliminate pork from a spending bill.</p>
<p>3) Mark Green is awesome for being a family man first.  At last year&#8217;s Manitowoc Co. Fair, when he found out he was going to have some extra time, he turned to his son Alex and said, &#8220;Hey buddy, looks like we may have time for some rides.&#8221;</p>
<p>4) Mark Green is awesome for kicking ass and taking names in Congress against Child Predators <a href="http://www.dailyutahchronicle.com/media/storage/paper244/news/2002/03/15/WorldReport/two-Strikes.Bill.Passed.In.House-217665.shtml?norewrite200608251422&#038;sourcedomain=www.dailyutahchronicle.com">since 1999</a>.  He&#8217;s the author of the &#8220;Two Strikes and You&#8217;re Out Laws&#8221; on child murders, child molesters, and others who prey on kids.</p>
<p>5) Mark Green is awesome for <a href="http://www.house.gov/ryan/press_releases/2002pressreleases/dairy12802.html">trying to help</a> Wisconsin Dairy Farmers by ending the New Deal Era Milk Marketing Orders.  These orders, around since 1937, are <em>the</em> reason Wisconsin is losing its once proud place of prominence in the American Dairy Market.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t get it done, but you try against 53 Congressman and 2 Senators from California.</p>
<p>6) Mark Green is awesome for running such an effect campaign in 1998 &#8212; also not a GOP year because of public disagreement of the pending Impeachment of Clinton (Dems gain +5 seats) &#8212; he beat a well-known incumbent in former Green Bay anchorman Jay Johnson to go to Congress. He became the only GOP candidate to beat an incumbent Democrat that election cycle.</p>
<p>7) Mark Green is awesome for having the most Conservative rankings of the Wisconsin Delegation in 2005. (<a href="http://lakeshorelaments.com/2006/02/25/2005-national-journal-congressional-vote-rankings/">National Journal</a>) </p>
<p>8) Mark Green is awesome for being chosen to attend the funeral of Pope John Paul II.</p>
<p>9) Mark Green is awesome for calling it &#8220;Planet Madison&#8221; before <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTI0MGIyNzliMmNmMDRmMmQ5Njk1ZTcxNmQyMjE3YTQ=">UW Alums who write for National Review</a> called it that.</p>
<p>10) Mark Green is awesome for having <a href="http://www.acuratings.org/2005all.htm#WI">a lifetime ranking</a> with the American Conservative Union of 88. The same number of the guy people want his primary opponent to someday replace in Congress.</p>
<p>11) Finally, Mark Green is awesome for being a good man.  </p>
<p>I can tout all the talking points that will make a right-leaning politico blush, but for me it&#8217;s the fact the last time I talked with Mark (Brat Days Parade) we talked about the campaign, policy, and the new web-mercial they just released.  Then out of the blue, he asked how my dad was doing.</p>
<p>Never expected it, never even figured he&#8217;d know being as busy a guy as he is, and it made me appreciate &#8220;Mark Green, the human being&#8221; a hell of a lot more.
