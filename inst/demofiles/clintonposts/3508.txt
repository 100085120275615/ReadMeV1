<div>Scott Lemieux <a href="http://thedailyjosh.blogspot.com">argues</a> that Nader wanted Bush to get elected, in order to strengthen the progressive elements of the left as a whole.<blockquote>Moreover, his actions in the last month were actually consistent with the goal of electing Bush to punish the Democrats and heighten the contradictions, whereas they are radically inconsistent with the idea that his goal was to get matching funds for a party he quite evidently didn't give a rat's ass about.  The states for him to mine votes in the last month were where Gore was a lock, not highly contested swing states. <br />
<br />
<b>Electing Bush was not a random byproduct of the 2000 Nader campaign; it was its raison d'etre.</b> I can sort of understand people not getting this in 2000, particularly before the last weeks of the campaign, but at this late date? Give it up. He announced he wanted to elect Bush, he campaigned in a manner entirely consistent with that goal, and he succeeded. There's no second verse here.  (emphasis mine)</blockquote>His basis for this argument comes from a June 2000 article in <a href="http://outside.away.com/magazine/200008/200008camp_nader1.html">Outside Online</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When asked if someone put a gun to his head and told him to vote for either Gore or Bush, which he would choose, <b>Nader answered without hesitation: "Bush."</b> Not that he actually thinks the man he calls "Bush Inc." deserves to be elected: "He'll do whatever industry wants done." The rumpled crusader clearly prefers to sink his righteous teeth into Al Gore, however: "He's totally betrayed his 1992 book," Nader says. "It's all rhetoric." Gore "groveled openly" to automakers, charges Nader, who concludes with the sotto voce realpolitik of a ward heeler: <b>"If you want the parties to diverge from one another, have Bush win."</b> (emphasis mine)</blockquote>
<br />Ezra Klein follows up with the <a href="http://thedailyjosh.blogspot.com">argument</a> that, if this was indeed Nader's goal, he succeeded.<blockquote>The Democratic Party really has diverged from the Republican Party. Its progressive and liberal strains have amassed vast amounts of influence and organizing capabilities. The most ostentatiously, unnecessarily conservative of its members are being seriously primary'd, an effort that, whether or not it succeeds, will worry all incumbents who would break faith with the left. The party is vibrating with new health care bills, national security strategies, economic philosophies, and progressive worldviews -- most all of which explicitly or implicitly reject the rightward drift of the 90's. And Gore, the man Nader helped beat, may well be the phenomenon's most compelling example: Where in 2000 he ran a mealy-mouthed, uninspiring campaign with few big ideas and even fewer moments of real liberalism, he's become an electric voice for progressivism and conscience, emerging a hero to lefties everywhere. <br />
<br />The damage Bush has caused is incalculable, the death toll staggering. But insofar as Nader believed his victory would reawaken the left's progressivism, he appears to have been dead on.</blockquote>
<br />As for the issue of Nader's intentions, I am unsure what to think.  The most likely explanation for his candidacy that I can come up with is that he wanted to secure 5% of the vote to get his party on the ballot.  I would truly like to believe that pushing the democratic party to the left as a result of a Bush victory was a secondary motivation for Ralph.<br />
<br />I also have to disagree with Ezra's analysis of the Democratic party's move toward progressivism.  While there is some of that going on, the fact that some of the party's most influential members include Hillary and Lieberman makes me question how far the party has come in the last 6 years.  In addition to this, I don't see any compelling evidence that the limited progressive shift that has occurred within the party was directly caused by the fact that Bush was elected.  If anything, the shameless use of the 9/11 crisis by the Bush administration caused some Democrats in Congress to react to the situation in a hawkish manner, which is anything but progressive.<br />
<br />Regardless, I find this discussion to be interesting and I feel that it has potentially serious implications for the role of third parties in American politics.  Kudos to <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/">Scott</a> and <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/">Ezra</a> for their thoughtful words on the subject.</div>
