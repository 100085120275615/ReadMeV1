<div>Signaling that the New York State GOP has no intention of letting democratic principles creep into their organization, we are being told that the <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/318284p-272162c.html">party's candidates for Governor, US Senate, Comptroller and Attorney General in 2006 are in the process of being "picked" for the Republican rank and file, ignorant dolts that we are</a>.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>State Republican leaders have come up with a dream ticket for next year's critical election - featuring a matchup between Westchester District Attorney Jeanine Pirro and Sen. Hillary Clinton. <br />
<br />The GOP wish list also includes former Rep. Rick Lazio as its candidate for state attorney general and former Assembly Minority Leader John Faso for state controller, several state Republican Party sources told the Daily News.</blockquote>
<br />These are the same strategic thinkers who gave us the <a href="http://www.elections.state.ny.us/elections/2002/general/2002_ag.pdf">2002, recording-setting Spitzer-Izarry Attorney General debacle</a>, wherein Republican Dora Izarry set a statewide election record, garnering only 32% of the vote. Despite the magnitude of such a feat, the state party would only outdo itself two years later when <a href="http://seandoherty.blogspot.com/2005/03/kinda-sad-really.html">Howard Mills received LESS THAN 25% OF THE POPULAR against Chuck Schumer for US Senate</a>.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Asked about the candidate slotting, state GOP Chairman Steve Minarik told The News, "There is no question that Jeanine Pirro and Rick Lazio are two names that energize our base very well."</blockquote>
<br />
<br />What base are you talking about, Chairman Minarik? The one that you alienate more and more each year by continually removing them from the candidate selection process.<br />
<br />This has to stop. Now. Time for us to take the party back, by force if necessary. Otherwise, Eliot Spitzer gets elected, businesses flee the state, and New York falls onto the ash-heap of history.<br />--------------<br />Also covered at:<br />
