Schweitzer (D-MT) lands âPlummâ role on big screen</a> The article has all of Schweitzer's lines. <br /><blockquote>Gov. Brian Schweitzer will have a bit part in the reality-inspired Hollywood movie now being filmed in Livingston and Bozeman: Heâll play an exasperated sheriff who swears at a pregnant woman.<br /><br />Schweitzer will say just 27 words in his small role as Sheriff Strunk in the movie âA Plumm Summer.â The film, inspired by real events in Billings in the 1960s, is about a popular local childrenâs television puppet that is kidnapped.<br /><br />Schweitzer plays a sheriff who addresses a crowd of distressed mothers. He is heading to Livingston early Friday morning to film his scene.<br /><br />âI may have let it slip that I would do anything to get them to do that film here,â Schweitzer said playfully in an interview Wednesday. âAnything up to and including playing a role in the movie myself.â<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The film, which started filming in early July, stars William Baldwin, Henry Winkler and Lisa Guerrero.</blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/UndertheDome/081606.html">Your Senators and Their Names</a><br /><blockquote>Sen. George Allen (R-Va.) is taking hits for something he canât control: his middle name. Allenâs Democratic challenger this year set about to referring to Allen sneeringly in press releases as âGeorge Felix Allen Jr.,â a ploy to draw attention to the senatorâs quirky middle name, one more readily associated with the animated âFelix the Catâ or the Odd Coupleâs Felix Unger than with great statesmen.<br /><br />Allen isnât the only lawmaker stuck with a clunky moniker. Former Rep. W.J. âBillyâ Tauzin never used his given name, the nerdy Wilbert. Sens. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) both dropped the hoary Clarence in favor of their middle names. Sen. Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) eschewed alliteration when he dropped his first name, Alan. And Sen. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) had to put a macron over the âaâ in his surname to remind people that it rhymes with Sabo.<br /><br />But perhaps the most unfortunate given name in politics is Sen. Kent Conradâs (D-N.D.) first name, the singular Gaylord. Yes, the French appellation that was mercilessly ridiculed in the 2000 hit comedy âMeet the Parentsâ in which Ben Stiller plays hapless male nurse Gaylord Focker. Conrad never uses it. Even his financial disclosure forms list merely âG. Kent Conrad.â<br /><br />When Conrad was born in 1948, the name was nearing the end of four decades of popularity, ranking 566th among male baby names in the 1940s, just two slots ahead of one of the few choices that would have been worse: Adolph.</blockquote><br /><br />Cracked magazine is back, and <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/magazines/michael_ian_black_named_editoratlarge_as_cracked_returns_from_2year_hiatus_42086.asp">Daily Show folks are involved with it</a> (BTW, love the photo shopped Tom Cruise/40-year-old virgin cover).<br /><br />Speaking of 40-year-old virgins, Tucker Carlson's in training for ABC's Dancing With the Stars. <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/television/team_tucker_carlson_goes_public_42041.asp">He talks to ex-reality show contestant Kim Caldwell</a> about it all. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/msnbc/dance_dance_dance_42057.asp">Joe Scarborough hams it up; does dance skit</a> in "honor" of Tucker Carlson, I suppose. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlDC/hottest_media_types/further_proof_that_journalists_are_hot_42036.asp">Marie Claire fashion pics of various media types</a> including Fareed Zakaria, Norah O'Donnell, Claire Shipman, Chris & Kathleen Matthews, George Stephanopolous.<br /><br />Speaking of <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14153965/">fashion...</a><br /><blockquote>Paris Hilton and Tipper Gore donât have much in common - but they do carry the same handbag. âItâs a fashionable, eco friendly purse made of old billboards and recycled Luna bar wrappers, available from Ecoist.com,â said a source. âTipper carries one because of her interest in the environment and Paris carries one because of her interest in looking hot.â</blockquote><br /><br />Congrats to Rep.

Jack Reed (D-R.I.), a West Point graduate and member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is among the lawmakers who travel most frequently to Iraq and Afghanistan. But Reed may have to cut down the amount of time he spends in combat zones because he is expecting to soon become a new father.<br /><br />Reedâs wife Julia, 40, whom he married in April of last year, is due to deliver the coupleâs first child in December.<br /><br />âAs my family responsibility increases, it might be a factor,â said Reed of taking fewer future trips to global hot spots.<br /><br />His wife may have more of a direct say in the matter than most other Senate spouses. Thatâs because she is an Interparliamentary Coordinator in the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, the agency that handles the Senateâs international travel and contact with foreign governments.<br /><br />But Reed said his wife knew what she was getting into when they married. After all, they first met on a trip to Afghanistan in 2002.<br /><br />âI think she understood Iâd being doing some of that stuff,â said Reed.<br /><br />âSo far itâs going well,â Reed said of juggling his new family duties with his Senate responsibilities. âSheâs been extremely understanding.â<br /><br />If Reed, who turns 57 in November, needs any advice on becoming a father later in life, he might turn to Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.), who became a first time father at the same age in 2001.</blockquote><br /><br /><a href="http://www.nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section_id=9&screen=news&news_id=51576">Gov.
