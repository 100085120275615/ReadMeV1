<p><img class="photo" height="389" alt="Chris Edwards - For Oregon!" src="http://www.rattledbaby.com/images/chris_edwards.jpg" width="258" align="right" border="0" />Apparently I have a category on my blog for &ldquo;political&rdquo;. A while back &ndash; several years &ndash; I used to be pretty involved with politics and stayed in tune with what was going on. At some point I decided that I was wasting a little too much energy worrying about things that I probably couldn&rsquo;t change that much. I used to think that it would be cool to be a politician, now I just want to be rich enough to own a couple of them. <img src="http://www.rattledbaby.com/images/smile1.gif" /></p>
<p align="left">But there is something that I can support politically &ndash; and that is <a href="http://www.chrisedwardsfororegon.com/">Chris Edwards</a>&nbsp;running for the Oregon House. Chris is the husband of famous scrapbooker <a href="http://aliedwards.typepad.com/">Ali Edwards</a>&nbsp;&ndash; that&rsquo;s him on the right, with their son Simon. Now, you might dispute Ali&rsquo;s scrapbooking fame, but let me point out that googling (yes, &ldquo;<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=google&amp;x=0&amp;y=0">googling</a>&rdquo; is a word!) for &ldquo;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;c2coff=1&amp;q=chris+edwards+for+oregon&amp;btnG=Search">Chris Edwards for Oregon</a>&rdquo; in an attempt to find his website, brings up <a href="http://aliedwards.typepad.com/">Ali&rsquo;s blog</a> first. As Ali would say&hellip;&ldquo;Dude.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">So, in an effort to assist Chris represent what <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmHm0rGns4I">some refer to as</a>&nbsp;Washington&rsquo;s Mexico &hellip; or California&rsquo;s Canada &hellip; you can <a href="http://www.earlblumenauer.com/cgi-bin/housedems.cgi">click here to go to Earl Blumenauer&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;website. Earl is a US representative for the state of Oregon and is helping to support candidates based on an internet vote. One cannot ignore the impact of <a href="http://aliedwards.typepad.com/">Ali&rsquo;s blog</a> helping to catapult Chris into the semi-finals (If only Oregon allowed internet <strong>voting!</strong>) However, we need everyone to help Chris win the semis &mdash; so go vote on the website yourself &mdash; and tell your family and friends. You know the Democrat mantra: Vote early and vote often! (Just kidding Chris&hellip; <em>kinda</em>)</p>
<p align="left">Yes &ndash; Chris is a <strong>Democrat </strong>&hellip; But, hey, it&rsquo;s Oregon, the state that <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mPXUuxXwQw">legalized marijuana</a>&nbsp;&ndash; do you really expect anyone to run as a Republican? Now, I haven&rsquo;t asked Chris where he stands on <strong>every</strong> issue &ndash; nor if he is afflicted with glaucoma &ndash; but we have discussed politics a bit and I&rsquo;d say we&rsquo;re not that far apart. Chris remarked to me at one point during a political conversation, &ldquo;Funny &ndash; you sound like a Democrat&rdquo; &mdash; all the while I was thinking, &ldquo;He really sounds like a Republican&rdquo; <img src="http://www.rattledbaby.com/images/smile1.gif" /></p>
<p align="left">I guess I am becoming more open-minded&hellip; Most of my conversations centered around politics used to go something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">&ldquo;You would vote for Hillary for president?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Sure&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an idiot!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">And that would be the end of that&hellip; No discourse &ndash; just an impassioned remark regarding the other person&rsquo;s intellect.</p>
<p align="left">Now I find myself entertaining other people&rsquo;s ideas more and trying to figure out <strong><em>why </em></strong>they think the way they do:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="left">&ldquo;You would vote for Hillary for president?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Sure&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Really? That&rsquo;s interesting&hellip; Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Well, I think that it would be good for the country to have a woman president and I agree with her on a lot of issues.&rdquo;</p>
<p align="left">&ldquo;Oh&hellip; Really? You&rsquo;re an idiot!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p align="left">At least then I know <strong><em>why </em></strong>they are an idiot &mdash; call it my version of self-enlightenment <img src="http://www.rattledbaby.com/images/smile1.gif" /></p>
<p align="left">Anyway, go&nbsp;<a href="http://www.earlblumenauer.com/cgi-bin/housedems.cgi">vote for Chris</a>, even if you are a staunch Republican / conservative, because&hellip;</p>
