<div>Fred Barnes of the Weekly Standard is talking up the idea that <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/295zkwpw.asp">Cheney could run for president</a>. Yes, I know Cheney has specifically stated that he wouldnât consider it.  One of the reasons he hasnât run before is because he couldnât raise the needed money and one of the reasons for inability to fundraise is that he was too much of an insider and has aâhow you sayâsomewhat colorless personality. <br />
<br />Things are different now.  Everybody is now familiar with Cheney and I think that the GOP fund-raising apparatus would line up behind him if he decided to run. <br />
<br />While my intellectual preference for the GOP presidential candidate in 2008 is Cheney my emotional preference is for Condi Rice.  Hillary is likely to be the Democratic nominee in 2008 and I would just love to see Condi dismembering Hillary in the debates. <br />
<br />That being said, I think that it may be best for Condi to have four to eight years experience as VP before she advances to president.  Of course, there are an untold number of circumstances that may derail her chances of making it to the presidency as of now her odds are as good as anyoneâs. <br />
<br />In fact, I think Iâd just as happy with either a Cheney- Rice ticket as a Rice-Cheney ticket.</div>
