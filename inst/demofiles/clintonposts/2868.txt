<div>According to Media Matters, a New York Times online article on Hillary Clinton by Anne E. Kornblut not only gave a false impression, it implied the <i>opposite</i> of what she said.<br />
<br />Kornblut:<blockquote>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, returning to her red-state ties, chastised Democrats Saturday for taking on issues that arouse conservatives and turn out Republican voters rather than finding consensus on mainstream subjects.<br />
<br />Without mentioning specific subjects like gay marriage, Mrs. Clinton said: âWe do things that are controversial. We do things that try to inflame their base.â<br />
<br />âWe are wasting time,â the senator told a group of Democratic women here, on part of a two-day swing through a state that could provide an alternate hub to New York if she starts a national political campaign.</blockquote>
<br />
<br />But those quotes are taken out of context from Hillary's speech. To give context, here's more of her speech:<blockquote>And so we were talking one day and saying, you know, we as individuals, we have all of this legislation, we can't get it on the floor of the Senate. <span>We can't get a vote on it because the Republican majority wants to vote on other things.</span> So we pulled all our best ideas together. Wouldn't this be a good agenda for America: safeguard America's pensions; good jobs for Americans; make college affordable for all; protect America and our military families; prepare for future disasters; make America energy independent; make small business and healthcare affordable, invest in life saving science; and protect our air, land, and water. You know, Blanche Lincoln has a bill to make healthcare affordable for small business, I have a bill I was talking to you about with respect to energy independence, we have legislation sitting in the Senate to address these problems. <span>But with the Republican majority, that's not their priority. So we do other things, we do things that are controversial, we do things that try to inflame their base so that they can turn people out and vote for their candidates.</span> I think we are wasting time, we are wasting lives, we need to get back to making America work again, in a bipartisan, nonpartisan way."</blockquote>Hillary is clearly chastising the <i>Republicans</i> for preventing the Senate from accomplishing anything, not her fellow Democrats.<br />
<br />This is so weird. Did Kornbluth listen to the speech, or just spin out a story from a collection of quotes supplied by someone else?</div>
