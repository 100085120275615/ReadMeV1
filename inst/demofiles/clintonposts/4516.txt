<p>I am delighted to announce that <a href="http://www.law.capital.edu/Faculty/Bios/bsmith.asp">Bradley A. Smith</a>, law professor at Capital University and former Chairman of the FEC, has joined the <a href="http://www.washingtonsx.com/advisory_board.html">WSX Advisory Board</a>.  Bradley is one of the nation&#8217;s leading authorities on Election Law and Campaign Finance.  In 2000 he was nominated by President Clinton to fill a Republican-designated seat on the Federal Election Commission, where he served for five years, including serving as Chairman of the Commission in 2004.  In August of 2005 he returned to his position as Professor of Law at Capital University Law School, and is also &#8220;Of Counsel&#8221; with the Columbus, Ohio and Washington D.C. offices of the law firm of Vorys, Sater, Seymour and Pease.</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.reason.com/0512/fe.bs.john.shtml">From Reason Online, December 2005:</a></p>
	<blockquote><p>During Bradley A. Smithâs legendarily testy 2000 confirmation hearing for a slot on the Federal Election Commission (FEC), senators piled on the insults like pork for home-state contractors. None were more effusive in their outrage than the Glimmer Twins of campaign finance reform, Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), whose eponymous legislation, also known as the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, has helped usher in a repressive age of limits on explicitly political speech.</p>
	<p>Putting Smith, a Harvard-trained lawyer who was then 42 years old, on the commission responsible for making sure campaigns followed the law would be &#8220;akin to confirming a conscientious objector to be secretary of defense,&#8221; thundered McCain. &#8220;Smith on the FEC would really be a case of the fox guarding the hen house,&#8221; chimed in Feingold. Al Gore, who as vice president ruled over the Senate, sniffed that Smith was &#8220;unfit for office&#8221; despite an enviable record of scholarly publications.  Yet Smith, whose nomination was strongly supported by Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), not only passed senatorial muster but went on to serve as chairman of the FEC before resigning his post this year. </p></blockquote>
	<p>A friend of free markets and free speech, Smith also became well-known in the blogosphere last March when he <a href="http://news.com.com/The+coming+crackdown+on+blogging/2008-1028_3-5597079.html">warned</a> that the federal government may soon crack down on blogs if they improperly link to a candidate&#8217;s web site or engage in certain kinds on campaigning.  </p>
	<p>As a side note, Bradley Smith recently founded the Center for Competitive Politics.  The Center for Competitive Politics is a non-profit organization founded in August 2005 by Smith and Stephen M. Hoersting, a campaign finance attorney and former General Counsel to the National Republican Senatorial Committee. CCPâs mission, through legal briefs, studies, historical and constitutional analyses, and media communication, is to educate the public on the actual effects of money in politics, and the results of a more free and competitive electoral process. With the exception of participating in the two pending Supreme Court cases relevant to its mission, CCP will open its doors in early 2006.</p>
	<p>We&#8217;re thrilled to be able to call on Bradley for his advice and guidance as the Washington Stock Exchange moves forward.  Please refer to the <a href="http://www.washingtonsx.com/advisory_board.html">Advisory Board</a> page for additional biographical information.
