I love this song.<br /><br /><br /><br />Hope you all like the picture too. I spent the better part of an hour trying to find just the right one to go with the song.<br /><br />I've had a relaxing weekend. Spent time with friends and family and generally tried to wind down from the stresses that seem to besiege the rest of my time.<br /><br />Friday I had a wander out with Hal. We grabbed coffee in town and had the catch up that we had both been trying to find time for since getting back from Berlin. He is so settled with his girlfriend now that's it's scary! They are buying a house together and discussing decorating styles. I spent friday evening at my aunts house, eating chinese food and watched Will Smith do his thing in Bad Boys 2. My aunt has a 50" flat widescreen tv that was almost like having Will Smith in the room with us (drool) I did end up agreeing to babysit my cousin all day on Saturday though. Long time readers will recall my ambivalence towards children. my cousin is 12 years old and very, very quiet.<br />Fortunately, she seemed satisfied to feed my cats so many treats that their stomachs appeared to visibly expand, and watch her favourite Hillary Duff movie 'A Cinderella Story'<br />Six hours in her compant though was exhausting and it was a relief to spend the remainder of the evening lying on the sofa eating Haagen Daaz and watching 'You've Got Mail'<br />You can't beat a good old chick flick for relaxation.<br /><br />This week I have to try and follow up on some employment leads. With a little luck I should have some final interviews lined up soon. I also have to meet with one of the senior manager from work to discuss filing an official grievance against my bitch of a manager. I am dreading that meeting. Just the thought of it makes me feel sick.<br />Hopefully though, I wont have to go back to work until I can hand in my notice.<br /><br />Meantime, enjoy the track, and Happy Musical Monday to all.
