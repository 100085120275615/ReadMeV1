<em>Barack Obama, the rising star of the Democratic party, is still rising.  I remember when I was working in the campaign of Obama's senatorial opponent, the word was that Obama's political ambitions included being on the national ticket in 2008, either in the top spot or as second banana to Hilary Clinton.  He certainly seems to be auditioning for the national stage.</em>

<strong>Senator's Kenya Visit Inspires Obama-Mania</strong>
</a>
<br />
<br /> "Obama-mania is sweeping the nation, particularly the long-marginalized west, which is preparing a hero's homecoming for the half-Kansan, half-Kenyan senator, who began a 15-day, five-nation African tour over the weekend.<br />
<br />Construction workers are racing to complete the new science lab at the recently rededicated Senator Obama Secondary School. A play based on his best-selling autobiography recently took the stage at Kenya's National Theater. Sales of long-popular Senator beer, which locals dubbed 'Obama' after his election, have doubled since June, brewery officials said.<br />
<br />Obama's parents met and married in Hawaii, where he was born. When he was a toddler, his parents separated, and he only saw his father once afterward. The senator hasn't visited Kenya in 14 years. His support for abortion and gay rights would roil most voters here. But none of that matters to locals, who see Obama, 45, as their new favorite son."</div>
