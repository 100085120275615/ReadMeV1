<div>So I'm still rooting for LÃ³pez Obrador to pull ahead in the Mexican presidential race (although it seems increasingly unlikely that he'll actually do so), for all of the usual, boringly obvious Massachusetts-lefty-transplanted-to-the-Bay-Area reasons. (1) The most important reason to back LÃ³pez Obrador, though, is the shocking revelation made Sunday night concerning the true nature of his PAN opponent, Felipe CalderÃ³n. During Azteca America's coverage of CalderÃ³n's victory-according-to-selected-indicators speech, the wide-angle camera shots revealed that not one but <em>two</em> of the people standing directly in front of the main podium were wearing NY Yankees caps (tan and blue respectively, turned backwards so that the logos were clearly visible). Seriously, PAN, your candidate studied at Harvard and you <em>still</em> can't muster up any love for the BoSox? (2) For shame. That's the final straw - you're dead to me, PAN. LÃ³pez Obrador para siempre! (3)<br />
<br />
<br />(1) No, he's not perfect. The cartoon pamphlet that he distributed in 2004 claiming that "dark forces" were working against him was so over the top in its paranoia and sense of self-righteous aggrievement that when I first saw it I thought that it was that it was a piece of cutting satire produced by his opponents. (Then again, the various attempts to disqualify LÃ³pez Obrador from even entering the presidential race certainly lend some plausibility to notions of "fuerzas oscuras.") And the PRD's post-election rumblings and threats to disregard election results have been a bit disquieting (although once more, it's not as if there aren't <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuauhtemoc_Cardenas">reasons</a> for PRD supporters to be suspicious of the validity of presidential vote counts). On the whole, though, I think LÃ³pez Obrador has gotten a raw deal from the U.S. press, which seems obsessed with fitting news from Latin America into a "resurgence of the populist-authoritarian left" storyline and which generally insists on using the unit of one standard ChÃ¡vez to measure the region's leaders (according to some quick back-of-the envelope calculations, Fidel Castro tips the scales at a hefty 2.5 ChÃ¡vezes, Evo Morales and Lula da Silva both come in at a respectable 0.7 ChÃ¡vezes apiece and Alan GarcÃ­a barely registers at only a tenth of a ChÃ¡vez. To be fair, the LÃ³pez Obrador-ChÃ¡vez comparison is not the sole creation of U.S. reporters, as the PAN also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/27/AR2006062701702.html">ran campaign ads linking the two.</a>)While it can be useful to look at events within a regional context, individual and national differences are often as important as the similarities. Expressing concern for the poor does not automatically make a politician a ruthless demagogue, and advocating that wealthy citizens contribute more to their country is not one step away from dressing everyone in burlap and sending them off to collective farms. There are arguments to be made about LÃ³pez Obrador's merits as a politician, but painting him as a ChÃ¡vez-in-waiting seems to miss the point.<br />
<br />2) Yeah, yeah, the men in the Yankees caps were probably photographers or reporters, and not actually affiliated with the PAN. Still, does a decent presidential candidate allow the Yankees to be supported in his or her presence? That's right, I didn't think so. (Yeah, Hillary. <a href="http://www.votehillary.org/gpx/AIMYankees.gif">You heard me.</a>)<br />
<br />(3) No, growing up in Massachusetts didn't bias me on this issue at all - why do you ask?</div>
