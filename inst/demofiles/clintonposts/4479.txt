<p>Fuck You Bush, for playing Corky to Dick Cheneyâs evil twin of Willford Brimley.Â  I could go on about how you didnât give a shit while being told that Hurricane Katrina would Devastate the Gulf Coast Region.Â  You think maybe youâd have a question.Â  But no, your only statement was, âWe are well prepared.âÂ  Even as Michael Brown (who is looking less like a FU Award winner these days, even though I still say Fuck You Brownie) was telling you that you werenât prepared.Â  So Fuck You Bush.Â  You are the most criminally negligent leader since Nero.</p>
<p>And Condelleza Rice has nothing better to do than release a video of her exercise routine.Â  When do we get Cheneyâs video?Â  Fuck You Condelleza, although we are all probably better off when you arenât working.</p>
<p>OK, Iâm glad I got that over with.Â  I really wanted this Fuck you award to be different.Â  I was planning on only giving Fuck Yous to Democrats, but Bush always does something to Fuck with my best plans.</p>
<p>So Fuck You Ruth Bader Ginsberg.Â  There is a reason that the job ofÂ  Supreme Court Justice should not be a lifetime position, and she is a perfect example.Â  Now we have probably all been guilty of dozing off in class at one point or another, but I highly doubt any of us have fallen asleep during the Finals.Â  Yes, I did get super baked before my Chemistry final, but I got a 98 so suck on that.Â  Ruth Bader Ginsberg, however, decided that she needed to take a nap while the Supreme Court decided on whether or not Tom DeLayâs redistricting of Texas should be upheld.Â  But she sleeps, even though many look to her to help the cause of the minorities who are being disenfranchised.Â  So Fuck You Ruth Bader Ginsberg.Â  Youâre just lucky you werenât sitting next to Clarence Thomas, he would have had a field day.</p>
<p>Then we have Congressman Conyers (d-IL) This is the type of guy that makes me realize that we have no party in the country that looks out for the people of this country.Â  Conyers decided that your tax dollars would be best spent paying his aides to babysit and chauffer his kids around.Â  No wonder the Senate voted against creating and Ethic review board to oversee our Senators lack of Ethics.Â  Fuck You Conyers.Â  I hope your kids end up hating you for pawning them off on your employees.</p>
<p>And Fuck You Rep Shelley Berkley (d-NV).Â  Yes we know the Katrina relief funding bill was going to pass whether you were there or not.Â  But to skip the vote in order to get a neck lift is just ridiculous.Â  First of all, your face looks like youâve been beaten too many times with the ugly stick.Â  Tightening that glob of shit around your neck is not going to make you any more photogenic.Â  Secondly, did your health plan pay for this, or was it a gift from the plastic surgery lobby?Â  Fuck You Congresswoman Berkley, you only give fodder to the assholes who think women shouldnât be in power. (Madam President, we are under attack.Â  Yeah yeah, does my ass look fat in thisâ¦Â  OK, that could probably go for Bush too.)</p>
<p>And a Fuck You to Democrats in General.Â  You are a bunch of Pussies, and I usually only like to use that word in a good way.Â  For six years youâve just been following along saying âYes Master,â to everything the Republicans have laid out.Â  No wonder Bush thinks he can get away with murder.Â  Where the Fuck is the call of impeachment.Â  I donât fucking care if it wonât pass, at least fucking bring it up.Â  Our entire government is to blame for the situation we are in.Â  Fuck you Hillary.Â  Fuck You Ted.Â  Fuck You Democrats.Â  Get off your pussy asses and get some fucking work done.Â </p>
<p>Special Mention goes to the guy who didnât call Tiffany back.Â  That may not quite merit a Fuck You (though Tiffany may argue that), it does merit a Screw You.Â  So Screw You guy that didnât call.<br />
