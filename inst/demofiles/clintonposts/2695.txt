<div><p>Christian News Wire <a href="http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/85181790.html">reports</a> that Rev. Thomas J. Euteneuer, president of Human Life International, has repsonded to the news that President Bush is apparently supporting "Andrew von Eschenbach and his recent decision to seek over-the-counter (OTC) status for the abortifacient drug Plan B." Rev. Euteneur's comments <a href="http://www.hli.org/press_releases_withdraw_von_eschenbach.html">can be read</a> on the HLI website:</p><blockquote><p>âDr. von Eschenbachâs kowtowing under pressure from Senator Hillary Clinton (D-NY), and enabling Barr Pharmaceuticals to submit a new application for the over-the-counter use of their abortion-causing synthetic hormone Plan B disqualifies him from being an independent commissioner for the FDA...â</p></blockquote><p>If President Bush does stick with his support of the abortifacient drug Plan B, will it be the end of his support from Catholics who have embraced him, to one degree or another, as being pro-life? </p></div>
