<p><font size="2">Ankle boots are the &#8220;must-have&#8221; shoe of the season. <strong>Sienna Miller</strong> and <strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong> wear them with mini-skirts, while <strong>Hillary Duff</strong> and <strong>Kirsten Dunst</strong> have been seen wearing them with shorts. If you feel a little less daring, you can always pair them with a great pair of skinny jeans. We love these super-chic boots by YIN. The style is Indigo and they cost $395. </font>
