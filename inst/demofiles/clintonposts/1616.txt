<p>So, I changed my mind, and I don't support Hillary Clinton for President.&nbsp; Apparently, when <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/21/iraq.hillary/">she voted for the resolution</a> to give President Bush blah blah blah to invade Iraq and do whatever, she did because she thought there was &quot;a grave threat to the United States.&quot; Anybody who is as well-informed as Hillary Clinton cannot possibly think that Iraq posed a grave threat to the US.&nbsp; For starters, Bush was obviously lying, but even if you believed him, you'd have to be just dumb as hell to think that Saddam Hussein and his fledgling forces in the middle of nowhere were going to do anything.&nbsp; Frankly, he had bigger problems.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; Problems like the fact that half the people in his country want to kill the other half.&nbsp; Or that his country was surrounded by Fundamentalist nations with tons of oil money, no infrastructure, no middle class, and people who hated Iraq (and the US and Israel even more).&nbsp; Problems that are now ours.&nbsp; So when Hillary Clinton (and Kerry, Edwards, McCain, etc.) say that they supported toppling Saddam and his WMD's, but are just outraged by how poorly we planned for the aftermath, I can't vote for them.&nbsp; Its like someone decided to remove Little League umpire's because they made the belligerent fathers so angry, and then being surprised when things delve into anarchy and the drunken dads start beating the crap out of each other.&nbsp; Then saying, &quot;well, gee, I'm glad we got rid of that damn umpire, I just wish we'd planned the aftermath better.&quot;&nbsp; America was better off with Saddam in power. Period.&nbsp; Stephen Colbert can admit it, and I'll vote for ANYONE else who can too.</p>
<p>P.S. In 1917, Germany shipped Lenin, a political criminal, from exile in Switzerland to Russia.&nbsp; He took over the country, and brief stabilized it before he died.&nbsp; Now, I'm not saying we should ship Saddam back to Iraq. I'm just saying maybe we should loosen up security around his jail cell.</p>
