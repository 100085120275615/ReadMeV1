<div><p><span><img src="http://frantzrantz.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/linkhillary.clinton" alt="Linkhillary" border="0" title="Linkhillary" />Hillary supporters and liberals of all types say this ad "compares" Hillary to Osama bin Laden.</span></p>

<p><span>Even the Drudge Report headline reads, in capital letters: "HILLARY COMPARED TO BIN LADEN IN SENATE AD".</span></p>

<p><span>Problem is, the ad does no such thing.</span></p>

<p><span>Watch it for yourself </span><a href="http://www.spencerforsenate.com/site/c.euLPK3MNItG/b.981431/k.CB42/Home.htm"><strong><span>HERE</span></strong></a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>Yes, it does put her picture next to his...right after recapping her Senate voting record that weakens our ability to fight terrorists, but at no point in the ad does the narrator "compare" Hillary to Osama.</span></p>

<p><span>If you watch it and listen, the ad claims that Islamic fascists still hate us and want to kill us. Which is true.</span></p>

<p><span>It then points out that Hillary has voted against the Patriot Act and NSA wiretap programs, which are necessary tools in fighting terrorism. Which is also true.</span></p>

<p><span>So at what point does the ad "compare" Hillary to OBL? At what point does it claim that she's the same as the man who masterminded the mass murder of Americans on 9/11 and on numerous other occasions since al Quaeda was formed?</span></p>

<p><span><strong>IT DOESN'T.</strong></span></p>

<p><span>But I'll leave it to you: Does the ad cross the line?</span></p></div>
