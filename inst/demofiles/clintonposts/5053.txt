However, given the short amount of time I have to read through, edit and post these, some lame ones may get through (as I am sure a lot have!)... Please email me at the address above and let me know if some (or many, it's certainly possible) are just regurgigated versions of other facts and I will purge such crap ASAP.. Thanks.
