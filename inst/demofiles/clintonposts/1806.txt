<br />Okay Kids.  What have we learned?<br />
<br />Well, weâre obviously doing something right.  Thatâs the only conclusion any sane person can come to after the Islamic-fascistâs planned sequel to 9/11 was thwarted yesterday. (Kudos to President Bush for finally using the term âIslamic- fascistsâ to describe these murderers, by the way.)<br />
<br />We have learned that those who told us that our nation has not been made safer since 9/11 were dead wrong.  Without the devices and safeguards put in place since that fateful day five years ago we would most likely have had another thousand dead Americans or so to mourn yesterday afternoon.<br />
<br />We have learned that the NSA wiretapping program is essential to figuring out what the terrorists are planning and how they are planning it.  It works.  Sorry Mr. Conyers, you wont be able to impeach the president on that issue, but youâre a big dummy so Iâm sure youâll continue trying.<br />
<br />By the way, a big thanks to The New York Times for not exposing the governmentâs information on this plot before these guys could be nabbed at Heathrow.  We really appreciate it.<br />
<br />We now know that despite the mistakes that the Bush Administration has made in the war on terror, they are clearly not as incompetent as some would like us to believe.  If you canât admit that this administration has done a good job of preventing another terrorist attack in this country, then your drinking way too much Kool-Aid.<br />
<br />A rather pleasant surprise in this whole ordeal is how big of a help the government of Pakistan was in breaking up this deadly plot.  It seems an amazing coincidence that the one guy in that country that doesnât want to destroy America is also the president.<br />
<br />Based on discussions that Iâve had with people on both sides over the last 24 hours, as well as listening to political radio and television coverage of recent events and the negative vibes that Iâm receiving from LAX, I am sensing a high level of support for what has come to be known as racial profiling. <br />
<br /> Iâve concluded that this is a great idea that most common sense Americans would love to try out.  As someone who could potentially fall into the category of an individual to be profiled, that being a male between the ages of 18 and 45 of Middle Eastern descent, I think it would be to everyoneâs benefit to give Muhammad and me a bit more scrutiny at the airport and let Grandma Doris from Minnesota go through without being prodded by the guy with the wand.<br />

<br />Wearing a headdress?  Search âEm.<br />
<br />Smell like rosewater?  Youâre getting searched.<br />
<br />Speak Arabic and have a crazy beard?  Yup, a little more scrutiny is in order.<br />
<br />Potentially Middle Eastern looking guy carrying a Gatorade and a disposable camera?  <br />
<br />Duh!<br />
<br />Not all Muslims are terrorists, but all of these terrorists are Muslims.<br />
<br />While today was a great day for America and a huge victory in the war on terror, there are a few folks who one canât help but feel sorry for.<br />
<br />First among those is Senator Joe Lieberman.  If the Connecticut primary had been scheduled for a week later, he would have won. <br />

<br />
<br />Many Democrats have had awful short term memory problems since 9/11, but todayâs events would probably have served as a reminder to all of them that the terrorist threat still exists and that Senator Lieberman has been one of the only Democrats who has been in support of the positive steps that the Bush Administration has taken to combat it, without politicizing those initiatives in order to pander to the Cindy Sheehan wing of the party which now controls its machinery.  <br />
<br />I still believe that Lieberman will win the general election as an independent, but he doesnât deserve the kind of treatment that he has received from the party which he has voted with  90% of the time.  Come on all you Kos-Bloggers, put the poor guys web-site back on-line.<br />
<br />I also feel bad for Cynthia McKinney, whoâs accusations of voter fraud will now go largely unnoticed, destroying her chances of returning to office and telling everyone about how the recent terror bust was manufactured by the Bush administration to raise the terror alert level and take everyoneâs mind off of the fact that Bush hates black people.<br />
<br />Finally, I feel sorry for the Democratic party as a whole, as well as the liberals who have taken over that party since Bill Clinton left office.  They were so close to convincing voters that they were better suited to lead congress, not because of their ideas and competence, but rather because they were not Republicans.<br />
<br />Now that convincing will take a lot more effort.<br />
<br /> You see, every time Americanâs are reminded that terrorism is the most important issue of our time and that the threat from Islamic-fascism is real and still very much alive within this small world which we live in, many of them realize that the aggressive anti-terror policies of the Bush administration are not as awful as the administrations detractors claim.<br />
<br />When they actually see these policies work, swing voters understand and appreciate George W. Bush a bit more, warts and all.  I hope that goes for Tony Blair in England as well.<br />
<br />The good guys won today, but we must remain diligent.<br />

<br />Be patient at the airports over the next few days and thank God that the people in those airplanes did not suffer the same fate which befell those in The World Trade Center, The Pentagon and that field in Pennsylvania.<br />
<br />Also, regardless of your partisan leanings or what you may think about our government, donât be too proud to give our nationâs leaders credit where credit is due.</div>
