<div>Andâ¦The inevitable happened! Iâm having a bad hair day. I fucking hate that cunt of a hairstylist who totally screwed up my hair. Grrr! I was really tempted to pimp slap that bitch. I told her that I wanted to spike my hair. Coz I want that âmessyâ look style. Like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/liverpool/music/2004/04/summer_pops/mid1.jpg">this</a>. I thought she knew how I wanted my hair done because she had already cut my hair in the past.<br />
<br />Unfortunately, she had cut my hair several times with different styles, and she did the one that I absolutely abhorred. And before I could even start complaining, she had already started pounding on my poor head with the electric razor. She did the short and round hairstyle thatâs shaved using a number 2 razor on the side and a number 4 on top. Got a clue yet? No? Okay, itâs a crossover between Natalie Portmanâs hair in V for Vendetta and Hillary Swankâs in Boys Donât Cry. Since Iâm just a slob from the Garbage State, I donât look all Hollywood-ish in this hair but more like an inmate at the Shawshank Prison who had just been put on a death row. If Iâll be in Shawshank, I wouldnât want to look more butch than Hillary fucking Swank. I want my curlers damnit!<br />
<br />In conclusion, BAD HAIR = BAD DAY. But, since it would need at least a month before my hair grows long again, then BAD HAIR = BAD MONTH. My hair is so bad I totally deserve to win the grand prize at the Worst Hair Contest.<br />
