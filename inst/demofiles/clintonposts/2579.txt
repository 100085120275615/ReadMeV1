I got some really fun mail today.  My pal <a href="http://pamkittymorning.blogspot.com">Pam</a> was kind enough to send me these great white tea towels which will be perfect for embroidering on - plus she sent the sweetest card with a tea bag of my favorite - Scottish Breakfast tea. Yeah! Thanks Pam!  I also got (finally) my Cloth, Paper, Scissors Fall issue - love this magazine!   I also got THIS FABULOUS Japanese craft magazine which I got off e-bay.<a href="http://wrensnest.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/magazines.jpg"><img src="http://wrensnest.typepad.com/wrensnest/images/magazines.jpg" title="Magazines" height="165" width="250" alt="Magazines" border="0" /></a> <a href="http://wrensnest.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/book1.jpg"><img src="http://wrensnest.typepad.com/wrensnest/images/book1.jpg" title="Book1" height="300" width="200" alt="Book1" border="0" /></a><a href="http://wrensnest.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/book20001_1.jpg"><img src="http://wrensnest.typepad.com/wrensnest/images/book20001_1.jpg" title="Book20001_1" height="249" width="200" alt="Book20001_1" border="0" /></a><br />
This one is Volume 3 (I don't know the rest of the title - Emboidery and something.)  There are also volumes 1 and 2, which I will be on the lookout for too since this one is so great! I've finally figured out how to scan the pages so I've included a couple. Don't you just love the coin purses and isn't that little jump roping girl the cutest?? I could go on and on - there are so many wonderful things in here! </p>

<p>Also in the pic with Pam's towels and card are the fun Jacquard paints I got at Richard's (a local craft store) in cool aqua/tuquoise and apple green.  I really am going to try freezer paper stencil.  It looks so fun and what a great way to decorate Meg's t-shirts for school to make them really unique (she likes to not look like everyone else) and we can make them together. Hopefully I'll have the results soon - we just need to pick a design!  I also found these great ribbons at Richard's - they were in the scrapbook area, but I can use them on pincushions. The colors are so fantastic!! I am really loving aqua, brown and orange these days. Who knew??</p>

<p>Lastly, here is my little stitchette - Anna Angles - designed by Hillary at <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com">Wee Wonderfuls</a>.  She is so cute and was so fun to do - I was actually making her for a gift, but the Williams Sonoma flour sack towel I used, tore right where I put the hoop.  I think I pulled on it too much. I must say that the towels Pam sent are very nice and strong and much thicker than the Williams Sonoma ones. So Anna is staying with me and I'll have to try again (with different towels).<br />
