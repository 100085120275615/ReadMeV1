<div>They're at it again.<br />
<br />Last week, ex-President Clinton said that he had such great respect for Rep. Murtha (D-PA) that he would have to consider Murtha's position on withdrawing American troops from Afghanistan and Iraq ASAP.  After the House vote against that position, Senator Clinton said that withdrawing the troops would be a big mistake.<br />
<br />The ex-President talks to the left wing of the Democratic Party.  The Senator talks to the more centrist wing of the party.  They are the leading fundraisers.  They will be tough to stop in both '06 and '08, barring any scandal involving Hillary.  CAVEAT:  Sex scandals involving Hillary will not count as they will be seen as revenge on Bill - unless any such scandal involves minors or gets PETA petulant.</div>
