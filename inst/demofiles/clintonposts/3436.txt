<div>Now for another installment of <em>End of the Week Stream of Consciousness.....</em>
<br />
<br />Why is it that the media picks Ohio State at or near the top of the college football rankings every year. The only title they've won since the Eisenhower administration is the one they stole from Miami...<br />
<br />Sports Illustrated also jipped my alma mater -- Long Beach Polytechnic High School in the High School football rankings. This is the same school they crowned, "The best high school athletic program in the country." <a href="http://premium.si.cnn.com/pr/subs/siexclusive/2005/pr/subs/siexclusive/05/11/top.high0516/index.html">Click here for the article</a>. Those on staff at Highland Oaks know that I can hardly shut up about "The Home of Scholars and Champions." We got jipped this year.<br />

</a>Pastor Terry Hornbuckle was convicted of three counts of rape this week for drugging and raping 3 women. He's facing 2 to 20 years in prison. His has also been indicted on additional charges of sexual assault, possession of methamphetamine, retaliation and tampering with a witness. He and his church are also facing lawsuits from some of the women accusing him of rape. Not a good week for preachers. I feel the desire to pray for he, his wife, kids, church, and the women that he brutalized. What a sad and horrible situation.<br />
<br />If I was Bill Parcells...I'd ask the team trainer today how serious he though T.O.'s injury was. If he said anything other than pull or tear of the hamstring, I'd tell T.O. to be on the field for practice tomorrow. If he wasn't, I'd suspend him for the first game of the season. If he threw a hiss and took it to the press...I'd make it four..or more. If it continued, I'd keep going. T.O.'s total grade as a player includes more than how he performs on game day. It includes his net impact on every around him...which is negative...<br />
<br />Who thinks up all the plots for the various CSI and Law and Order shows? Last night, I watched reruns where the team found a scuba diver in a tree and a human eyeball in a bird's nest...<br />
<br />Potentially tough times for Tom Cruise. He, Tom Hanks, Russell Crowe, and Johnny Depp have to be the best actors of <em>this</em> generation. Am I leaving anyone out?<br />
<br />The best actresses? Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Keira Knightley, Meryl Streep (though she is more last generation), Angelina Jolie... I know I'm leaving some out. Maybe Kate Hudson, Hillary Swank?<br />
<br />My church-related thought of the week... FACILITIES DO MATTER.</div>
