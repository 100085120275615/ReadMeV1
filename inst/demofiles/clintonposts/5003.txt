<span>Democrats vs Walmart</span><br /><br />Stories like this make me a little less worried about a dem takeover of the house and senate. So what is the most pressing issue for the United States? Is it terrorism, war, energy, inflation? Nope, according to a growing number of dems the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/17/washington/17dems.html?ei=5090&en=082dce1f1f00051b&ex=1313467200&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss&pagewanted=all">the most pressing issue is Walmart.</a><br /><br /><blockquote>Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, a likely Democratic presidential candidate in 2008, delivered a 15-minute, blistering attack to warm applause from Democrats and union organizers here on Wednesday. But Mr. Bidenâs main target was not Republicans in Washington, or even his prospective presidential rivals.<br /><br />It was Wal-Mart, the nationâs largest private employer.<br /><br />Among Democrats, Mr. Biden is not alone. Across Iowa this week and across much of the country this month, Democratic leaders have found a new rallying cry that many of them say could prove powerful in the midterm elections and into 2008: denouncing Wal-Mart for what they say are substandard wages and health care benefits.<br /><br />Six Democratic presidential contenders have appeared at rallies like the one Mr. Biden headlined, along with some Democratic candidates for Congress in some of the toughest-fought races in the country.<br /><br />âMy problem with Wal-Mart is that I donât see any indication that they care about the fate of middle-class people,â Mr. Biden said, standing on the sweltering rooftop of the State Historical Society building here. âThey talk about paying them $10 an hour. Thatâs true. How can you live a middle-class life on that?â<br /><br />The focus on Wal-Mart is part of a broader strategy of addressing what Democrats say is general economic anxiety and a growing sense that economic gains of recent years have not benefited the middle class or the working poor.<br /><br />Their alliance with the anti-Wal-Mart campaign dovetails with their emphasis in Washington on raising the minimum wage and doing more to make health insurance affordable. It also suggests they will go into the midterm Congressional elections this fall and the 2008 presidential race striking a populist tone.<br /><br />Some Democrats expressed concern about the direction the party was heading, saying it could turn back efforts by such party leaders as former President Bill Clinton to erase the image of the party as anti-business and scare off corporations that might be inclined to make contributions.</blockquote>
