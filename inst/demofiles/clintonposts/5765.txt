âThe Big Choice Electionâ<br /><br />Source: <a href="http://newt.org/index.php?src=gendocs&link=Newt%27s%20Election%20Analysis&category=Web%20Page" target="_blank">Newt.org</a><br /><br />Dr. Newt Gingrich (D-Ga.), former Speaker of the House of Representatives, ever insightful and succinct, has captured the essence of the 2004 Presidential Election like no other commentator. Newtâs analysis â available in full from Newt.org in free audio downloads and a twenty-one page white paper â clearly contrasts the difference between Democratic Nominee Senator John Forbes Kerry and the majority of the American people. <br /><br />Newtâs white paper entitled: âWhatâs at stake in 2004: The Gap between the Kerry-Edwards Ticket and the Values of the American People,â illustrates five major issues from a study of thirty-four issues on which the Kerry ticket is completely out of the mainstream. After reading Speaker Gingrichâs analysis, one will find ample reason for the <em>National Journal</em> to award the title of most liberal senator to John F. Kerry.<br /><br />In the last of the three Presidential debates, President Bush described John Kerry in these words: âYou know, there's a main stream in American politics and you sit right on the far left bank. As a matter of fact, your record is such that Ted Kennedy, your colleague, is the conservative senator from Massachusetts.â It is no small political feat to have a voting record that is more liberal than Senator Ted Kennedy or Senator Hillary Rodham-Clinton. <br /><br />Yet in his twenty year senate career, John Kerry has in fact accomplished this feat. And although his running mate has only been in the United States Senate for a single term, Senator John Edwards has secured the number four position in the liberal rankings. The number one liberal picked the number four liberal as his running mate. As President Bush likes to chide on the stump, âIn Massachusetts, thatâs what they call âbalancing the ticketâ.â <br /><br />What specific issues does the Speaker evaluate in order to prove the Presidentâs accusation that John Kerry is on the âfar left bankâ of the left liberal establishment? The issue on which the greatest gap exists between Senator Kerry and the American people is on the issue of keeping the phrase âone nation, under Godâ in the Pledge of Allegiance. Newtâs white paper cites that ninety-one percent (91%) of the American people believe that phrase should remain in the United States Pledge of Allegiance. âIn direct contrast to Kerryâs stated views, by 71 to 24 Americans believe that the Constitution promises freedom of religion, not freedom from religion (Pew July 2003).â  <br /><br />No sane voter would doubt that John Kerry would appoint liberal, left-wing federal judges who would continue to issue judicial opinions like the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling against the âunder Godâ in our Pledge. The Judicial branch, as the speaker believes, is the last bastion of liberal control in our Federal government. The House and Senate are no longer under the liberal thumb. Likewise, the Presidency is (for the moment) friendly to the views of the American majority. The last stronghold of liberal ideology is the Judiciary. We need a President who will appoint judges that interpret law, not legislate from the federal bench.<br /><br />Below is my own attempt to condense the depth of Speaker Gingrichâs study on the gap between the Kerry-Edwards ticket and the American people. It should be noted that nearly everything below is not my own thought - and Speaker Gingrich has listed all the citations of his sources in the white paper mentioned at the beginning of this post. <br /><br />After reading this list, can anyone of you even consider giving a vote to the liberals and John Kerry? <br /><br />1.	A work requirement for welfare: 87% of Americans say yes, 5% No. John Kerry and the Senate Democrats have blocked the bill for 3 years.<br />2.	Government should help faith-based initiatives help the poor: 72% of Americans agree, 26% disagree; Kerry is with the 26%.<br />3.	U.S. interests are more important than international organizations: 73-24; Kerryâs positions favor the 24%.<br />4.	Violent attackers of pregnant women who kill the baby should be prosecuted for killing the baby: 84% of Americans say yes, 9% No. Kerry and Edwards both voted no.<br />5.	Children should be allowed to pray at school: 78% of Americans agree; Kerry is against it.<br />6.	In 1985 Kerry introduced three amendments to provide tax paid subsidies for alcoholics and drug abusers (9/8/95).<br />7.	In 1992 (9/17) Kerry favored a federally funded needle exchange program for drug users.<br />8.	This view of subordinating America to an international organization is rejected by the American people 73 to 24 (Gallup March 2004) in favor of America being able to pursue its own policies. Yet, as noted below under the question of our survival John Kerry has consistently talked about subordinating the United States to the United Nationsâ¦<br />9.	Americans know the world is dangerous. Better than eight out of every ten Americans (82%) believe international terrorism is a critical threat. Three out of four Americans (75%) believe the spread of weapons of mass destruction to unfriendly nations is a major threat. (Gallup Poll February 2004) By contrast, John Kerry ran as an anti-defense liberal in 1984 and proposed cutting $45 to $54 billion from the Reagan defense budget in one year and cutting $200 billion in defense over four years.<br />10.	While serving under Governor Michael Dukakis as Lieutenant Governor, Kerry wrote and spoke for Executive Order 242 (June 28, 1984) in which the state of Massachusetts refused to think about or plan for any effort to survive a nuclear attack. In effect, this repudiated the very concept of Homeland Security. Under Kerryâs leadership, they deliberately left Massachusetts defenseless against a weapon of mass destruction.<br />11.	Kerry was for a one sided nuclear freeze in which the United States would do nothing while the Soviets could continue to build up their arms. He opposed putting Pershing II and cruise missiles in Europe to match the Soviet Unionâs SS-20 missiles. It is reasonable to assert that had we followed Kerryâs policies instead of Reaganâs there would still be a Soviet Union and we would still be in a cold war.<br />12.	In 1970, as a congressional candidate Kerry said âthe United Nations should have control over most of our foreign military operations. Iâm an internationalist. Iâd like to see our troops dispersed through the world only at the direction of the United Nations.â (Harvard Crimson 1/18/70)<br />13.	While the left has a fixation with multilateral consultation, international approval and limiting American action to those others approve is actually a distinct minority viewpoint. By better than three to one (70% to 20%) Americans believe a pro-American point of view is good (Pew Research Center 2003).<br />14.	By nearly three to one (74%), Americans oppose removing all references to God from oaths of public office<br />15.	Nearly three out of four (73%) approve of school prayer before athletic games<br />16.	More than three out of four (78%) favor allowing children to pray on school grounds. Kerry opposed a voluntary school prayer amendment (9/10/85) saying it was âa first stepâ to âestablish an official religion in this country.â<br />17.	By 85 to 15 Americans say religion is very or fairly important in their lives. Only 15% say it is unimportant (Gallup June, 2004).<br />18.	The current position of the Kerry-Edwards team and their leftwing allies is that no Catholic, Orthodox Jewish, or fundamentalist Protestant nominee for judge who would follow their religious beliefs should be confirmed to serve on the Federal Appeals Court or Supreme Court.<br />19.	By 45 to 1 Americans are either extremely or very proud to be an American (91%) while 2% are not proud (ABC/Washington Post poll, September 2002). Obviously Michael Moore and many of his âcontempt for Americaâ friends fit into the 2%. (Remember, Moore wants Kerry to be elected.)<br />20.	The public believes âschools should make a special effort to teach new immigrants about American valuesâ (88% agree) (Public Agenda September 21, 1998).<br />21.	Parents agree that schools should focus on teaching students how to be American. When asked âwhat should be a bigger priority: teaching students to be proud of being part of this country and learning the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, or focusing on instilling pride in their ethnic groupâs identity and heritage?â (Public Agenda September 21, 1998): 79% of all parents chose pride and learning in America. 18% chose their group. 80% of Hispanic parents chose focusing on America. 17% chose their group. 73% of all foreign born parents chose learning about America. 23% chose their group. 66% of African American parents chose learning about America. 29% chose their group.<br />22.	Americans are so concerned about teaching Americaâs language and culture that by 65 to 26 they believe schools should help new immigrants absorb Americaâs language and culture even if their native language and culture are neglected (Public Agenda September 21, 1998).<br />23.	English is still seen as essential and 81% of all Americans believe immigrants should learn English.<br />24.	By 82 to 14 Americans would require teachers to pass a standard test before they could be allowed to teach.<br />25.	By 81 to 9 Americans would require teachers to be retested and certified every five years.<br />26.	By 85 to 8 Americans favor an education reform package that includes tougher teacher standards and more local control over schools and expands the use of computers and new technology in the classroom.<br />27.	By 64% to 33% Americans would expand charter schools and school choice programs to give parents and their children more options to attend a high quality school that best meets their need (Public Opinion Strategies February, 2004). This would clearly be deeply opposed by most of the left-liberal establishment.<br />28.	By more than 17 to 1 (87% to 5%) Americans believe we should limit the benefits for able-bodied welfare recipients to two years and require them to do community work, attend school, and participate in a job training program (Public Opinion Strategies 1998/1999).<br />29.	Americans also believe faith based efforts might be effective in helping the poor. By 72% to 26% Americans support expanding state financial support of faith based charitable organizations to help provide critical services to children, seniors, battered women, the disabled, the homeless and other at risk groups (Public Opinion Strategies February 2004).<br />30.	John Kerry is opposed to the vast majority of Americans on work requirements. Kerry opposed work requirements for welfare in June 1988, June 1993, September 1995 and July 1996. Americans who favor a work requirement outnumber leftists like Kerry who oppose work requirements by 17 to 1.<br />31.	Newtâs analysis of the American flag is so vital â it bears quoting below in full: Americans generally are proud of their flag. By 69% to 29% Americans display a flag. A majority of Americans are deeply offended by actions which disgrace, demean and destroy the flag. 79% think it should be illegal to burn it (ABC/Washington Post July 12, 1998). That majority of Americans strongly supports an amendment to protect the flag (63% in 1999 according to Gallup) and would support a motion to simply strip the Court of the ability to protect flag burners. John Kerry has not only voted three times against an amendment to protect the American flag but he has gone a step even further to the left and viciously attacked those who would protect the flag. In what one reporter described as âperhaps the strongest speech against the amendmentâ Kerry compared those protecting the flag to âIran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, China, Cuba, Syria, and Sudan.â Kerry went on to assert that with a flag burning amendment âwe could join this list of dictatorial, authoritarian, and discredited regimes.â The gap between traditional Americans and a presidential candidate of the left could hardly be wider.<br />32.	People have a deep sense that Union leaders have unfair power and 69% of the American people favor stopping unions from automatically deducting money for political contributions and forcing unions to use only voluntary donations while only 12% disagree (Public Opinion Strategies 1998/99).<br />33.	Americans instinctively believe that lower taxes can help increase economic growth. In 2004 by better than two to one (67% to 26%) Americans favored reducing their state income taxes so they could keep more of what they earned and have more money to boost the state economy (Public Opinion Strategies February 2004).<br />34.	By better than two to one (65% to 27%), Americans favor the complete elimination of the estate tax (National Annenberg Election Survey 2004).<br />35.	By nearly 7 to 1 (75% to 11%), Americans would limit the amount of money personal injury lawyers (AKA Kerryâs running mate Sen. John Edwards) can claim to no more than 15% of money awarded (Public Opinion Strategies 1998/99).<br />36.	By almost 7 to 1 (85% to 13%), Americans would cut taxes on employers who offer health care benefits to their employees to reduce the problem for the uninsured (Public Opinion Strategies February 2004).<br />37.	Despite the end of the âdot comâ bubble and several years of weak stock markets, the American people favor allowing workers to invest in some Social Security contributions in the stock market by 57% to 36%.<br />38.	On Medicare the country is overwhelmingly committed to helping seniors. By 9 to 1 (81% to 7%) Americans want to provide funds for poorer seniors to help pay for prescription drug costs (Public Opinion Strategies 1998/1999). Ironically the Republicans actually delivered on this goal in 2003 but they are so unused to taking credit for improving a social program that the liberals have done a better job lying about the Medicare drug bill than the Republicans have done telling the truth. If Republicans communicate accurately what they have done for seniors they stand to gain significant support and to further isolate the left.<br />
