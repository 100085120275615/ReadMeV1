<div>Hillary Clinton was unveiled today at New York's Museum of Sex, where sculptor Daniel Edwards hopes it will spark discussion about sex, politics and celebrity.<br />Edwards, the artist who also created a life-size nude of Britney Spears giving birth on a bear-skin rug, said he wanted to capture Clinton's age and femininity in the sculpture.<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2464/1763/1600/hillary_clinton_statue.jpg">

</a>Clinton's office had no immediate comment.<br />Edwards said his work features soft "presidential smile" and wrinkles framing her eyes. A floral pattern runs across her breasts, part of Edwards' effort to present Clinton "as a woman -- not a covered up person, but as a woman."<br />"I didn't want to give her a face lift or change her age," he said of his work.<br />

</a>"The key was to reveal her chest a little bit. She usually covers herself up, but I don't think that's necessary."<br />This is as sexy as Hillary is ever going to look...</div>
