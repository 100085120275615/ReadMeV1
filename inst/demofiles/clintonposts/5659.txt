This will be my last blog entry here at <a href="http://natdug.blogspot.com">tha dug out</a>. I had hoped to end the blog on its two year anniversary, but work made sure that didn't happen. While my anniversary may have come and gone, I thought that the end of my days at <a href="http://www.blogger.com">blogger</a> warranted a good closing entry. <br /><br />Again, I'd like to thank everyone who visited <a href="http://natdug.blogspot.com">tha dug out</a>...on purpose or by accident. Special thanks go out to <a href="http://charliekane.blogspot.com/">Charlie</a>, who got me into this whole blogging thing in the first place. It's been quite the journey...and I'm better for it. <br /><br />In my absence from cyberspace, I encourage you to continue to check out my blogroll. Visit <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~lisachamb/">Lisa's Livejournal</a> for some guaranteed laughs and all the online quizzes that you could ever want (though <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~sex_n_pancakes/">Robin</a> could give her a run for the money). Take a trip down South, courtesy of the <a href="http://cge.typepad.com/">Carolina Gentleman Esquire</a>, a man with whom I agree on far more issues than you'd think if you met either of us in person. Or, check out Scott from <a href="http://demwatch.blogspot.com">Demwatch's</a> new home at <a href="http://scott-shields.mydd.com/">MyDD</a>.Or, if you're really fiending for some of my commentary, keep checkin' out <a href="http://thedailyrebellion.blogspot.com">The Daily Rebellion</a>, where I might offer some guest postings from time-to-time.<br /><br />At any rate, enjoy this last one...<br /><br /><b>Personal Updates</b>: In my previous entry, I talked about my upcoming stint as a Writing Coach at the <a href="http://www.du.edu/">University of Denver</a>. It's been nearly a month since that experience and I'm still awed by it. For all the confusion and frustration that came from my four days as a Writing Coach, I am a changed person because of it.<br /><br />It's funny because you walk in, arrogantly thinking that somehow you'll help these kids...that, if you're lucky, you'll be able to change the course of someone's life. And while the post-workshop "fallout" has convinced me that that happened, I'm convinced that those kids helped me far more than I could ever help them. <br /><br />I can't even really begin to explain it...so I'll just say it was an incredible experience, which changed me fundamentally, and folks will no doubt see the extensions of that change in the coming months. <br /><br /><b>Shout Outs</b>: I haven't had the opportunity to send a card or anything, but I want to congratulate <a href="http://www.johnborwick.com/blog">John</a> and Lauren on their recent engagement (and for an engagement story which might be as reminscient of the people getting married, as any I've ever heard...very pragmatic, very John)....<br /><br />Huge shout out to my department's summer intern, Harry, who will have his last day at work tomorrow. I don't want to say he was better than the other summer interns in our national or regional offices, but...he was. He's been a real pleasure to have around the office and he's handled one of the most frustrating tasks (travel) with unparalleled grace. So, huge shout outs to you, Harry...you rock!<br /><br /><b>Homesick</b>: I don't miss much about North Carolina. I miss my family and friends, of course, but I talk to them often enough that I still feel like they're a presence in my life (and truth be told, distance has done wonders for my relationship with my parents). I've learned how to bring some of the comforts of home to DC--from joining the NC Democratic Club to game watches with the DC NCSU Alumni group to perfecting my own recipes for Southern fried chicken and sweet tea--I'm becoming a lot more comfortable with life here.<br /><br />That said, the discussion of tuition autonomy for UNC-Chapel Hill and NC State down at the General Assembly certainly had me missing life in my home state. For years, talk of tuition kept me out of the classroom and down on Jones Street, attempting to talk sense into the minds legislators. There's no doubt, had I been in North Carolina, I would've been back on Jones Street...and I missed that. <br /><br />While I'm glad to hear that the NC House, effectively, squashed the effort at the legislature, the UNC Board of Governor's <a href="http://64.136.60.221/cgi-bin/article.pl?a=200508121">creation of tuition policy task force</a> to examine the issue still gives some air of legitimacy to this ridiculous proposal. It's just wrong...spin it anyway you want, but giving tuition autonomy to the two Research I institutions in the UNC system is just wrong. <br /><br />Tuition would go up, every single year...make no mistake about it. Trustees at UNC and NCSU have, on every single opportunity they've been given, sought to raise tuition. Every. Single. Time. Typically, I'd go on a rant about why tuition increases are horrible and how they are jeopardizing access...but that's not even the main issue for me.<br /><br />I hate when people lump Carolina and NC State together. I understand that we're the Research I institutions in the 16 campus system, but outside of that, the similarities are few and far between. We've got different demographics--NCSU receives less federal money for financial aid, despite having a needier student body, comparatively. We've got different alumni bases--despite State's best efforts, our endowment will never come close to what UNC pulls in (this is significant, of course, because endowments fund scholarships). We've got different histories--despite Carolina's contention, NC State is the <b><i>real</i></b> people's university. NC State is a land grant institution, provided by the good people of the state "to teach agriculture, military tactics, and the mechanic arts as well as classical studies so that members of the working classes could obtain a liberal, practical education." NC State has a special obligation to North Carolinians, UNC does not. <br /><br />We're not the same--quit trying to sell NC State down the river with Carolina. Bastids. <br /><br />Sidenote: Doesn't it seem counterproductive to allow autonomy to the schools that people already percieve as being the best? Why not give the autonomy to other schools, who have long been underfunded when competing with Carolina and State for money in the North Carolina budget? Stupid, stupid, stupid. <br /><br /><b>Random Political Notes</b>: Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) has a new opponent in her quest for re-election. Last Tuesday, <a href="http://www.jeaninepirro.com/">Jeanine Pirro</a>, a District Attorney from Upstate New York, announced her candidacy for the US Senate. The good news for the GOP is that, despite her lackadaisical announcement (probably the worst political announcement I've ever seen), they've got a moderate Republican, who (when briefed) can go toe-to-toe with Clinton on the issues (and, let's face it, the fact that she's a woman doesn't hurt either). The bad news, of course, is that Clinton's done a fine job as New York's junior senator and...well...Pirro's husband makes Bill Clinton look like a choir boy. As it wasn't bad enough to deal with Hillary's celebrity, now the campaign's got a green light to send the former President out on the stump. I almost feel bad for Jeanine...this'll be brutal.<br /><br />Speaking of the former president, his Secretary of Energy, Gov. Bill Richardson (D-NM), is the subject of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/politics/la-na-richardson14aug14,1,5898623.story?coll=la-news-politics-national&ctrack=1&cset=true">a profile in today's LA Times</a>. The article gives an interesting perspective on Richardson, who likely will end up on Democratic ballots in 2008...not the most flattering perspective, in my mind, but interesting. <br /><br />Ever noticed how Democrats give up secure seats to run for President, while Republicans opt to run for President when they're about to get voted out of their current job? See Gov. Mitt Romney in Massachusetts and, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory?id=1037003&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312">if numbers hold</a>, Sen. Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania. Honestly...<a href="http://www.bobcaseyforpa.com/">Bob Casey</a> is raising a fair amount of money, but at this rate, he won't need it. Between his name recognition and Santorum's determination to sink his own candidacy, Casey might be on his way to a nice promotion: from <a href="http://www.patreasury.org/index.aspx">State Treasurer</a> to US Senator. <br /><br /><b>Obligatory Pop Culture Reference</b>: A few weeks ago, I turned on the radio and, within moments, Destiny's Child's single, "Girl," blaring through my stereo speakers. Somewhere during Kelly Rowland's verse, I felt a smile cross my face...the same smile that crossed my face the first time I heard it, the same smile that crossed my face the 100th time I heard it and the same smile that'll cross my face the next 100 times I hear it. <br /><br />"Girl" is the closest I've ever gotten to hearing Little Brother on the radio (the song was produced by LB's producer extraordinare, 9th Wonder) and everytime, it makes me smile.  I swear, it never gets old.<br /><br />Moments like this are about to become more frequent. In September, Little Brother will drop <i>The Minstrel Show</i>, the highly anticipated follow-up to their critically acclaimed debut, <i>The Listening</i>. The album will be the first major release from the trio since signing to Atlantic Records. The boys will be previewing their new album on an upcoming episode of MTV's <a href="http://www.mtv.com/onair/advance_warning/">Advance Warning</a> (the episode premieres on Monday, August 22). Just a week or so ago, Pooh, Phonte and 9th went to New York City and <a href="http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2005/07/littlebrother_newvideo/">shot their first video</a> for <i>The Minstrel Show's</i> lead single, "Lovin' It."  And, of course, the North Carolina natives will be travelling all across the country with their <a href="http://www.hallofjustus.com/">Hall of Justus</a> brethren (The Away Team, L.E.G.A.C.Y., Joe Scudda, Chaudon and Darien Brockington). <br /><br />They might be rappers and I might just be a pseudo-politico, but we're cut from the same cloth...and somehow, the fact that they made it, just gives me hope. Really, I'm just super-proud. <br /><br /><center><img src="http://77e.org/wp-content/minstrelcover.jpg" width="300" height="300" /><br /><b>IN STORES SEPTEMBER 13TH!!!</b></center><br /><br />Sidenote: The <a href="http://www.atlanticrecords.com/littlebrother/article/?article=33100009">Commercial Free Tour</a> is coming to a city near you: Boulder, Chicago, Baltimore, Boston, Seattle, Carrboro (of course) and...gasp!...Lawrence (KS).
