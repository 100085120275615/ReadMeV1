<div>While McFarland continues her charade that she's a candidate and continues to break the 11th Commandment of the President she worked for, Spencer has stayed on task attacking Mrs. Clinton every chance he gets. His <a href="http://blogs.timesunion.com/capitol/?p=1948">newest ad</a> puts a lovely little picture of the Misses next to a picture of the Iranian President. In this ad he points out a bunch of votes Clinton cast, all of which were opposed to what we need in terms of the Global War on Terror and in the chance that Iran becomes a nuclear threat, which grows greater by the day.<br />
<br />Spencer may shoot from the mouth, but he does so with style and continually stays on topic. This is the year of national security, that's why Giuliani has become such a nationwide hero. National security is what Spencer campaigns on -- showing the large gaps inside of Clinton's platform and votes. Continuing to do so is just the right course in a year where we realize that the threat of Iran and the war with Israel by a terrorist force in Lebanon is one which could threaten us as well. Strong leadership is needed and Spencer is showing that this is not what Clinton provides. Keeping this up is exactly what he needs to continue with.<br />
<br />Spencer has also challenged the Senator to a debate. Will she accept? Of course not, she didn't accept the debate with NY1. Spencer didn't comment on the debate, but then again if you are focusing in on Mrs. Clinton, wouldn't you wait until you knew that she would attend such a debate to say you'll attend. He already debated McFarland and showed that he would take the higher ground against <a href="http://t0llenz.blogspot.com/2006/08/liar.html">rude character attacks</a>. Spencer is the candidate to take on Mrs. Clinton. Maybe he can't win -- but he'll do better than any other this year and his ads and actions speak volumes of what he can accomplish against this seemingly unthinkable battle.<br />
