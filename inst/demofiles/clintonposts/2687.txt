<div><p>Back in 2000, Spike Jonze directed this <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2725718">Al Gore campaign video</a>
of Gore relaxing and regrouping with his charming family during &quot;the
period of time formally known as vacation&quot;, before heading out on the
campaign trail &quot;full sprint&quot; until election day.&nbsp; </p>

<p>They go to dinner at his mom's (&quot;Grandma, do you have any advice on
interviewing Dad?&quot;&nbsp; &quot;Yes.&nbsp; Don't do it.&quot;); Tipper reminisces about how
she and Al met (they were 16 and 17, at a prom afterparty... he
was handsome, a little serious-looking, and asked her questions about
herself.&nbsp; &quot;Was I a little stiff?&quot;, he asks.&nbsp; &quot;You weren't stiff at all,
not at all&quot;, she responds with a smooch, &quot;and you know what, you're not
stiff now&quot;... he responds by singing with a twang &quot;I don't have to
speak, 'cause she defends me&quot;); daughter Karenna talks about how she believed in
Santa Claus &quot;way too late&quot; (&quot;Finally, mom was like, &quot;Karenna, actually,
your friends are right.&quot; Al: &quot;This was at 17&quot;); Al talks
about his discomfort with certain aspects of campaigning (Al: &quot;Oh yeah,
I know him.&nbsp; That's the guy who's been standing around motionless
behind the President for the last 8 years&quot;.&nbsp; Daughter Kristen,
chortling: &quot;Were all vice-presidents that motionless?&quot; Al: &quot;No, no... I
did it really well&quot;); gets &quot;interviewed&quot; by Kristen (&quot;Which of us kids
do you like best?&quot;); sings one of his father's campaign jingles (&quot;Vote
for Gore, vote for Gore, he's wise and able and he's just 44&quot;); talks
about his early years (&quot;I was about the most disillusioned person
you've ever encountered, and I thought that the last thing I would do
was politics&quot;) and how covering the government during his 7-year career
as a journalist helped him see politics as a viable, if flawed, route
to making things better; speaks with clarity and commonsense about
education, energy efficiency and the environment; and listens
goodhumoredly as the family ribs him about being a group movie fanatic,
who pauses and rewinds everytime anyone goes to the bathroom (Al:
&quot;That's courtesy!&quot;)</p>

<p>It's incredibly bittersweet, when you consider the tragic consequences of <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2006_05_01_digbysblog_archive.html#114761723605865227">this incompetent bully's</a> occupying Gore's rightful place as president.</p>

<p>Along the same lines: Gore's recent <a href="http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2727144">wonderful SNL performance as Prez</a> and <a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/newyorker/slideshows/040913algore.html">this funny song</a> written by one of Gore's neighbors.</p>

-- He served two terms as vice president under a popular president. He
then lost the presidency in a razor-thin election. After eight years,
he repackaged himself and won the race for the White House and was
re-elected in a major landslide.
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span id="siteCss"><span id="Default3Col"><span id="Article">That person was Richard Nixon. What Nixon did in 1968, Al Gore
could repeat in 2008. Like Nixon, Gore faces a nation divided by an
unpopular war. And like Nixon, Gore could transform anti-war anger and
general public malaise into votes.
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span id="siteCss"><span id="Default3Col"><span id="Article">Moreover, Democrats, moderate Republicans and independents are
eager for a change, and Gore could emerge as a central agent for change
in 2008. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span id="siteCss"><span id="Default3Col"><span id="Article">A number of Americans strongly believe that Gore was unfairly
robbed of the presidency in 2000. Two terms of George W. Bush have
demonstrated that almost every point Gore raised in the 2000 election -
the dangers posed by global warming, the criticality of alternative
fuel sources, the foolishness of tax breaks for the ultra-rich, the
need for international diplomacy and consensus building, prudence in
Supreme Court nominations, and a commitment to civil liberties - were
right on target.
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span id="siteCss"><span id="Default3Col"><span id="Article">Gore has learned the hard way about the extreme right-wing
that now dominates the Republican Party. From being singled out for a
special baggage search and frisking at Reagan National Airport in May
2002 to being one of the first to respond, on his own dime, to the
plight of Hurricane Katrina victims on the Gulf Coast, Gore understands
how the Bush administration and the Republican Party have destroyed the
America in which the vast majority of citizens once believed.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span id="siteCss"><span id="Default3Col"><span id="Article">And that
gives Gore a unique perspective on matters of war and peace, civil
liberties opposed to totalitarian rule, and a caring and
service-oriented government as opposed to a detached bureaucracy only
interested in lining the pockets of big business and political cronies.
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span id="siteCss"><span id="Default3Col"><span id="Article">Statesmanship is an earned attribute, and a Gore presidency
would not require any on-the-job training on domestic or global policy
making. The former vice president would be welcomed by a world eager to
see America once again become a force for diplomacy and human rights
and not a promoter of pre-emptive war and torture flights and secret
gulags.

<p>Forget Hillary.&nbsp; Gore in 2008!!</p></div>
