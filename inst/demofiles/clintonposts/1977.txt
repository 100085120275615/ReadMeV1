<span>Catholic? Rudy Watch</span>
</a>, defends her continued support of Rudy Giuliani for President, in spite of his continued support of abortion and civil unions. It's a very civil debate, and well written too, neither of which you see too often these days. Both debate from a Catholic point of view, which I can sort of understand, being a recovering Catholic (that's like being a recovering alcoholic, only we don't spend the next day trying to remember what we did the night before).<br />
<br />As for me, I'm undecided, but leaning towards the "Just say no to Rudy" camp. Now I don't care about Giuliani's support of civil unions. But abortion (particularly partial-birth abortions) and gun control <b>are</b> two of my hot buttons and Giuliani pushes them both. In fact, the only two things he's got going for him, other than his obvious leadership abilities (which I must admit count for a lot) is that he's not John McCain or Hillary Clinton.<br />
<br />Oh well. Ask me again in two years.<br />
