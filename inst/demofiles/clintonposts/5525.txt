Once again, John F'n Kerry, one half of the famous duo, Cash & Kerry, arose this morning and again changed his mind on the war in Iraq.  Over a month ago, President Bush forced Kerry, aka "Lurch" into stating that even knowing what we do now about the WMD in Iraq, he would have authorized us to go to war.  That's right, for those of you who are keeping track, John F'n Kerry said that he would have made the decision to go to war even with the knowledge that we have now of the existence of WMD in Iraq.<br />At a speech yesterday he stated "Invading Iraq was a crisis of historic proportions and, if we do not change course, there is the prospect of a war with no end in sight." <br />I am waiting for John Kerry to finaly say, "I use to be indecisive.  Now I'm not sure"  This guy changes his mind more often then Jenna Jameson the Porn actress changes her thong.  Is this the guy we want as commander in chief of our armed forces?  He would have our troops in Iraq one day and the next day he would send them home, and 3 days later, send them to the Sudan.  Lurch has absolutely no ability to make a independent decision and then stick to it!  In many places that I have worked in the past, I have discovered more and more that people in charge cannot make up their own decisions and follow thru with that choice.  At least when President George W. Bush makes a decision, he sticks by his guns, even when he has had to make some of the toughest decisions a President should ever have to make, he has not changed course or his mind. <br /><br />I watched Dan Rather make a half hearted attempt at apologizing last night on the CBS evening news.  It is my belief, that the only thing that Dan Rather is sorry about, is the fact that he got caught!<br />Now CBS is going to assemble a panel to examine what went wrong with "Memogate"  I cannot wait to see who they put on this panel of "experts".  Hmm, probably Jimmy Carter, James Carville, and hell, even "Babs" herself, Barbara Striesand.  Now that is a non biased panel!......As If!!!<br />I say the way to find out who is behind the fraudulent memos is easy.  Simply follow the money.  In all my days as a hunter, I dreamed of a blood trail as easy as this to follow.  My expert opinion is that the trail ends at Bill and Hillary Clinton's door step.  And let us not forget there close friend and the one who controls the purse strings of the Democratic Party, Yes you got it, Terry McAuliffe aka "McAwful". <br />My theory is that the Clintons (Billary) remember, one in the same person, do not want John F'n Kerry, aka Lurch, to win the election in November because that would interfere with Hillary's chance of making a run for the White House in 2008.  Remember, in 2008 George W. Bush will be a "lame duck" president, and Hillary will not have to chance running against a sitting President.  By helping the Republicans retain the White House in November, Hillary can make a clean, possibly unobstructed run to be the first (GULP) woman President in the USA.  I become sick to my stomach at the mere thought of Hillary as President of our country.<br />The Republicans need to start NOW in finding a capable candidate to run in 2008.  As nice as I think it is that Billary and McAwful are trying to assist President Bush in his bid for reelection, I would rather they stay out of it. <br />Watch out Lurch, Billary isn't the friend you think they are.  Remember, that kind of friendship has a huge price tag attached.  Lives have been lost and people have gone to prison and had there reputations tarnished defending Billary.  I don't think it is in Hillary's best interest that John F'n Kerry become the next president of the United States of America.  Not in our best interest either for that matter.  America is safer under the leadership of President George W. Bush.<br /><br />G-d Bless The USA, and G-d Bless President George W. Bush!<br />Let Freedom Ring!<br />
