In an announcement last week the UN tried to shake the US down for more than the <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=564&ncid=564&e=6&u=/nm/20050815/ts_nm/food_southern_africa_dc_2">52 million</a> it has already given to alleviate hunger in Africa. Kenyan economist James Shikwati has been pleading with the West that this kind of aid is the <a href="http://service.spiegel.de/cache/international/spiegel/0,1518,363663,00.html">worst thing for Africa</a>, but it is falling on deaf ears at the UN. In it's heyday, <a href="http://diplomadic.blogspot.com/2005/01/more-unhonesty.html">The Diplomad</a> did a great job documenting what a UN "relief effort" looks like (for a priceless portrait of what happens when their "assessment teams" hit the ground, drill down to the earlier links).It would be interesting to see an audit of how the money pledged to the tsunami effort was spent, based on The Diplomad's analysis of the effort. The <a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=14000">Food for Oil scandal</a> certainly highlighted how ethically challenged the accounting and disclosure practices are at the UN. Of course warning signs of these problems were evident long before this story broke:<br /><br /><blockquote>[T]he Clinton Administration fired our top budget analyst at the U.N., Linda Shenwick, because she was telling Congress about U.N. corruption. Without Shenwick in place, there is still no effective way to monitor where our money is going. Some members of Congress, including Senator Charles Grassley and Congressmen Cliff Stearns and Roscoe Bartlett, have spoken out on Shenwick's behalf, but progress in getting her returned to her job has been slow. She has been out of her job for 18 months.<br /><br />      "The United Nations has very, very shoddy management practices," Shenwick told a recent AIM conference on whistleblowers. After going to her superiors with this information, she said, they confirmed it but insisted that she not share it with Congress. Shenwick was told by one official at the U.S. Mission to the U.N. that telling the truth about U.N. mismanagement didn't serve the interests of the Clinton Administration. After receiving a series of outstanding performance evaluations, she got an unsatisfactory evaluation as retaliation for her truth-telling. U.S. officials even tried to move Shenwick to a job in Virginia unrelated to her expertise.<br /><br />      She said the U.N. itself doesn't want to identify and change the way it does business. This behavior was encouraged by the Clinton Administration. As early as 1995, the administration knew that U.N. troops being sent into Africa and Asia as peacekeepers were spreading AIDS. "They did nothing to deal with that problem," she said. "They only recognized and began talking about the problem one year ago" in early 2000. She said that when then-U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright briefed her senior team at the mission about the problem, Albright told them, "Don't go out of the room with this." <br /><br />      Noting that the U.N. is spending millions of dollars supposedly to fight the AIDS epidemic, Shenwick said one solution might be for the U.N. to stop sending AIDS-infected soldiers around the world. She added that, "Our troops that served with them were put at risk" and that "The United Nations is probably responsible for introducing AIDS into Cambodia." Indeed, a documentary making this claim has been produced by a group in Sweden. </blockquote><br /><br />From sexual abuses in the <a href="http://www.thebcobserver.com/(uqnyzh45f42mte3iwigohdqs)/Article.aspx?ArticleID=642&IssueID=18">Congo</a> to it's cover-up and possible complicity on the <a href="http://lastofthefamous.blogspot.com/2004_04_04_lastofthefamous_archive.html#108140663004132701">Rwanda massacres</a>, these accounts of the UN's activities in Africa complete a portrait that was sketched out in Parts <a href="http://ijpublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2005/08/uns-war-on-poor.html">One</a> and <a href="http://ijpublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2005/08/uns-war-on-poor-part-ii.html">Two</a> of this series. What emerges is an cynical organization that is committed to depopulating the planet, creating it's proxy rule over entire continents by it's racketeering with corrupt dictators, which seek to create an ectopia for an elite few. Granted there are no doubt still principled persons involved which that organization, and it would be truly appalling if an organization that large and well funded did absolutely no good at all. But increasingly global populations deemed "underdeveloped" have been targeted by the UN under an agenda referred to as "<a href="http://www.womensgroup.org/SUSD.html">sustainable development</a>". <br /><br /><blockquote>Sustainable development is economic--who would have ever thought that there was a possibility that the air we breathe and the water we drink would be measured by a global body and that our use could then be measured according to how much we produce (or how we think), a Marxist/Leninist concept. Production and consumption are at the heart of sustainable development--if you don't produce, you don't consume. When we ask ourselves who cannot produce, the answer is babies and toddlers as well as the elderly. Do we wonder why there is an upward trend in abortion and euthanasia? A women who is not pregnant and who has a limited number of children can produce more for the state than the woman who has three children. In addition, welfare is not sustainable as those living off of it are not producing.</blockquote> <br /><br />This concept is being used to justify the overriding of any number of traditional notions, such as beliefs in God, ethics, free enterprise, and even national sovereignty. Maurice Strong at the Gorbachev State of the World Forum puts it this way: <br /><br /><blockquote>I will not attempt a definitional discussion on sustainable development. We want to put it in business terms. We have Earth, Inc. with depreciation, amortization and maintenance accounts so that you are not living off of capital. If we continue to equate wealth creation with the liquidation of our natural capital, we will be headed for bankruptcy and that is the direction we are going now. We need all the elements you mentioned and more to bring the ecological systems and behavior towards them in line with our economic and social aspirations. Those things have to be brought into a new balance if we are going to enjoy a sustainable way of life on our planet. (emphasis added)</blockquote><br /><br />Charles Wolfenson of the World Bank called it a "first attempt at an international accounting." For the sake of those living in underdeveloped nations, lets hope the UN's implementation fails. We've seen how bad they are at accounting.
