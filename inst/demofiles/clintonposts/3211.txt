<div>I think the most important stat is on the bottom, even democrats believe this is hurting troop morale.  Nothing like supporting the troops huh liberals?  Oh well, this should make 2006 and 2008 easier.<br />

<br />Democratic Senators who say they support the troops continue to undermine their mission with harsh attacks on the Iraq war - even after a poll released over the weekend showed that more than two-thirds of Americans believe they're hurting troop morale.<br />
<br />"What's happening [in Iraq] is not working; it's a disaster," Sen. Barbara Boxer complained Tuesday - oblivious to the damage her comments would do. "Right now, there's an endless war," she declared.<br />
<br />Reacting to President Bush's Iraq war speech Wednesday morning, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid griped that all he heard was the "recycled [and] tired rhetoric of âstay the course.â <br />
<br />"Simply staying the course is no longer an option, we must change the course. We can do better," Reid groused.<br />
<br />Hours earlier, Sen. Hillary Clinton complained that she was tricked into voting to authorize the Iraq war when the White House gave her "false" intelligence on Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.<br />"Based on the information that we have today, Congress never would have been asked to give the President authority to use force against Iraq," she chided.<br />
<br />The anti-war showboating by top Democrats continues despite the findings of an RT Strategies poll released over the weekend, which showed that 70 percent of Americans believe that Iraq war criticism by Democratic Senators is hurting troop morale.<br />
<br />A full 44 percent said the Senatorial complainers had hurt the troops "a lot." <br />
<br />Even self-identified Democrats agreed that their Senators were damaging the war effort, with 55 percent saying their criticism hurts the troops - and just 21 percent saying it helps. </em>
