<div>Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold will <a href="http://www.wispolitics.com/index.iml?Content=174">be in Iowa next week</a>, home to the first-in-the-nation presidential caucus. He has expressed interest in running for the Democratic nomination and appears to be getting more serious about it as his anti-war stance gains traction.<br />
<br />Feingold could be the Howard Dean of 2008. He has opposed the war from the start and was the first senator to propose setting a timeline for withdrawal. Given that most of the potential candidates (Hillary, Kerry, Edwards, Biden) voted in favor of the war , Feingold has a chance to stand out--especially if Al Gore does not run.<br />
