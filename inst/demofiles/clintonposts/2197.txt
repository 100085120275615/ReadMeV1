</a>A U.S. Marine squad was marching north of Falullah when they came upon an Iraqi terrorist, badly injured and unconscious.  On the opposite side of the road was an American Marine in a similar but less serious state.  The Marine was conscious and alert and as first aid was given to both men, the squad leader asked the injured Marine what had happened.<br />
<br />The Marine reported, "I was heavily armed and moving north along the highway here, and coming south was a heavily armed insurgent.  We saw each other and both of us took cover in the ditches along the road.<br />
<br />"I yelled to him that Saddam Hussein is a miserable, lowlife scumbag, and he yelled back that Senator Ted Kennedy is a good-for-nothing, fat, left-wing liberal drunk.  So I said Osama Bin Laden dresses and acts like a frigid, mean-spirited lesbian.  He retaliated by yelling, 'Oh, yeah?  Well, so does Mrs. Clinton.'<br />
<br />"So, we were in the middle of the road, shaking hands, when a truck hit us."<br />

<br />A freshman on his way to Podunk U. is enjoying his first airplane ride.  But they had been aloft only a few minutes when he complained to the steward that his ears were popping.<br />
<br />The attendant smiled and gave the freshman some chewing gum, assuring him that many people experienced the same discomfort.<br />
<br />When they landed, the freshman thanked the steward, and then asked:  "The chewing gum worked fine, but how do I get it out of my ears?"<br />
