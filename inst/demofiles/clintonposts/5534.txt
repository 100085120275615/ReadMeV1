Our climb teams come and go, they are formed and disbanded, but we always reconnect.<br />Sometimes, former teammates regroup for another adventure, some become climbing partners and friends. Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became best buddies, and so are other climbers.<br />And so we try to stay in touch to keep the intangible aspects of the team. Besides, there's a lot to learn and experience when we walk across other cultures.<br /><br />So, where are my former team mates now?<br /><em>pake ko</em>, hahaha.<br /><br />___________________<br /><br /><span><em>Magnus' response after seeing my Cho Oyu photo album.. Magnus is the Swede, who summit-ed Aconcagua with me.<br /></em></span>"Thank you very much for sharing the pics. My stomach almost turned upside<br />down, I want to be there right now. Can't wait. Cho Oyu is still in my plans for 2007. I want to go to Denali 2006 but I think I will get problem with the money. Just found a job in England but everything is so expensive so it's difficult to save anything here.<br />stay in touch.<br />/Magnus"<br />____________________<br /><br />Cho Oyu 2005 team: Mike (South Africa), Dirk (Germany), Pete (Australia)<br /><br /><em><span>Mike's first report from his hometown (3wks after the climb).

He is the strongest member of our team, and he's going for more difficult mountains. He is an ice climber and a climb instructor in d Alps.</span></em><br /><br />"Nice to hear from you. I am not sure which one I am going for (Dhaulagiri or Lhotse). We will see, because itÂ´s a question of money and of course if I can get vacation or not. But I really want.<br />Let me know when you are in Khatmandu. I will be there.<br />See you Dirk"<br /><em><span>(Note: Lhotse, 4th highest, is the twin-brother-peak of Everest, they share the same south route until Camp3, but it's all-hell to Lhotse peak from there on).</span></em><br />__________________<br /><br /><em><span>Pete after giving his (post-climb) speech to 700 people. He climbed Cho Oyu for a Cause, supporting 'Beyond Blue' foundation - it's an awareness campaign on depression illness now common in Australia. He's the 20th Australian to hv climbed Cho Oyu. </span></em><br /><br />"G'day mate!! Great to hear from you. Ok, I will get the One shot DVD to you. Hey mate, I gave that speech last night and you got quite a few mentions, particularly your feat at being the first ever in the Philippines to climb above 8000 and summit. Everyone was pretty blown away.<br />Talk soon,<br />Pete"<br /><span>His girlfriend booked a Hawaii trip for the 2 of them next summer, conflicting with his floating plan to climb Everest. Hawaii vs Everest.. ummm he's a surfer-dude so i guess it's easy to decide :)<br />(Note: 'One Shot' is the name we gave to our expedition team, since we have the lazy attitude of just going up (one shot) without too much up-&-down acclimatization). We finished ahead vs other teams. It's also the favorite expression of our Sirdar-Sherpa; applicable to climbing, to drinking liquor, etc.)</span><br />_________________<br /><br /><em><span>Fenton (Irish) of Elbrus Expedition team, after hearing the good news of my Cho Oyu climb. We were in Aconcagua the same season, but his route proved to be more challenging due to relentless storms (his team aborted). He summit-ed Elbrus, but got stuck w/ his 7000m peak goal (Acon).</span></em><br /><br />Well done! Great news. We are off to Aconcagua again in Jan with Andy that was on Elbrus with us. hopefully the mountain will be kind to us. If that works ok then Mc Kinley in May. <br />What was the top like on Aconcagua was the last section difficult? Any info you can give us will be a help<br />Regards<br />Fenton<br /><br /><em>Too bad though that I've lost contact with my other, long-ago expedition group mates ;(</em>
