<div><p>Every week or two, someone writes me to ask about fictionalizing a real story involving real people. Can they do it, they ask, and will they get sued?</p>

<p>The answers are yes, but don't; and maybe. </p>

<p>All fiction is autobiographical in some way. Some of us just make up the dialogue we can't remember verbatim (we're not all Truman Capotes, after all), and change the names. This is the basic <em>roman a clef</em>, the novel with a key. Hemingway and Fitzgerald couldn't have written a paragraph without swiping the events of their own lives and those of their friends and enemies.</p><p>But you get into huge technical and ethical problems: even if the events and people are worth writing about, you've got to lie about them to make them more effective in fictional terms. And if you've got to lie, why not lie on a more ambitious scale and maybe discover a real truth in your fiction?</p>

<p>Could you be sued? Sure, if only for invasion of privacy, and maybe for libel. Don't expect to be protected by that line in the front matter: "Any resemblance to real persons, alive or dead, is purely coincidental." Your ex-girlfriend will hang you out to dry...assuming the novel you wrote about her is good enough to publish. Your contract will include a clause about not defaming anyone, so if she does sue you, your publisher will probably sue you too.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, some writers get away with it. A case in point is Paul Theroux in his latest novel, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0618418865/qid=1142139234/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/103-3751697-1671000?s=books&v=glance&n=283155"><em>Blinding Light</em></a>. I'm still just halfway through it, but I urge you to put down that junk SF novel or <em>The Da Vinci Code</em>, and read this instead.</p>

<p>Theroux has been writing and publishing for 40 yearsânovels, articles, and travel books. It's clear that a lot of his fiction comes from his own experiences as an expatriate and a traveller. Sometimes, as in <em>My Secret Life</em>, he teases us with what sounds like his own sexual adventures in Africa and elsewhere.</p>

<p>In this novel, he gives us a hero whose one book, a travel item, has been so successful that it's even spun off its own line of travel clothes and accessories. Since then, the guy has been trying to write a novel for 20 years, without success. In some desperation, he goes on a trip to Ecuador, a drug tour, and the drugs he takes change his life.</p>

<p>Returning to the US, our hero happily accepts blindness as the price of omniscience. Like the blind sages of ancient Greece, the guy sees what the rest of us can't...and starts dictating a novel about it.</p>

<p>About halfway through, Theroux offers an amazing set pieceâa long passage that doesn't really advance the plot, but offers us a virtuoso display of talent. Our hero is invited to a summer clambake on Martha's Vineyard, where his blindness amazes and concerns all the guests. They include the novelist William Styron, Walter Cronkite and his wife, and Bill and Hillary Clinton. Our hero sees Clinton's anxiety over Monica (he knows it's about a girl, but not who it is), and is sitting beside the president when news arrives that Princess Diana has been killed. </p>

<p>This is (at least so far) a heavily satirical and ironic novel; Theroux is poking as much fun at himself as at everyone else. A little earlier in the story, his hero exposes all the secrets of five unpleasant fellow-travellers, revealed thanks to the mysterious drugs he's taken. He is literally an omniscient author, and apprentice writers should be frantically taking notes while reading this novel. </p>

<p>Theroux also breaks rules about point of view and exposition. For the most part, the POV is that of his hero, but at unexpected times it suddenly shifts to his girlfriend. And while Theroux can dramatize his points as well as anyone, he often chooses to tell, not show. Well, an old pro can get away with such stunts, but kids, don't try it at home.</p>

<p>Some successful writers just transcribe what their inner authors dictate, and have no idea whether it's any good. Paul Theroux thinks about the act of the writing, and the attitude of the writer, and makes that an important part of his storytelling. Maybe it's autobiographical, but he stands back far enough from himself to give us all a useful and ironic perspective on what writing is all about.</p></div>
