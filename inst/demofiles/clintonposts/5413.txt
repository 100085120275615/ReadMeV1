Imagine my shock and disbelief as I thumbed through the USA Today (Tuesday, 2-21) and came across this ad:<br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7271/511/1600/commander.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7271/511/320/commander.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br />I literally fell off of the toilet laughing in disbelief (yes I do most of my reading on the can). What kind of freaks would waste the thousands and thousands of dollars that this ad cost? I'll bet that it never occurred to most logical thinking individuals who have viewed the ABC drama <span>Commander-In-Chief</span> that itâs a left-wing conspiracy, a full-blown cabal of Bill and Hillary worshiping Hollywood types bent on getting them back into the White House-Who Knew? As if that would be so bad, remember back when we had peace and prosperity and our biggest concern was a lie about a consensual blowjob. Not a lie about a war that has killed thousands, mind you. These Clinton paranoid freaks are unbelievable. They scream at us on the Left as being nothing but a bunch of Bush haters, which I am. I hate Bush for what he has done and is doing to this country. Check out this cultish worship site of clap-trap platitudes<a href="http://www.goppresident.org/">The Presidential Coalition</a><br />Here is their grand introduction<br /><blockquote>The Presidential Coalition exists to educate the American public of the value of having principled conservative Republican leadership at all levels of government. From Lincoln to Reagan to George W. Bush, principled Republican Presidents have displayed the courage and wisdom necessary to guide our nation during some of our greatest and most difficult times. Their leadership has stood the test of time and made America great. These principled Republicans are the ideal role models for America's future leaders.</blockquote><br />Putting Bush in the same company, with Reagan and Bush is a real reach.  Calling Bush  a "principled Conservative Republican leader," is even a bigger leap. Bush isn't a Conservative; he's a spoiled rich boy playing pResident and spending money like a drunken sailor, running our debt up and up and up. Something tells me that Reagan wouldn't approve of Bush's brand of fascist conservatism.  And don't getting me started on putting Bush in the same ballpark with Lincoln. Lincoln freed the slaves, and Bush ignored many of their ancestors in the South while they were drowned and left to rot at the hands of this pathetic administration.
