<div>The media has been gangbusters over Hillary Clinton even before the freshman Senator was the <em>other</em> woman. Now they have created an a priori sensationalist ideation of her Presidency. You see there are three ways liberals view Hillary: those who wish her to be President, those who know she wishes she were President (and lots of other things), and those who already think she IS President! The conservatives, however, know that she never was nor will she ever be President.<br />
<br />Yet the Clinton brand is still alive (at 60) and raising money. And Hillary is still alive and shrieking. Though seldom together, the twosome have enormous liberal earnings potential. But the truth is HillPAC is a glass-bottom boat. Nostradumbass predicts that this money pit is going to raise record funding from liberals everywhere only to find that the voters don't identify with her in the end. In the interim, however, liberals have been conducting their own pilot tests. Commander in Chief - cancelled. And this new TIME magazine isn't going to sell much more than any other (this is her 10th cover). My free advice is that the Dumbacrats would be far better off if they chose someone more moderate and more male (though I bet Hillary packs a mean punch). Unfortunately, no such thing exists in their party and even the half reasonable members (i.e. Lieberman) are being ostracized.<br />
<br />Observe my imitation of the media, "Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary Hillary." Now, had that not been sarcastic, that could have been an audition for CNN and I would soon be famous. Turn the page already.<br />
<br />In the end, all the TIME magazines in the world couldn't help her and this frenzy will have all been for not. Ann Coulter said this one best, "her first name will help her, but her last name..." Turn the page.</div>
