<br />All of my family is in Texas, although we are pretty spread out. I grew up in tiny Blue Ridge with my mom and stepdad (who is Dad to me), and my little sister Hillary. Hillary is now in her last semester at Texas State University in San Marcos - I am so proud of her! My other Dad and my stepmom Susie live in Huffman, near Houston, with my little brother Matthew. Matt is extremely musical - clearly he got all the talent genes! He's in high school. I'm hoping he'll want to go to college somewhere close to Dallas so we can hang out more. I also have an older sister, Tiffany, who lives in Spring with my awesome brother-in-law Roque (pronounced Rocky) and my nieces and nephew. I got to spend some time with them over the holidays. Her 2 oldest, Cameron and Cassen, are teenagers now and it blows my mind. Little Jillian is growing up fast too and looks just like her daddy. I also am fortunate enough to have to great grandparents in the Houston area - Pawpaw and Jackie (my paternal grandfather and my stepgrandmother {that sounds weird - she's just Jackie to me!}), and my maternal grandparents, Pawpaw and Grandma. My biological dad's an only child so no uncles or aunts there, although my mom has a brother (Uncle Bub &amp; Aunt Kay) and a sister (Aunt Sharon). I do have several uncles and one fantastic "aunt" through my stepDad... although the ones I'm closest to hereare only a couple of years older than me, so it's funny to consider them an aunt and uncle. I'm hoping they'll come to my house party that I'll be having when I'm settled into the new house, since I don't see them enough.<br />OK, well I am making us late for Flinn's SuperBowl party with this so I'm out! Happy SuperBowl Sunday everyone! And no, I don't particularly care about it. I'm just always up for an excuse to hang out with friends and perhaps a beverage or 2. Lates!</div>
