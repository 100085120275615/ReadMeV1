When I go to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/politics/04assess.html?hp&ex=1136437200&amp;amp;en=bb9f07c897d6c1a7&ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage">this story</a> at The New York Times' Web Site and hover my pointer over the first reference to the dealmaking lobbyist Jack Abramoff, the message that pops up is "more articles about Hillary Rodham Clinton."<br /><br />Is this a mere slip, or someone's two cents?<br /><br />In any event, my money's on the error being caught and fixed by the time I wake up tomorrow.<br />
