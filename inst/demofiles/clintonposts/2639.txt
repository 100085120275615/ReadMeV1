While they are struggling to find Republican speakers that give a shit about people trying to emerge from poverty it is being billed as a bi-partisan effort. The truth is that the Republicans are on the verge of absolutely having their head served on a silver platter at the upcoming mid-term elections, and they better start paying attention to these opportunities. Senator Elizabeth Dole <img src="http://daddyos.scrawlville.com/dole.jpg" alt="dole.jpg" width="113" height="133" /><br />and Senator Olympia Snowe are scheduled to join Hillary and Obama along with diverse religious leaders in examining paths to make ALL of America stronger and better. </p>
