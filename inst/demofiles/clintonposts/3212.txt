<div>I think this is a subject upon which reasonable and wholly rational people may disagree. The most important thing I can add to this debate is that I am saddened that an intensely personal and difficult family matter has become fodder for a national media circus. Even the Shindler family has had to ask the protesters to tone it down, reminding them that the family can and does speak for itself, and that the protestors do not. This is an area into which politicians don't normally venture, and yet it appears that many have become involved for their own gain (or to prevent "political loss of face") .<br />
<br />I believe that both parties are disgustingly using the Schiavo issue for partisan hacking and or gain. And I am sickened by it on both sides of the aisle. The Democrats indicated their willingness to take action by unanimous consent, many of them refusing to vote or speak about their respective consciences. Yet we are all aware that some of them believed that this was a prime example of a Republican government deeply overreaching into private lives. These are people (Senators and Representatives) who are stridently opposed to the regulation of "marriage," or in matters regarding sexuality, believing them to be private things out of which the government should stay. Yet they are apparently comfortable hopping in bed with those who would deem to make legislative life and death decisions that are clearly private family matters. And it appears that a recent alleged "Republican Talking Points Memo," is in fact a fake, perhaps planted by Democratic operatives.<br />
<br />Just in case you think I believe the Republicans fare better on this issue, let me make clear that I do not. The Republicans, like a freight train speeding out of control in reverse towards the inevitable cliff of insanity, are reaching deep into the alleged sanctity of the private family, and legislating completely private matters on behalf of a single individual! Meanwhile, the cry of "small government" lies squealing for mercy, tied to the tracks of the GOP, completely aware of it's rapidly approaching demise. Oh where, oh where have "conservatives" gone?<br />
<br />As for the President's record on the pro-choice / right to life issue, I think you may be correct. This is just an opinion, but perhaps he's not as strident as everyone made him out to be. Remember, personal beliefs on single issues do not mean that those will be central policy pieces of any Administration.<br />
<br />For example, I do believe that President Clinton intended to remove all policies against homosexuality in the military upon taking office. However, faced with the actual political reality of doing so, Clinton did an about face, and left the gay community out to dry. Further, under political pressure, he signed the Defense of Marriage Act. I have heard this referred to as the most openly anti-gay act in American history. Yet, I still think President Clinton believed in what he planned to do. But the military and political realities of the time prevented him from doing so.<br />
<br />And congratulations, while this has long been a bone of contention in the "far right" of the Republican Party, you are the first Democrat I have run across who understands that President Bush, intentionally or not, has been the best friend the pro-choice movement has ever had. During a time when Roe v. Wade is the most vulnerable to being overturned as anytime in its history, and when the public climate has most supported it, President Bush has not pushed the issue as many Democrats feared he would. The fundamental "right to choose" has been safe from all but rhetoric during President Bush's term. Agree with the rhetoric or not, factually it's true.<br />
<br />Out of each of life's seemingly insane situations, some good must arise. This is no exception. Out of the Schiavo / Shindler family public spectacle comes awareness of an important issue. We are a society that does not believe in facing death. We let it come, and we are unprepared for it's vagaries. It's almost as if we didn't know it was coming. But in the last two weeks, the Shindlers and Schiavos have given us the gift of awareness. It's hard to imagine being unaware of the potential consequences of lack of planning.<br />
<br />If you are an adult in the United States, the odds are that you are now aware of your responsibility to plan for all eventualities and to have a "health directive" on file so that your family and loved ones know your wishes. It's called "personal responsibility," and though it now seems somewhat out of style, it's the bedrock upon which this nation was built.<br />
<br />The American Bar Association offers free forms and provides online resources available at <a href="http://www.ABALawInfo.com.">their website</a>. It's a good starting place. Be responsible. There are people who love you that might appreciate it someday.<br />
<br />I hope your Easter (however you celebrate, or even if you don't) was as filled with love and joy, as mine was.</div>
