<br />While the "Cooler Line" shows Mitt Romney at the top of the pack in Iowa, most observers indicate that the man pictured above is the frontrunner.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/washington/21mccain.html">The New Moscow Times delivered a must-read article today </a>on the McCain Machine and let me tell you friends- the machine is gaudy.<br />
<br />
<span>His still-informal network includes Richard L. Armitage, the former deputy secretary of state; John A. Thain, chief executive of the New York Stock Exchange; and Sig Rogich, who directed the advertising for the 1988 and 1992 presidential campaigns of Mr. Bushâs father.<br />He is reaching out to Christian conservatives, who helped sink his 2000 presidential bid, by enlisting the aid of figures like Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. of Utah and former Senator Dan Coats of Indiana, both of whom have strong evangelical followings. </span>
<br />
<span>
<br />His growing kitchen cabinet spans an array of issues and backgrounds, and includes James Jay Baker, a former lobbyist for the National Rifle Association; Niall Ferguson, a historian at Harvard; and Barry McCaffrey, who was the drug czar under President Bill Clinton.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Among the more prominent members of the Bush team who said they expected to play a role in Mr. McCainâs candidacy, if he chooses to run, are Mark McKinnon, a Texas political media consultant who has worked for Mr. Bush for years; Terry Nelson, political director of the Bush 2004 re-election campaign; Nicolle Wallace, that campaignâs communications director; Wayne L. Berman, a Washington lobbyist, friend of Mr. Bushâs and prolific fund-raiser; and F. Philip Handy, chairman of Jeb Bushâs two races for governor in Florida and a major supporter of the president.</span>
<br />

<br />Someone will have to emerge as the alternative, but only Gov. Romney has lined up an organization that can compare and the longer Rudy waits the more trouble he will be in. How can the McCain machine be overcome? And where will the other pieces fall?<br />
