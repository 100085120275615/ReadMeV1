<p class="MsoNormal">The War on Terror has turned into the Battle AgainstÂ Baby Bottles, BalmexÂ®Â and all other forms of<img title="toothpaste" height="125" alt="toothpaste" src="http://www.rigneygraphics.com/lunchmeat/archive/05-09/toothpaste.jpg" width="125" align="right" /> suspicious moisture. While terrorists and toddlers have more in common than most parents would like to admit, so far the terrorists have been nabbed before they can completely destroy the house. Problem is, the world canât be terror-proofed, but the airline industry seems determined to try. Listen, if body cavity searches are in our future, the terrorists have not only âwon,â theyâre running up the score.</p>
<p>We all cheered when British authorities detained 24 suspects who allegedly plotted to down 10 transatlantic flights bound for the U.S. using combustible liquids and makeshift detonators. Great news! Especially if your seat assignment had you slotted in the middle between two angry-looking Muslims of Pakistani descent.</p>
<p>But before we dislocate our shoulders patting ourselves on the back for this victory against aspiring evildoers, letâs be honest. The security experts on cable news claim weâre âone step aheadâ of the bad guys.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img title="dog" height="157" alt="dog" hspace="8" src="http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0102/012102airlinesecurity.jpg" width="252" align="left" />Oh, really? Not to diminish the sleuthing that led to these arrests, but where did it all begin? With a tip from some neighbor or acquaintance who reported suspicious activity. This ultimately led to the discovery of three terror rings, which were stopped just prior to what would have been Mayhem in Mid-Air. The follow-up was terrific, but the original tip was courtesy Lady Luck, a cheerful gal who tends to dispense her favors arbitrarily.</p>
<p>Weâre told that another terrorist group tried a similar plan that failed more than a decade ago. Yes, we had TEN YEARS to figure out a way to prevent terrorists from bringing liquids with explosive potential onto airplanes. Now that theyâve almost succeeded, the airlines have finally instituted a âno carry-on liquidsâ policy. So we can once again ride in safety with our Fellow Enraged Muslims, or as I like to call them, FEMS.</p>
<p>But wait! Cannot combustible liquids and gels be hidden inside objects that are, <img title="super" height="194" alt="super" hspace="8" src="http://www.supermanhomepage.com/images/action-figures/JLA-FigureGiftSet.jpg" width="163" align="right" />technically, solids? Such as books, hairbrush handles, snack boxes, cosmetic cases or action figures. I assure you, there is enough room inside Supermanâs chest, Homer Simpsonâs Belly, or Darth Vaderâs noggin to hold a generous amount of deadly explosives.</p>
<p>Obviously the airlines may figure this out and will have to ban Solids too, if they are serious about putting a stop to Liquids and Gels. That just leaves Gases. Canât wait until the day we start traveling in a vacuum!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Baby bottles will apparently be permitted as long as mom or dad âtakes a drinkâ in the presence of bemused security officials. Aside from the possibility of concealing a container within a container, will anyone be checking the babyâs diaper? Every drug smuggler on the planet knows thereâs PLENTY of room for handy ZiplocÂ® bags. Ditto an adultâs DependsÂ® so get ready to drop âem, Grandpa!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Â </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><img title="bag" height="100" alt="bag" hspace="8" src="http://www.usdoj.gov/ndic/pubs4/4532/images/photo1.jpg" width="217" align="left" />I wish I were kidding, but doesnât this liquid thing make metal detectors obsolete? The only way to be sure we havenât taped plastic bags to our torsos is either a strip search or a thorough pat-down.</p>
<p>I can see the Cosmopolitan Magazine article now: âForeplay: Whoâs Better, Your Man, or American Airlines.â (Note to American: for a small licensing fee you may use that for your new motto.) Are we going to have to consent to an X-ray or M.R.I. every time we travel? (Note to self: Email Hillary about having Homeland Security head up a National Health Care Plan.)</p>
<p>If we donât implement such strict security measures, weâre basically relying on the laziness of terrorists or our friend Ms. Luck that some future flight wonât be toasted with an explosive cocktail.</p>
<p>Quite a victory for the terrorists: All they have to do is FAIL to blow up a plane, and we do<img title="trash" height="195" alt="trash" src="http://www.cbsnews.com/images/2006/08/10/imagee426d155-3e6d-4828-9fda-dc01e1ad2329.jpg" width="174" align="right" /> a national freak-out and consign several million tubes of lip gloss and Crest Dual Action WhiteningÂ® toothpasteÂ to the trash can.</p>
<p>Remember our previous success against wanna-be shoe bomber Richard Reid? He was not halted by our advanced screening techniques. He was tackled by an alert stewardess with the help of some burly fellow.</p>
<p>And donât think I havenât noticed that these plotters always seem to come from countries that are considered friends of the U.S.: Britain, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia. Have we seen any North Koreans masterminding a terrorist plot? No! The Chinese havenât pulled anything, either. (In spite of their Most Favored Nation status Iâm a Cold War kinda gal and donât particularly consider them âfriends.â)</p>
<p>One interesting aspect of the Lethal Liquids is how apparently simple they are to obtain and use. For example, this recently-foiled plot may have involved GatoradeÂ®, model airplane glue and an IpodÂ®. Childâs play! Other combustibles are hydrogen peroxide (commonly found in bathroom cabinets across America) and acetone (an ingredient in nail polish remover.)</p>
<p>I, personally, am aware of two ordinary household substances we keep right in the garage that can be combines with a certain type of sporting good object to easily blow up a neighborâs car! Of course I will never be sharing this information with my children, much less an angry Muslim, so the secret is safe with me.</p>
<p>This might be a good time to remind everyone that airline travel is INSECURE on many dimensions, and Dangerous Moisture is only one of those aspects. After doing extensive research on this topic for an article last year, I discovered that the national pilotsâ unions think we are no safer than prior to 9/11, and gave a laundry list of reasons why this is so.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples: Even now, airlines are caught loading unscreened baggage into <img title="reid" height="161" alt="reid" src="http://www.terrorists-suck.org/fight/images/shoebomber.gif" width="145" align="right" />cargo holds, X-ray machines of dubious quality, security shortcuts that allow airlines to keep up with heavy passenger loads and fly on time, lack of adequate training for air marshals, screening of baggage is âimprovedâ but does not always detect âexplosives,â cockpit doors are reinforced but this is not a requirement for cargo planes or foreign carriers, crew training in security is spotty and no training is provided to cargo personnel, pilots are not on the âneed to knowâ list for threat intelligence, and general (as opposed to commercial) aviation is almost unregulated when it comes to security.</p>
<p>That isnât even to mention how easy it would be for anyone with a shoulder-fired rocket launcher to come within easy firing distance of planes that are landing and taking off at most major U.S. airports. Ever heard of a security perimeter? Those are for walk-on threats or people waving pistols, not shoulder-fired possibilities. Rent a nearby hotel room, KA-BOOM, express check-out.</p>
<p>So prepare for a traveling life of either no carry-on luggage, or no secure sense that the plane will land where itâs supposed to. When it comes to Evil-doing, it seems the terrorists will be Good to the Last Drop. We can put that in our shoes and smoke it.</p>
