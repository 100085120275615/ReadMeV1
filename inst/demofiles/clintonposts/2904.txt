<div>As I have been reporting, sHillary has been making a fein towards the center to win the middle-of-the-roaders. And in doing so she has alienated her Looney Left base. Even in her home state of NY (why they elected this Arkansas swindler in the first place is beyond me) <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/422082p-356248c.html" target="_blank">the Donks are mad at her for giving up their anti-War, hate Bush, socialist agenda.</a>
<br />
<blockquote>Some Manhattan Democratic clubs are launching a backlash against Sen. Hillary Clinton amid some of her recent shifts toward the right. Once a liberal favorite, Clinton is being shunned in her reelection bid by four local Democratic groups furious over her vote in favor of the Iraq war and her newly cozy relationship with conservative media mogul Rupert Murdoch.<br />
<br />"She is not in Arkansas anymore," said Yayoi Tsuchitani, campaign chairwoman of the Village Independent Democrats, which voted this month to back Jonathan Tasini, Clinton's little-known Democratic challenger for her Senate seat.<br />
<br />"This is New York we are dealing with, and the majority of New Yorkers are against the war," Tsuchitani added.<br />
<br />The defections among the activist left of the city's Democratic Party â long considered a loyal chunk of Clinton's political base â suggest that her recent rush to the political middle ground and beyond may exact a price.</blockquote>
<br />I find this highly amusing, the Right knows she is a socialist and won't fall for her fake move towards the center, and now base of Looneys are upset with her because they believe she really has moved towards the center. Which ever way she moves she loses vote, Too Bad, Not Sad.<br />
