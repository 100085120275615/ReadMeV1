<div>The local political campaigns have been slinging mud for the past two months, and the issues at hand are so completely idiotic compared to the actual important things going on in the world.<br />
<br />There are several offices up for grabs.  The governor campaign is between the former leutenant gov who took over when the former gov became the Ag Secretary in Idiot Bush's cabinet.  His opponent is . . . unknown.  I know there is a Democrat running, but have no idea who.  The other canidate who might win on a write in vote is a current Congressman, who won his office because he was the head football coach who had the highest number of wins in college football history.  But he is now saying he doesn't want to win.<br />
<br />The main race is for an open Senate seat.  I think Nebraska has two, but only one is up for re-election right now.  The current Senator is Ben Nelson (D).  He is considered one of the most conservative Democrats in Congress, and Bush has been quoted as saying he can work with Nelson.  Hardly a ringing endorsement in my mind. <br />
<br />His opponent is Ultra-conservative Pete Ricketts.  He is one of the richest men in the state (but will never reach the top as long as Warren Buffett is alive and living in Omaha).  His campaign platform is mostly about keeping the "Kennedy/Clinton Liberal Machine" from taking over the Congress.   He keeps talking about how he wants to bring "Conservative change and Nebraska values" to Congress.  He spouts religious talk, conspiracy theory, and calls himself a "Regan type Republican."<br />
<br />Their television ads of late have been pathetic.  Each one keeps the mud flying.  According to Nelson, Ricketts wants to set up a national sales tax, and adjust some laws so that millionaires pay fewer taxes, but the taxes on about 90+% of Nebraskans would be raised, and that he has challenged his home valuation to lower his property tax (something I think EVERY property owner does).<br />
<br />Ricketts, on the other hand, says that Nelson has voted with his party on several occasions.  (which leads Nelson to say "No I didn't" and back and forth like children)  He also says that Nelson challenged his home valuation. <br />
<br />I'll probably vote for Nelson for two reasons: First, he hasn't caused any major problems in Congress and seems to try to bridge the Dem/Rep split.  And Second, I don't like Ricketts trying to dictate my "values" to me.  I don't agree with ultra-conservative, ultra-christian, right wing bullshit, and will vote to try to keep that idiot out. <br />
<br />Where the hell are the good canidates?</div>
