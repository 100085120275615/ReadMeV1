<span></span><br /><br />What IS the future for the Brand Democratic Party?<br /><br />That depends on what "Is, Is"!!<br /><br />And the momentum of George Lakoff as the Metaphor Magician...or in Piper's Metaphor: "Lakoff as the Language Linux: Political Operating Systems--Metaphors or MetB4s or NetB8s!!"<br /><br /><br />Currently, there are four sub-brand suppliers for the Democratic Party.<br /><br />(1) Democratic Leadership Council (Sen. Joe Lieberman & Friends).<br /><br />The DLCPPIers can be found at <a href="http://www.NDOL.org">www.NDOL.org</a>.<br /><br />I highly recommend Marshall Wittmann's Bull Moose Blog... <a href="http://www.BullMooseBlog.com">www.BullMooseBlog.com</a> ...BUT...the "real" Bull Moose Blog can be found at <a href="http://www.BullMooseRepublicans.com">www.BullMooseRepublicans.com</a> ... and check out my Patron Blog AD there this week!!<br /><br />(2) The Carville-Clintonistas.<br /><br />Unfortunately, former President Bill Clinton and Sen. Hillary Clinton and their FOB&amp;H band try to straddle most issues at most times. At times, Bill-Hill are firmly in the DLC sub-brand. Other times, they are in the (3) camp. This (2) sub-brand subscribes to what I call "Dick Morris Strangulation-Triangulation."<br /><br />(3) The Goreless-Deaniacs-LBJ (aka Kos Kossaks).<br /><br />Reincarnate the "Great" Society as the Great Environmental Society...this sub-brand wants to return to the LBJ Texas roots. The Goreless-Deaniacs think they are "authentic" Dems...and that the DLCers are the false prophets who profit.<br /><br /><br />(4) The Naderite-Green Party.<br /><br />Like it or not, the Green Party will continue to act as a near perfect substitute for the Goreless-Deaniacs. Given their global socio-political presence (and presents), the Greens will be able to entice Dem-voters for decades to come.<br /><br /><br />Update: "All the world, a Metaphor"<br /><br />Before reading and reviewing George Lakoff's works (and to best understand Lakoff's cognition paradigm), I recommend that you read these works in the following order:<br /><br />(1) <strong>If You're So Smart: The Narrative of Economic Expertise</strong> (Donald McCloskey, 1990)<br /><br />From Simile (explicit comparison) to Metaphor (implied comparison), McCloskey provides us the rhetorical tetrad: Logic (Philosopher's Model), Fact (Historian's Model), Story (Literary Writer's Model), and Metaphor (Economist's Model).<br /><br />For Pro-Con Metaphors (Sunflower, Software, Spanglish), see my essay "Diffusion of Con-Fusion: The Birth of a Political Brand."<br /><br />(2) <strong>Images Of Organization</strong> (Gareth Morgan, 1986)<br /><br />If you are satisified with the economist's mind and model of the theory of the firm (organization)...where the firm equals the present value of future cash flows (Period!), then do Not read Morgan.<br /><br />But if you would like 10 or so new metaphors for interpreting and talking about the theory and practice of firms, then read Morgan!<br /><br />(3) <strong>How Customers Think: Essential Insights Into The Mind Of The Market</strong> (Gerald Zaltman, 2003)<br /><br />How do we process information and conceive and express the world? Metaphors Matter...regardless of the roles we humans assume!<br /><br />(4) <strong>Metaphors We Live By</strong> (George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, 2003, revised edition)<br /><br />(5) <strong>Moral Politics: How Liberals And Conservatives Think</strong> (George Lakoff, 2002, second edition)<br /><br />For the Social Conservative sub-brand of Conservatism, Prof. Lakoff is mostly on point (or rather on mind) regarding the Grand Unifying Metaphor (GUM) of "Strict Father."<br /><br />But for the other 5 sub-brands of Conservatism, Lakoff is off...base and out of the ball park!<br /><br />(6) <strong>Don't Think Of An Elephant!: Know Your Values And Frame The Debate</strong> (George Lakoff, November 2004)<br /><br />Howard Dean wrote the Foreward.<br /><br />For more on framing via Metaphors, see <a href="http://www.DemSpeak.com">www.DemSpeak.com</a>.<br /><br />For a liberal critique of Lakoff, see "Wooden Frame: Is George Lakoff Misleading Democrats?"
