<div>Over the years I've had many imaginary conversations with Rush Limbaugh. A few of them have been political in nature, but most of them were just spent negotiating the prices of the black market pharmaceutical products that I distribute.<br />Ol' Rush and I have been through a lot together. There was that time that we almost got caught egging Hillary Clinton's Senate office, and that time when we got so strung out on Oxycontin that we bought 22 crates of loofah sponges on eBay and sent them to Bill O'Reilly's house. Good times...<br />I can remember getting so pissed at those damned liberals when they tried to exploit the fact that Rush had a "problem" with prescription pills. Just 'cause your riding a rainbow-wave of euphoria with a hippo named Zack and smelling colors doesn't mean that your political commentary should be marginalized (Ted Kennedy is still a Senator, isn't he?). And I have no doubt in my mind that those damned commie-faggots will try to exploit Rushie's recent incident at Palm Beach International Airport as well.<br />In case you haven't heard, Limbaugh was caught with a bottle of Viagra at an airport earlier yesterday. The problem? The prescription wasn't in his name?<br />Did he get stopped/checked/searched because he was a celebrity? Probably.<br />Is it possible that he was singled-out because of his admitted prescription drug problem? Maybe.<br />Is that fair? Not really.<br />Does this have anything to do with politics? Probably not, but that won't stop ol' Limp Bizkit from claiming that it does.<br />Will he also try to blame his apparent erectile disfunction on the liberal media? He's Rush Limbaugh. What do you think?<br />My advice to Rush will be to just quit the whole talk-radio gig, and retire to Amsterdam. Because if he returns, he'll inevitably be countered with the your-penis-is-broken argument (no matter how good his point is) in every debate in which he participates. Example:<br />
<strong>Rush</strong>: How can you say that when the Democrats have offered absolutely no alternative ideas to the Republican propositions put forth in House Bill [blah blah blah]!?!<br />
<strong>Some Dude</strong>: Your penis is broken.<br />
<strong>End.of.debate.</strong>
<br />See what I mean? The guy doesn't have a prayer; there's really no way to counter the your-penis-is-broken argument. Unless of course you can use the you're-a-cracked-out-junkie argument...<br />[for the record - I don't really know much about Rush's political ideas, and this isn't a conservative vs. liberal thing]<br />[end transmission]</div>
