I was watching that the Democratic Convention &nbsp;on cable, early in the morning. <br /><br />Using any sort of serious analysis it is utter banal drivel. But of course that's not the point. Its simply there to create images for television. I thought the Labour Party conference was bad - but it makes that gathering seem like a meeting of the great intellectuals of our time. <br /><br />Okay this is the scene I saw last night. A grand hall full of bunting, balloons, cheesy placards distributed by the party machine, cuddly toys, people milling around, cheering, waving, grinning inanely. <br /><br />Okay its a sports events, right? A rock concert? No, its something far more boring. <br /><br />There's a huge wide screen, high above the throng, that occasionally springs into life to spew broadcasts of syrupy party propaganda (bit Orwellian, we won't dwell...) <br /><br />A live band plays too, and people dance. Yes, all about the hall they dance, and wave their flags about. Its fun! <br /><br />Then, an announcement. This is the serious part, apparently. A disembodied voice rumbles around the hall, a female presenter, with a nice soft radio voice announcing the next party apparatchik, or ex-great leader, to extoll the virtues (real or imagined) of John Kerry and John Edwards. The same cliches are recycled each time.  As each speaker approaches the podium, the band plays a musical intro. <br /><br />There's that great re-occuring theme of American politics too - Affordable Healthcare. This issue, ironically, is often debated exclusively by people who can easily afford it anyway. And like Restoring Hope to the American People, it crops up every four years. Nice to know it never goes away. <br /><br />And don't miss the obligatory Hollywood Celebrity Limousine Liberal, last night in the shape of Glenn Close, resplendent in a sort of strange yellowy white colour, not dissimilar to the colour of dental plaque,&nbsp; and about as attractive. <br /><br />Anyway she makes a short, suitably awful speech, and on troop all the female Democratic senators, in those neat little telegenic one colour suits that women politicians often wear. Each gets a big cheer, like in football game, and Hillary comes on last, in a yellow suit, which kinda sticks out a bit. (Tip to the networks: Ditch the close ups - Senator Clinton's make-up is beginning to look rather too obvious.) <br /><br />Then on, relentlessly, to a children's choir of kids all dressed in crisp white, singing some sentimental ditty (mercifully short) and all the senators grin and clap. Thankfully they didn't end up walking down to embrace the unfortunate kids,&nbsp;which presumably would have made even the most stauch of the party faithful throw up. <br /><br />Mind you, I blame myself. I should have thrown up at least ten minutes before that and switched off the TV.
