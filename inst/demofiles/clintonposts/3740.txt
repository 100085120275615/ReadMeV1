<div>What happens when 134 democrats hold a poll?<br />
<blockquote>"Richland County Democrats held the nationâs first straw poll for the 2008 presidential race Wednesday and the surprise winner was U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York."<br />
<br />"Clinton got 44 votes to 34 for Edwards. Virginia Gov. John Warner came in third with 32 votes and U.S. Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware got 24 votes."</blockquote>Um... that would be Gov. Mark Warner, stupid.<br />

<br />Meanwhile, <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2005/Hillary%20Meter.htm">Rasmussen reports</a> that 44% of Americans consider the Beast a liberal and, 33% of Americans view it as a moderate while 7% believe it is politically conservative.  Before the beast launched an effort to moderate perceptions of her political views, 51% believed that liberal was the right label for her political views.<br />
<br />Finally... according to Rasmussen, if the Beast runs for President in 2008, 30% of Americans say they would definitely vote for her and 36% would definitely vote against her.<br />
