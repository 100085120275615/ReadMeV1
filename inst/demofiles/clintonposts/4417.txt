<p>Border Security - including the security of the U.S.- Canadian Border - is one issue all Americans can agree on in the post-9/11 world.  In fact, <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/trail/etc/canada.html"><strong>Al Qaeda&#8217;s Millenium Plot</strong>, successfully foiled by the Clinton Administration, was staged from Canada</a>.  In fact, GOP Senator <a href="http://www.politicstv.com/blog/?cat=62"><strong>Conrad Burns</strong></a> said back in 2001:  &#8220;<em>We in Montana are particularly aware that our nation&#8217;s northern border, despite being the country&#8217;s longest, and most remote, has for many years been considered a lower security risk than our border to the south&#8230;  We cannot afford this kind of vulnerability.&#8221;</em>  So what has Sen. Burns done?</p>
<p>To find out, we took a turn north on out Road Trip and<em> headed for the border</em> &#8212; to the Great White North, that is. Here is a photo of the U.S.-Canada Port of Entry at Ophiem, Montana.<br />

<p>Here&#8217;s what we saw, left to right: <strong>(1) The US Border station;</strong> <strong>(2) The Canadian Border</strong> station, in the distance; <strong>(3) Point of Entry</strong> - at night Border agents <em>&#8220;close&#8221; the border by putting the traffic cones in the foreground across the road;</em> <strong>(4) The &#8220;Border&#8221; itself</strong> &#8212; where the cattle we saw there crossed back and forth between the U.S. and Canada, and presumably terrorists could just as easily.</p>
<p>Evidently Burns, in the five years since he voiced concern about strengthening this border, has been&#8230;  well, been <a href="http://www.politicstv.com/blog/?p=1033">as asleep as he was at his Agriculture Hearing recently</a>.
