<p>In <strong>Opinion Editorials</strong> <em>(&#8221;All the opinions that are fit to print&#8221;</em> &#8212; a project of the <a href="http://www.ff.org" target="_blank">Frontiers of Freedom</a> center-right think tank), <strong>Lee Ellis</strong>, a retired journalist who previously worked for CBS and Gannett, filed his August 8, 2006, <a href="http://www.opinioneditorials.com/guestcontributors/lellis_20060808.html" target="_blank">article</a>, <strong>Candidates for President in 2008&#8211;Who&#8217;s Needed in an Era of Terrorism? </strong>(He must&#8217;ve worked in the days before Dan Rather lowered CBS&#8217; journalistic standards below those of the <em>National Enquirer</em>.) His thesis is that Condi and Newt are the two top contenders for 2008 and that the choice between the two of them is dependent on who the Democratic nominee will be. Namely, if Hillary is nominated by the Democrats, then Condi must be the Republican nominee &#8212; echoing Dick Morris. If anyone else is nominated, then the Republicans should pick Newt. According to Mr. Ellis:</p>
<blockquote><p>While both would make excellent presidents who would be strong leaders, it depends on whom the party of Howard Dean and Ted Kennedy nominate for President. If it chooses Hillary Clinton, then only a smart woman can defeat her. A man will lose! Only Dr Rice can outdo her on TV and, let&#8217;s face it, the 2008 presidency is going to depend on TV debates and interviews&#8230;The media has also proved by its coverage of Hillary&#8217;s 2004 Senate race and TV debates with Rick Lazio, that it will let no man beat her. Many feel strongly that the US needs its first woman President. If Hillary is nominated as the Democrat candidate, expect another Clinton presidency and all it will entail for eight solid years -UNLESS - Dr. Condoleezza Rice is nominated as the Republican choice. Those TV debates will be electrifying and Hillary will go down to defeat but a woman will reign!</p></blockquote>
<p>At least we can agree on half of his hypothesis! The problem with the second half is that Newt, great guy that he is, is not electable in the November, 2008, general election.</p>

<p>The focus on gender and race by the media in 2008 will be unavoidable if there is a female presidential candidate from either party. It will be a &#8220;first&#8221; for the nation, and provide political pundits around the world, and of all political stripes, a bottomless pit of material for their craft. But their focus will be misdirected &#8212; as so often has been the case in recent years. The media&#8217;s &#8220;talking heads&#8221; will discuss such issues as: &#8220;Is America ready for a female president?&#8221; or &#8220;Is America ready for a (fill in the blank) president?&#8221; However, in 2008, you will not find &#8220;a woman&#8221;, or &#8220;female candidate of color,&#8221; or even &#8220;caucasian female candidate that has forgiven lecherous husband his past affairs then lied about it&#8221; on the ballot.<a id="more-155"></a> The American electorate votes for the person, not the category, and frequently not even the political party. In the case of Dr. Rice we are not talking about just, &#8220;any woman,&#8221; or &#8220;any person of color.&#8221; And given her education and experience, no one is going to look upon her as an &#8220;Affirmative Action President&#8221; &#8212; elected because she is black, or a woman, or both. (Except maybe those folks who are still whining about the stolen &#8220;hanging chad&#8221; election of 2000 in South Florida although the <em>Miami Herald </em>&#8211; that well-known stooge of the Republican Party and Karl Rove &#8212; hand counted the ballots and came to the same conclusion as then-Secretary of State Katherine Harris. <em>BUSH WON.</em>)</p>
<p>While media mavens will focus on the superficial issues of gender and race, Condi will be showcasing her ability to deftly handle the press. The American public genuinely enjoys seeing the self-important members of the press &#8212; who compete with corrupt Congressmen and child pornographers for the bottom rung of the respectability ladder &#8212; get outmaneuvered with Dr. Rice&#8217;s intellectual <em>jiu-jitsu</em>. Mr. Ellis&#8217; article highlighted a recent interview that Dr. Rice had with Tim Russert on <em>Meet the Press</em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dr. Rice was on the stand for almost a half hour as Tim Russet acted more like a prosecuting attorney presenting &#8220;evidence&#8221; to the jury in the form of news clippings as he tried to prove, in an accusatory demeanor, that this witness was wrong in the past and was lying now. </p>
<p>Not only did Dr. Rice answer him quickly and directly, she proved his facts and evidence to be wrong. She even caught him in taking some quotes out of context and made a point of it. I have never seen anyone counteract Mr. Russet in such a strong way. Condi knew her facts and was able to deliver them in a believable manner!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well-meaning groups, such as the White House Project (<a href="http://www.thewhitehouseproject.com" target="_blank">WHP</a>), are anxious to see a woman, any woman, occupy the oval office. This is flawed thinking and diminishes the candidacies of those they are trying to support. The <em>only</em> basis for choosing political leaders should be on the basis of their integrity and ability to do the job. When the WHP says, &#8220;Vote for candidate &#8216;X&#8217; because she is a woman;&#8221; they are implying that this candidate should be given &#8220;extra-credit,&#8221; or &#8220;bonus points&#8221; by the voters. In other words, they&#8217;re saying that women cannot complete without special consideration. Handicaps are fine for an afternoon of golf, but not for choosing the President, or any other political office. Think about it, would we ever tolerate the policy of adding five percentage points to the vote totals of every female candidate just because &#8220;By God, it&#8217;s time we have a female president?&#8221; (Note to ACLU: Please don&#8217;t sue us. That was just a hypothetical, rhetorical question. We did not mean to imply, in any fashion, that God should be involved in the electoral process.)</p>
<p>We appreciate Mr. Lee&#8217;s high opinion of Dr. Rice, but we respectfully disagree that she&#8217;s like the fire hose behind a pane of glass labeled &#8220;Break glass in case of Hillary&#8217;s nomination in 2008.&#8221; Granted, she could be the wooden stake that the Republican Party could drive through the heart of Hillary Clinton&#8217;s presidential hopes &#8212; killing them for eternity, never to come back to life again. But like a fire hose, Condi can extinguish the electoral chances of <em>any</em> potential Democrat in 2008 because as we say, &#8220;We&#8217;re not talking about <em>any</em> woman for president in 2008. We&#8217;re talking about Condi Rice!&#8221;</p>
