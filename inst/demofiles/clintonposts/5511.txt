Oh my god, I'm a fucking Princess. Over the week, I've been watching Princesses movies that if you ask me now whether true love in an American highschool really exists? I'd say yes and crumble helplessly into your strong sensous arms. I've been watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0322330/">Freaky Friday</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368933/">Princess Diaries 2</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356470">A Cinderella Story</a>. Oh my god, I'm a Princess! Chris Pine and Char Michael Murray is sooooo cute! *squels*<br /><br />Ahem. It's a little immature, yes. Sometimes, I just need to re-affirm myself that the world does really only revolve around American teenagers and their highschool melodramas filled with first - a sad tragedy, followed by agonizing impossible relationships, and then an exciting climax (usually a fight, or a short realization of self), cooling off finally with happily ever after. And I'm not being sarcastic even. We will only find true love in highschool when we are young and free. College is just another story for another day.<br /><br />So what happens to those who don't find love in highschool? We wither away and die. We work our lonely asses off earning enough to put us through the end of the day, and die. Why? Well, because that's the way the world works! Television have shown us enough of life to tell us that if we do not find true love in highschool, we're doomed. We may eventually end up with someone later in life, and make enough babies to sustain the world population, just so that our kids may have a chance to find true love when they reach the highschool part of their life. I think I just discovered the purpose of life here.<br /><br />Sarcasm/bitchiness/jokes aside. I did enjoy the movies. It's amazing movie makers are able to come up with different movies based on one similar plot. And it's not just for teenage love movies. Asian horror movies are another very good example. This is not sarcasm. I am bewildered. Maybe a long time ago, Hollywood has already discovered and established the golden monkey(bad metaphor, I know) of visual entertainment. Humans like, <ul><li>love movies <li>teenage love movies - teenage audience <li>action packed drama - nothing too smart, or catagorise under 'with nerd appeal' <li> porn - limited target audiences <li>etc.</ul>Then screen writers start spinning their juices for stories that backboned on this list. It never fails. The list, the very foundation of Hollywood. The bible for all commercial moviemakers from all over the world, independant moviemaker excused.<br /><br />Ah, but they are movies anyway. What? You'd think the hero of the movie will always be a highschool football team captain who's hanging out with the wrong cheerleading crowd and has rich parents who get him convertibles for his sixteenth birthday? (btw, the King is getting me a car. An old mini cooper methinks) Or his wronged love interest would always be a nerdy-but-actually-quite-smart-and-beautiful-underneath waitress who accidently bump into him and one day reveal her true self and make him fall helplessly in love with her? And their love for each other know no boundaries and not even a forklift (totally random, I swear) can seperate them for it is only the truest of the truest true love can withstand any challenge faced upon them.? Movies are what make us humans attracted to the superficial aspect of life like flies to bright lights. Maybe we watched them to believe and indulge our sad selves because we know, there ain't no such thing in real life. Maybe when we enter a movie theatre, for that one hour and forty minutes or two hours, we allow our minds to let go the firm and cruel grasp of reality and wander into the beautiful and happy world of make-believe. I'm sure many people have written things like this before. I'm sure I'm not the only <strike>genius</strike> person who thought about this.<br /><br />Again, I enjoyed the movie. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356470">A Cinderella Story</a> almost moved me to tears too when the cheerleader bitch staged that short play to hurt Sam's feelings, and Sam ran home crying. That was sad. Utter cruelty. Princess Diaries 2 was alright. Nothing special, except Chris Pine. They tried to make Julie Andrews sing again, but it was nothing compared to her old movies. Freaky Friday was alright. Jamie Lee Curtis did a great job impersonating a teenager. Some hillarious moments. On another note, I like Lindsay Lohan's new song - Over, which sounds a little like Fly, by Hillary Duff, also, melikey. <br /><br />Right, so this is what I've been up to of late. Watching movies that I've missed. Playing some games. Reading some books. Nothing particularly productive. I like to think that I'm on a vacation after college, but I'm gonna need to start earning some money already. When I got my paycheque for my part time job last month, the King and Queen cut my name off the allowance lists. I'm surviving by my salary which is depleting quite quickly because of my spending habits buying stuff which I think I don't need. Like hair conditioner, lip balm, iPod, toe socks. Oh my god! I AM a fucking princess!
