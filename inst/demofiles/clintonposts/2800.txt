<div><p>The Democratic Leadership Council has proposed the 'American Sucker Initiative'.</p>

<p>They propose stupid ideas like 'Baby Bonds' - giving a $500 savings Bond to every baby born and again at 10 years of age - but only for those people who make less than $75,000 per year. They fucking want to give my tax money to stupid morons who are so irresponsible that they have kids when they can't afford the cost to raise children and they want to give my tax money to illegal aliens who come to this country and have their stupid illegal kids. </p>

<p>I know that Democrats need people to depend on government (i.e. taxpayer bailouts) to keep people continuously electing them to office. I am fucking tired of my tax money going to irresponsible people who make stupid decisions in life. I am fucking tired of the taxes I pay going to rich people like Hillary Clinton, to fund a portion of their election campaigns. If people really believe in the shit Democrats propose, why don't they contribute to those purposes directly rather than campaign contributions to elect people to steal more and more of the taxpayers money.</p>

<p>Their is so much money contributed to Democratic causes in 2004, like in excess of half a billion dollars. And that is money aimed primarily at defeating George Bush. Just think of all that money that could have been used for better causes.</p></div>
