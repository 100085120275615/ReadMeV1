National Journal has a <a href="http://nationaljournal.com/about/njweekly/stories/2005/voteratings/wannabes.htm">list</a> of senators who could be running in 2008. Of course, it's a depressing read, made up mostly of senators who are either (a) unfortunately likely to win or (b) unfortunately likely to get the living hell kicked out of them. The list is predictably lacking in candidates who would be <em>both </em>viable and desirable. I'll provide a list, because knowing the NJ website as I do, the article could move into their subscribers-only section at any time (if you can believe it, a day pass- that's right, a 24 hour pass- costs $25.) I offer no guarantees as to how long the link will work.<br /><br />Here's the list:<br /><br />1) Orrin Hatch is quoted, but NJ doesn't say if he's running in 2008 (it does mention his 2000 attempt.) Even if he were to run, well, he'd be crushed. He may be a good guy, but I just don't see the right wing getting all worked up over him in 2008. After eight years of the same guy, voters will need a reason to vote for the same party for a third term. In '88, that reason was Michael Dukakis, who used to personify everything Americans disliked about East Coast liberalism, until Howard Dean came along. For Republicans to assume such a weak Dem candidate this time around is inadvisable. Therefore, Republicans need someone who the base will rally around, and who will attract swing voters rather than someone who will simply be the non-liberal candidate.<br /><br />2) Bill Frist. Leaving the Senate, apparently, after '06. Sorry, but the guy reminds me of Jeff Foxworthy too much to think of him as a serious contender. Not that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000094FFA/qid=1108333912/sr=8-2/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-2649918-4639151?v=glance&s=dvd&amp;n=507846">Blue</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00062IDO2/qid=1108333912/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2649918-4639151?v=glance&s=dvd&amp;n=507846">Collar</a> guys wouldn't make good Presidents, especially <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000TAZHY/qid=1108333998/sr=8-1/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2649918-4639151?v=glance&s=music&amp;n=507846">Ron White</a>. Isn't gonna happen.<br /><br />3) Joe Biden. I agree with Biden on more than I would expect (he is one of the better Dems in the national security area), but he comes across as such a pompus guy on TV that he'd probably wind up making me vote against him merely as a way to remind him that a Senate seat isn't a royal throne.<br /><br />4) John Kerry. Again, not made explicitly clear that he's on the NJ list, but rumor has it that he is, indeed, looking at another run. Voting against Kerry once was fun enough, but the possibility that I get to do it again leaves me really psyched up.<br /><br />5) George Allen's name is mentioned. If I had to run a senator, he'd be the guy.<br /><br />6) Rick Santorum. This guy's so conservative he makes me look like Karl Marx. May be a fine human being, but if the Republicans nominate him, look forward to First Husband Bill Clinton.<br /><br />7) Arlen Specter. Some NJ guy slipped this one into the article for a cheap laugh.<br /><br />8) Lindsey Graham. Heard of him, seen him on TV. Would recognize him if I saw him again. Other than that, I don't know a damn thing about him.<br /><br />9) Chuck Hagel. Hagel strikes me as the type who might make a really good VP candidate.<br /><br />10) John McCain. See my thoughts on Biden above.<br /><br />11) Hillary Clinton. She'll win if the Republicans put up a weak candidate and she doesn't get sabotaged by her own party (always possible).<br /><br />12) Evan Bayh. He voted against Condi. Therefore, he could do nothing to get my vote. Doesn't matter, because the Condi vote was his way of posing as a liberal (he's ever-so-slightly left of dead center), and the DNC bosses will see through that. He won't be nominated. VP, maybe.<br /><br />13) Joe Lieberman. Good man? Yes. Honest? Yes. Solid on Iraq? Yes. Solid on defense issues?Yes. Moderate on domestic issues? Yes. Chance of taking Democratic nomination? Hell no.<br /><br />14) Russ Feingold. Standard-issue Dem. Not gonna happen.<br /><br />15) Sam Brownback. Don't know a lot. From what I can see, a generic Republican. Won't beat Hillary.<br /><br />16) Chris Dodd. Liberal Senate stalwart. Suprisingly powerful speaker, but...no. The whole East Coast liberal thing again. Not a chance.<br /><br />Well, that's the list. Depressed? Me too.<br /><br />But what the hell. At least Kennedy isn't running.<br /><br />Yet.
