<p><strong>brecht:&nbsp; roll over bob shrum, and tell james carville the news</strong></p>

<p>Connecticut extremists, rise up! If Lamont wins, your new Senatorial
candidate will have the same wacky, crazy-leftist opinion of the war in
Iraq as ... <em>Chuck Hagel</em>. Wouldn't that be a dream come true for all of us out here on the radical fringe?

</p>

<p>But it's not a done deal, despite what some people are saying.</p>

<p>
A 6% lead in the polls means nothing in primaries, where who actually
shows up to vote is far more important than polls of &quot;probable voters.&quot;
Right now the Democratic Party is &quot;SchrÃ¶dinger's Cat&quot; in the famous
thought-experiment. </p>

<p>You know. That's the one where the cat is neither alive nor dead,
until the behavior of the particle that might kill it is observed. The
Party's in the middle of its own space-time vortex of self-examination
(call it the Lieberman Uncertainty Principle), and will be until the
election's over.</p>

<p>You can make a kooky radical dream come true. You know, the one
where a clean-cut businessman from Greenwich gets nominated - a guy who
agrees with most Americans on issues like war, taxation, and health
care. But this way-out Utopian vision is far from a sure thing. So,
Democrats of Connecticut, make a miracle!</p>

<p>Imagine the new Democratic Party that will then rise from the ashes
of the old. It will be emboldened, visionary, no longer afraid to say
things virtually every American is thinking: This is not a time for tax
cuts to the wealthy. It makes sense to bring our troops home and let
the Iraqis solve their own problems. We need to protect Social Security.</p>

<p>At last Hillary will be able to stop dancing madly whenever the
subject of national security comes up. That would be an act of mercy,
for her and everybody else. (If she can't dance, I want to be part of
your revolution.) Evan Bayh will be able to look for other ways to
prove he's &quot;rightier&quot; than the others. Joe Biden can stop acting so
damned bipolar (about this issue, anyway.) </p>

<p>You can help save the Democratic Party ... or you can turn the page.</p>

<p>The astute reader may recognize that I'm using a variant of Bertolt Brecht's <em>Verfremdungseffekt</em>,
or &quot;alienation effect,&quot; in this post. With the &quot;v-effekt,&quot; Brecht
wanted his audiences to be aware that what they were watching did <em>not</em> reflect the real world. You know, kind of like TV news. </p>

<p>This was part of Brecht's plan for an &quot;epic theatre,&quot; where you
would always be aware you're watching a play. Here, I want you to be
aware you're reading a predigested narrative, not creating one
yourself. This drama won't be neatly resolved <em>by someone else.</em> You - yes, you - have to <em>do something</em>.</p>

<p>I may be mischaracterizing the V-effekt a little, I guess ... in
fact, I probably don't know what the hell I'm talking about. But it's
all to make a point. Brecht wanted his audiences to walk away
dissatisfied, so that they would <em>think </em>- and therefore <em>act </em>- for themselves. </p>

<p>Blogger &quot;audiences&quot; have already written a very satisfactory ending to the Lamont/Lieberman race. But it's not over yet. 6% is <u>nothing </u>in a primary poll. It could go either way. (Did I say that already?)</p>

<p>I'm trying to leave you pro-Lamont CT voters &quot;alienated&quot; and
dissatisfied, so that you'll get off your asses and vote! After that,
hopefully, you'll still be alienated enough to knock on doors and get
others to vote, too. </p>

<p>Is it working yet?</p>

<p><em>V-effect</em> = vote.</p>

<p><em>V-effect</em> = victory.</p>

<p>In closing, I call upon my fellow revolutionaries to take up arms
... er, ballots. To paraphrase those fraudulent Che Guevara diaries, I
wish I were there with you in the belly of the beast! (In my case, that
would be Stamford, CT, where I briefly lived and voted in the 90's.)
The outcome is by no means certain, but the battle is for the heart and
soul of our worldwide revolution.</p>

<p>Radicals of the world (well, Connecticut, anyway) - unite! You have
nothing to lose but your reputations as slaves to the Blogging
Extremists!</p>

<p>Comrades, let us sing our way to victory. All together now: <em>&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Internationale">Debout, les damnÃ©s de la terre/Debout, les forÃ§ats de la faim/La raison tonne en son cratÃ¨re ...&quot;</a></em> (Yeah, that's right. French!)</p>

<p>Imagine ... Democrats voting for someone who supports Democratic
policies - policies most Americans support. I love the smell of
insurrection in the morning, don't you? </p>

<p>Now STOP READING AND GO MAKE HISTORY!</p></div>
