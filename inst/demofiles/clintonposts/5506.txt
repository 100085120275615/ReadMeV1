Notes:<br /><br />1. The graphs look smoothe between August and February; this is because I only did one Chatter Ranking (in December).<br /><br />2. Sen. Hillary Clinton has been taken off the Democrats graph to correct the scale; she is literally off the charts.<br /><br />3. Click on the graphs to get them to open in a new window where they will be big enough to properly view.<br /><br />4. For some reason, numbers are blacked out. Refer back to the <a href="http://globalreview.blogspot.com/2006/04/free-for-all-2008-immigration-card.html">Global Review post</a> for an idea of the scale. The x-axis is months; you can see the break in late 2005 as an area with no 'dots' along the plotted series.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2877/46/1600/Republicans.0.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2877/46/400/Republicans.0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2877/46/1600/Democrats.1.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2877/46/400/Democrats.0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2877/46/1600/Leaders.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2877/46/400/Leaders.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2877/46/1600/Parties.0.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2877/46/400/Parties.0.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>
