<div>This post is a bit late, but better late than never:<br />
<br />According to The New York Times, Israelis, including the "left" have been solidly behind their country's attacks on Lebanon. Steven Erlanger wrote an article on August 9 stating this. He quoted people from Peace Now and the Meretz Party. He did not mention that "Peace" Now is a group formed by former Israeli army officers. Their raison d'etre is to oppose the Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories--an obstacle to peace, but hardly the only one. Meretz is a left-of-center political party.<br />
<br />"Even the bulk of the Israeli left feels that way [supports the war]. There is no real peace camp in Israel right now, says Yariv Oppenheimer, the secretary general of Peace Now..."<br />
<br />Erlanger's article never mentioned the peace groups Gush Shalom, New Profile, Ta'ayush, Women in Black, Anarchists Against the Wall, the Israeli Communist Party and a bunch of other groups that collectively would more properly be termed "the Israeli left" than Peace Now. These groups held a demonstration against the war in Lebanon, attended by thousands, on August 5 in Tel Aviv (and members of Meretz attended this demonstration). No mention of this in The New York Times. Not one word.<br />
<br />This deliberate failure to recognize dissident voices occurs in domestic political coverage as well. The New York Times has given short shrift to Jonathan Tasini's campaign challenging Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary. The Times ignored Dennis Kucinich's Presidential Campaign in 2004. The Times perpetuates the status quo by giving readers the impression that there is no alternative.<br />
<br />Again--all the news that's fit to print?  Not even close.</div>
