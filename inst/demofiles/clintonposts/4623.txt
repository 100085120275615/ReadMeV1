<p>It was interesting to read in yesterday&rsquo;s Boston Sunday <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/08/27/poll_finds_3_way_tie_in_primary_race/">Globe</a> the poll on the three way race for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. At this point it is virtually a dead heat among Patrick, Reilly and Gabrieli. Most of the TV ads are subtle but sometimes negative. Sometimes I think we learn from the tone of the ads. For instance, I get a good feeling from Gabrieli taking out the garbage and joking with his kids. I get a cold feeling hearing about Patrick being raised by his mother alone in a one bedroom apartment and seeing Senator Obama and President Clinton in the background of his ads. Reilly is a puzzle. He picks a deadbeat as his Lt. Governor candidate, says he is not good at politics, and lives in a middle class Watertown rental. As Jerry Seinfeld would say, &ldquo;What is it with that Reilly?&rdquo; </p><p>I wish we could have candidates running for office who were not millionaires. I&rsquo;d like to send an ordinary person, not a rich aristocrat, to a position of political power. Making millions can mean special competencies, but it makes me jittery. The Kerry Healey crowd has a real problem with the wealth image. I heard her referred to as &ldquo;Olive Oyl&rdquo; on talk radio once, but to me her financial portfolio has her as Marie Antoinette. Apparently her husband can sell something or agree to a merger and they come out of it eight or nine million dollars richer. The fact that her mom was a teacher and her dad a disabled veteran helps offset that image, but it doesn&rsquo;t really do it for me.</p><p>Christy Mihos&rsquo; main claim to fame is as a Big Dig whistle blower. That may not be enough to get him there. On talk radio he comes across like an average Joe trying to make the world a better place. That can&rsquo;t hurt. He, like most of the others, is worth several million dollars.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll make up my mind in the next few weeks. For me, I hope the new governor can relate to ordinary people and has the work ethic of a mule along with a desire to stay governor for as long as the people want.</p>
