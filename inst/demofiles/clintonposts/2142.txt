<span>Seeing an ex is freaky.  Morbid almost.  It's compared to being in a room with a dead body,  you get the heebie jeebies.  When he isn't looking, you peak a good look at him and almost always think to yourself, <em>
<strong>lucky for me I didn't stick with this one eh?</strong>
</em>  Then I carry on in my thoughts, <strong>
<em>His father is better looking than he is, what has he been eating and drinking to give him that gut?  I feel sorry for his wife, that she has to put up with him.  Sorry there Hailey or Hillary, whatever your name is.  Aaargh, and I'd be stuck in this hell hole?  Pull-eez, I'd go CRAZY living here!  Oh man, I hope I don't look as old as he does to people.  He looks like he is 55 years old!  Do I look 55?  Naaaaaaaaaaah, I couldn't look that old.  And man, look what he is driving?  An old van.  Oh poor ex.  I feel sorry for you.  Hope you are having a good life.  You're probably looking at me when I'm not looking thinking the same thing, thank GOD I didn't stick with her</em>. </strong> So we're even inside my head.  It's good to be back home.  In my own house, with my own car, looking at my dear David R.  At this point.  I can't imagine looking at him across the room one day thinking the same thoughts about Mr. current Ex.</span>  </div>
