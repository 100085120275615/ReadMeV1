<div>For the last month or so all we have heard about in the news is how President Bush is spying on Americans for no good reason. Which is completely false. The President has legal rights to protect this country from enemies "both foreign and domestic." That's the oath he took and if that means eavesdropping on people talking to known terrorists from other countries that's okay with me. If you are not talking to terrorists then I don't think the President cares about your phone calls. The Democrats, like always, are upset. They claim that the President has broken the law with the NSA wire taps, yet they forget that their hero, Bill Clinton, ordered wire taps on a much larger scale in a time of peace not war. Besides the hypocrisy and double standard they are once again trying to fool the American public into thinking this is a scandal. It's not, and most Americans agree with the President on this one. Both John Kerry and Hillary Clinton have made statements in the last week or so that basically say the same thing, they think that the NSA wire taps should be done, just not by Bush. They claim they want to do it in a legal way. What they are basically saying is that they want to do it their way. The way I see it is this, if they want it done their way then they should win elections, period. These Democrats always complain that Bush is doing things the wrong way, but offer no solutions to the "problems" that Bush is supposedly causing. If we did things their way we would have Cindy Sheehan as next Supreme Court Justice instead of Samuel Alito. In summation I say to those Democrats that what it their way, this isn't Burger King!!! Win elections like the Republicans have done and then you can do it your way, but until then, stop the crying already.</div>
