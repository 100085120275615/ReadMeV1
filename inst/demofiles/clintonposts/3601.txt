<div>The Jew. Once, upon on a time, not so long ago, Jews championed the left and held close to the 11th commandment--vote Democrat. Why now are so many Jews switching parties? There are three answers and each is more disturbing than the last.<br />
<br />I. Israel-Republicans got AIPAC, AIPAC Brings in the Jews.<br />2. The Gay element- This includes all Social Conservative policies. While many Jews maintain traditional leftisit social views, a disturbing number of them--Reagan Democrats to be sure--maintain traditional standards.<br />3. $$$-The Boomer Jews were among the first to attain upper-middle class. Now that they have the money, they don't want to give it away.<br />4. We Love Big Government-This is something I've always struggled with, but it's true. The Jew it seems has some sort of Federalist tendency. Perhaps this makes sense with Rebbe oriented Culture, but look at the names of Jewish Politicians:<br />
<br />I. Trotzky, Marx, Wolfowitz, Finkman... God Dammit.<br />
<br />The Neocon monster must be stopped! A combination of Government's two worst evils-Big Government and Social Conservatism is not an acceptable Doctrine for American Society.<br />
<br />Kill the Patriot Act.<br />*Oh, and Hillary Clinton as well....</div>
