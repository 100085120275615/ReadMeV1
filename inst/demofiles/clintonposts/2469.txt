<strong>JUST A RANDOM THOUGHT:</strong> I'm not a professional political analyst or anything, but I honestly cannot figure this one out. Why is it that both the Democratic and Republican frontrunners for the 2008 presidential primaries are heaping love onto Bush, even though his approval ratings should make him radioactive? And why are they both huge war hawks, even as the war reaches Vietnam levels of support?<br />
<br />Hillary just offered some <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060510/ap_on_go_co/hillary_clinton_bush;_ylt=AsgtwUKF4GQhL3rtgNcG.5.yFz4D;_ylu=X3oDMTA5aHJvMDdwBHNlYwN5bmNhdA--">warm praise for Bush</a>. And if there was a way to distinguish her stance on Iraq from Bush's, I'd like to know about it.<br />
<br />McCain has been eagerly casting himself as a Bush cultist, even making a pathetic little speech at the Southern Republican Conference a few months ago extolling the wonders of W. He's also arguably the most hawkish man in Congress when it comes to the war, pushing for even more troops and staking out the extreme-right position.<br />
<br />Now I understand that a lot of political positioning goes into running to running for President, and that Hillary wants to appeal to moderates while McCain just wants Jerry Falwell to give him an affectionate pat on the head. But I can't understand for the life of me why the two of them choose to demonstrate their conservative cred by backing Bush and his war. It's like someone wanting to run for president in 1976 spending 1974 defending Nixon and Vietnam. Isn't there a better way for Hillary to pander to moderates and for McCain to pander to right-wing crazies?<br />

<strong>UNBELIEVABLE:</strong> Conservatives are throwing a fit over the possibility that Yale will hire University of Michigan professor Juan Cole, a brilliant and esteemed Middle East analyst (and expert <a href="http://www.juancole.com/">blogger</a>). I've been throwing a fit, too, but that's just because I have a better chance to get into grad school at Michigan than I do at Yale, so the odds of my taking classes with Prof. Cole would significantly decrease if Yale hired him.<br />
<br />Neo-cons mostly hate him because he (gasp) opposes the Iraq war and because he (deeper gasp) occasionally suggests that Palestinians are not animals and are, in fact, human beings. Their new criticism of him? He's not qualified to write about Iraq because <a href="http://phibetacons.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzYxZjVhOTY1NjMzZmFjY2FjNzIyYzczNWM4MTU2N2Q=">he's never been there</a>.<br />
<br />Cole has spent numerous years in the Middle East, conducting research and learning Arabic and Persian. Why hasn't he been to Iraq? Well, gee, I suspect it has something to do with the fact that it wasn't exactly easy for Western researchers to enter Ba'athist Iraq, and it's impossible for them to get any research done in US-occupied anarchic Iraq.<br />

<strong>I'VE BEEN TRYING</strong> to write this op-ed for about three weeks now. HuffPo's Philip Slater took advantage of my procrastination and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/philip-slater/two-addictions-that-cripp_b_20748.html">wrote it for me</a>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever noticed how frantically eager some people are to tell you how hopeless the state of the world is? Point to any tiny progressive victory or corporate concession and they'll rush in to smother your tiny ray of light in dreary counter-examples, as if it were an outbreak of crabgrass threatening their carefully manicured lawn of misery.</p>
<p>Perhaps they think being a wet-blanket demonstrates superior radical understanding--a better analysis. But depression is not intelligence, and hopelessness leads to paralysis. It's the small immediate victories that motivate people to get started and keep going--not distant grandiose fantasies. </p>
<p>...</p>
<p>This addiction to tragedy sabotages people working to create positive changes in the world.</p>
</blockquote>I've been thinking about this a lot lately, specifically in the context of people going off the deep end about Iran. In a larger sense, it amazes how addicted liberals are to doom and gloom. I read numerous liberal blogs every day, and hardly a day passes without a few of them declaring the world is collapsing around us. Don't get me wrong; things are bad under Bush. But the state of the world is quite good now when you compare it to just about any other era, and people generally get more secular and more tolerant all the time and have more opportunities than they ever had before.<br />
<br />So chill. And while you're at it, read the whole op-ed.<br />

<strong>ENCOURAGING DEMOCRACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST:</strong> "(Palestinian) Patients die as doctors run out of <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/israel/Story/0,,1771404,00.html">drugs to treat them</a>."<br />
<br />Israel's recent actions (and US support for them) sends quite a message to Arabs. If you vote for who you like, we will take your money, close the walls around you, and prevent you from having medicine or gasoline. When are people going to realize that the only way to stop terrorism is by drawing Islamists into the political process, so that they don't revert to arms?</div>
