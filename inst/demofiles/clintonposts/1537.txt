<div align="justify"><span><span>Is it possible that our grandparents were correct all along? How many times have we heard âThe more you know, the smarter you get,â or words to this effect? But American culture has evolved to the point where many people think that the less they know (or understand) the better, because existing in a cocoon of ignorance is more comfortable than being very aware of the dangers the lie around us. On the other hand, it may also be true that the more we know, the dumber we get . . . or at least, we arenât really paying attention. If we were paying attention, many of us would be scared to death of the enemies who confront us . . . and many more would rededicate themselves of our own collective defense.<br /><br />Popular democrats, such as Senators Harry Reid, John Kerry, Ted Kennedy, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Representatives Nancy Pelosi, John Conyers, and Jack Murtha would like for us to believe that our problem is really George Bush, not the enemy insurgents who live among us while planning our demise. It is Bushâs mishandling of the war on terror, not the terrorists themselves who present the most serious challenges for Americaâs future. Of course, the logic of this position completely escapes me. I for one believe that Mr. Bush has made some serious mistakes; he is human, after all. But Mr. Bush isnât the enemy of the United States. Our enemy is those who seek the total destruction of western culture, or our complete submission, whichever occurs first.<br /><br />Take the popular opinion among many politicians, both republicans and democrats, that the Arabic word âIslamâ means peace. It does not mean any such thing. The word âIslamâ means, âto surrenderâ to Godâs will. On the face of it, any God-fearing Christian would agree that we should humble ourselves to Godâs will; but that is about as far as any reasonable, thinking person could relate to the Muslim faith. I am an adherent of the belief that God gave us free will so that we can choose good or evil â along with the understanding that we will be held accountable for the choices we make in life. Muslims believe just the opposite.<br /><br />From <a href="http://www.jihadwatch.org/dhimmiwatch/archives/012406.php">Jihad Watch</a> comes this interesting read, which states in part: </span></span></div><div align="justify"><span><span></span></span> </div><div align="justify"><span><span><blockquote><span><span><em>Muslims frequently claim, to obscure the realities of the war against non-Muslims, that "Islam means peace.â The word "Islam" does indeed come from the same three-letter Arabic root (s-l-m) as the word "salaam," peace. "Islam," however, means "submission," not peace. "Peace" in Islam equals submission to the will of Allah through his divine and eternal law, Sharâia. The absence of Sharâia is the absence of peace. Bassam Tibi explains: "First, both sides should acknowledge candidly that although they might use identical terms these mean different things to each of them. The word 'peace,' for example, implies to a Muslim the extension of the Dar al-Islam â or 'House of Islam' â to the entire world," explained Tibi. "This is completely different from the Enlightenment concept of eternal peace that dominates Western thought, a concept developed by Immanuel Kant," an 18th-century philosopher. "Similarly, when Muslims and the Western heirs of the Enlightenment speak of tolerance they have different things in mind. In Islamic terminology, this term implies abiding non-Islamic monotheists, such as Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians, as second-class believers. They are 'dhimmi,' a protected but politically immature minority.â According to Tibi, the quest of converting the entire world to Islam is an immutable fixture of the Muslim worldview. Only if this task is accomplished, if the world has become a "Dar al-Islam," will it also be a "Dar a-Salam," or a house of peace."</em> </span></span></blockquote><br />The reader will note that this is not a new revelation of Islam. In the Thirteenth Century, Ibn Arabi, reputed to have been the most exalted Imam stated, âFreedom is perfect slavery under the will of Allah.â What this means, in effect, is that if we are all slaves to the will of Allah, and the Imams are charged with showing us the correct path, then we are by default also slaves to the Imams. Honestly, this does not surprise me given the well-documented history of the Muslimâs penchant for enslaving others. Remember that colonial era Europeans purchased slaves from Islamic traders, so we can safely conclude that Muslims have been involved in, and profited from slavery, from the 7th Century. Today, they enslave their women and children. Terrorist organizations enslave others through intimidation. They would very much like to enslave Christians and Jews, as well.<br /><br />It is time that those of us who cherish freedom, and who believe that God gives us free choice in determining our own ultimate fate, begin to repudiate the rhetoric imposed upon us by uninformed politicians. This is important because the Muslims who live within our communities have as their ultimate goal, the conquest of all non-Muslims and our enslavement to their way of thinking. If a Muslim is a true believer, he cannot be a moderate thinker. If a Muslim is truly dedicated to Islam, he must actively work toward the subjugation of Christians, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus, and of course, atheists. These âenemy withinâ may have our politicians fooled, including members of the international community embodied in the United Nations â because they are, after all, fools â but they must not be permitted to hoodwink the rest of us. So whenever you hear your elected representative speak about the religion of peace, send them a letter that repudiates such simplistic and false representations. Otherwise, your silence gives consent to such idiocy â and we already have enough idiots living here.<br /></div></span></span>
