<p>Apparently, &#8220;freedom of the press&#8221; is a necessary and integral part of democracy only when the press is parroting right wing propaganda.  But when the press fulfills its duty to the citizens by uncovering Presidential lawbreaking, it&#8217;s akin to treason and should be punished.  Severely.</p>
<p>Yes, the fringe right thinks the <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/showarticle.php?src=http%3A%2F%2Farticle.nationalreview.com%2Fprint%2F%3Fq%3DNDVhYWQzMmQ3YWRlNzFkYjRmZmY4ZTQzZmUwZjJhZj">INYT should be punished</a> for their story the other day about the government having access to tens (hundreds) of thousands ordinary citizens financial records without first obtaining a warrant.  And the administration and their looney, hypocritical supporters are trotting out the usual canard- that its necessary that Bush break any law he damn well pleases because he&#8217;s doing it in the name of &#8220;national security&#8221;.</p>
<p>Apparently, all one has to do to meet the standard of review set by the anti-democracy fringe right is merely state that one is doing this or that illegal, unethical program or policy in the name of protecting the homeland (cue <em>Triumph of the Will </em>footage) and the specifics, the implications and the constitutionality of the governments actions aren&#8217;t really worthy of consideration by anyone other than the very people who are breaking the law.</p>
<p>And are they concerned about Separation of Powers?  Federalism?  Not so much.</p>
<p>I wonder what they will think of the Executive Branch&#8217;s new dictatorial ability to ignore any law he/she wants when, say, the President&#8217;s name is not Bush, but Hillary?
