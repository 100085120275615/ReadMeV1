<div>As I've previously mentioned, Senator Hillary Clinton demonstrated an impressive case of foot-in-mouth disease when she said "âWhen you look at the way the House of Representatives has been run, it has been run like a plantation and you know what I'm talking about...."<br />
<br />Now, anyone with more than two brain cells to rub together can tell that that was an ignorant think to say, especially in an African-American church on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. But, since Hillary said it, I'll play along.<br />

<strong>TOP TEN WAYS THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS COULD BE RUN MORE LIKE A PLANTATION:</strong> </div>
<br />10: Democrats have to pass tests on the Constitution to vote.<br />
<br />9: Senator Kennedy is put in the stocks and given only bread and water (no alcohol, oh the horror) whenever he uses the word "coathanger."<br />
<br />8: Senator Arlen Spector pulls out a bullwhip whenever the Democrats on the committe spend more that five minutes asking one question.<br />
<br />7: Senator Arlen Spector uses the bullwhip whenever a Democrat says "I" or "me" in a question that is supposed to be about Samuel Alito.<br />
<br />6: Sam Alito responds to Senator Kennedy's bloviations by telling him "stop questioning your betters, you worthless drunken murderous lout. And get me some water, I'm thirsty."<br />
<br />5: When a Democrat threatens a filibuster, they are told "You are not to be seen or heard. Now go pick up my dry cleaning."<br />
<br />4: When Congress isn't in session, Democratic Members can be seen repainting the Capitol, mowing the lawn, and shining Dennis Hastert's shoes.<br />
<br />3: "Uppity" Senators like Hillary Clinton are sold to other 'plantations' to be taught a lesson- like North Korea or Cuba.<br />
<br />2: Democrats only count as 3/5 of a person.<br />
<br />And the number one way the U.S. Congress could be more like a plantation is:<br />
<br />1: Democratic Members of Congress constantly try to escape oppression by fleeing north to Canada. Only in this case, no one cares enough to stop them.</div>
