<p>New York Sen. Hillary Clinton is renovating and enlarging her Whitehaven  mansion in Washington, D.C. so she can host even larger fundraisers - in the  property Democrats already refer to as "the White-House-in-waiting."  </p> <p>She is gutting and remodeling the first floor of the home and adding a  1,000-square-foot room on the back, reports the New York Post. The improvements,  which are expected to cost $1 million, include a new raised terrace that will  overlook a quarter-acre of perfectly manicured gardens when the work is finished  in Feb. 2006.<br />
