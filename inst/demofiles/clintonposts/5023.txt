<span>On the Knitting Front...</span><br />We have a finished back, people. Yes, I finished the back to Nothin' but a Shirt. I know, I know...you're thinking, so? Well, this is big because, as you might remember, I knit this sweater before, but had to frog it because it was waaaaayy too small. And I'm so glad I didn't give up on it because I've got gauge still, my knitting is much more consistent, though there are some spots where my knitting is a bit loose, and I'm knitting at a faster pace so it's not taking me as long. It gives me hope that I can tackle <a href="http://www.zephyrstyle.com/catalog/item.cfm/2367447/2628822">this</a> and <br /><a href="http://knitandtonic.typepad.com/knitandtonic/2006/07/sizzle.html">this</a> (um, I'll being wearing a shirt under that, thank you) and get them done quickly because, have you seen the <a href="http://iwpshopinfo.interweave.com/Knits/2006newsletters/iwkfall2006projects.htm">fall preview</a> for Interweave Knits? I want to knit almost everything in there! Man, I have patterns for days! Now if only I had the yarn. I would show you a picture, but apparently I took pictures and they're in iphoto, but they're not showing up as being on my hard drive.<br />Oh, I have a request. I have been carrying my current knitting project in a big ziplock bag because I just don't have anything else that would really do the trick. I want to knit one of those felted bags like over at the Mason-Dixon blog or sew some kind of bag that could hang on my arm, but I don't have time to knit/sew that and the current thing I'm knitting. I really want to use up some yarn I have, even though it's not great yarn. Is there anyone who would be willing to knit or sew a bag for me with some of my yarn I'd send you and I'd pay you what you think it's worth for you to do it? I am really tired of my needles poking through and ripping the ziplock bag and I don't really want to just go buy a bag, although that might be the cheaper route. Just leave a comment or email me if interested.<br /><br /><span>Postcard</span><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2035/1623/1600/000_1993.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2035/1623/320/000_1993.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2035/1623/1600/000_2001.1.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2035/1623/320/000_2001.1.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />I finished a postcard. It's for a friend who has been really good to us and gave us a nice house warming gift when we moved into our new house. I do hope she likes it. I thought about getting a shadow box and framing it, but then I decided to let her do with it what she wanted.<br />On a related note, I've been thinking about creating different things and maybe selling them. Your honest opinion, do you think I could sell postcards like this and like the one's on my sidebar? I also have a few ideas for some stationery, but I'm still toying around. <br /><span><br />In Sports...</span><br />So howcome I was wrong on all three of my sports predictions. Well, they weren't really predictions, more like wants. So France lost, and what was that head butt stuff with Zidane? I played soccer for a long time, my brother played for a long time and now in college, and honestly, I have never seen anything like that before. But I'm happy for Italy. <br />In Wimbledon, I was initially pulling for Rafael Nadal, but then when I started watching and saw that Federer lost to him like four times already this year, I wanted Federer to win. I was disappointed to see Justine Henin-Hardenne lose. But I was happy to see that Tiger Woods seems to be back in form after his father died.<br /><br /><span>Blogs I Read:</span><br /><span>Oldy but a Goody</span><br /><a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/">Wee Wonderfuls</a><br />Hillary has swept craftland with her wonderful softies <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/store/">put together book</a>. She is so incredibly talented, makes some wonderful quilts, has a site about thrifting, <a href="http://www.thriftcraft.com/">ThriftCraft</a> and just seems an all around good person. Even if you've never made a softie before and have no desire to make one, I can almost bet that you'll enjoy looking at her pictures. <br /><br /><span>Newby</span><br /><a href="http://www.worstedwitch.com/">Worsted Witch</a><br />I don't know what the witch part is all about exactly, but this blog seems to initially have started out as a knitting blog and then somewhat abruptly became an amazing resource on all things environmental. Jasmin does a great job of finding environmentally friendly products, researching ways in which we can be better to our environment and I really have to say that this blog has helped me tremendously. She highlights different artists and designers who use recycled or earth friendly products to make their art and she even gives home-made recipes for cleaning products, hair products, etc. Please, go check out Jasmin's blog. I think you'll feel better for it.
