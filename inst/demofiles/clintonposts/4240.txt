<p><em>Not abandoning the foreign policy, just giving it a second glance.</em></p>
<p><em>Time </em>magazineâs June 8th cover-story announced to the world that President Bushâs Cowboy Diplomacy had reached a triumphant halt.  White House correspondent Mike Allen claimed that due to a failed situation in Iraq and a lack of attention to North Korea and Iran, neoconservatism has met its expected demise.  Time asserted that as a result of a poor foreign policy, the Administration has been forced to ditch Cowboy Diplomacy and seek other means of protecting the nation without spreading too thin our troops or engaging the U.S. in battles, wars, and conflicts worldwide.</p>

<p><em>The New York Times</em> emboldened Timeâs argument on August 6th with a piece called âThe Beginning of the End of the Adventureâ pointing to the war raging between Hezbollah and Israel.  âJohn Bolton may insist publicly that there can be not negotiating with a terrorist organization â¦ [but the] Secretary of State sent the opposite message when â¦ she met with Nabih Berri, the Shiite speaker of the Lebanese Parliament and Hezbollahâs unofficial interlocutor with Western governments.â</p>

<p>Pat Buchanan echoed the stories in his July 12th column, âThe End of the Cowboy Era.â  Buchanan explained that âwhat has rendered impotent the robust cowboy diplomacy of George W. Bushâ are limits of power, an understaffed U.S. military, and the curse of nation-building.  He vehemently called for a new foreign policy to âbe imposed to meet a changed worldâ now that the nation is in a âplastic moment.â</p>

<p>These speculations of ending Cowboy Diplomacy now lead supporters of the Bush foreign policy to reconsider whether neoconservatism is the best plan for America during the War on Terror.</p>

<p>Every international plan has its shortcomings.  It seems as if those of neoconservatism numerically outweigh the positives.  However, national interest and security trump any setbacks neoconservatism brings to the foreign policy table.<br />
<strong><br />
Dwindling Public Support</strong></p>

<p>There are three detrimental faults to Cowboy Diplomacy.  Philip H. Gordon, in his essay âThe End of the Bush Revolutionâ in the July/August edition of <em>Foreign Affairs </em>says that a âblind spot in the neoconservative case for democracy promotion and unilateral military action has always been that it overlooks the limits on the American publicâs willingness to tolerate the costs.â  Currently, this appears to be the most obvious shortcoming of Cowboy Diplomacy.  When support for the war in Iraq, the most recent and notable example of broad, interventionist American foreign policy, neared 70 percent, an August 2006 Opinion Research Corporation poll found that the public approval of the war has dwindled to 36 percent.  Other polls taken in 2005 and 2006 found that over the course of just nine months, the publicâs request for troop withdrawal increased 14 percent, from 38 to 52.</p>

<p>It should not come as a shock to any educated citizen that patience is not a virtue held highly in America.  This is seen especially in our current conflicts worldwide.  In a nation not used to seeing war on their nightly news, any solution to ending a global struggle is seen as an acceptable one.  Our previous engagements and hurried withdrawals serve as poignant examples of weak American will to âstay the course.â  The Gulf War lasted one hundred hours and had a boots-on-ground time of less than eight moths.  In Somalia, when two of Americaâs elite were drug through the streets of Mogadishu, abandoning a bloody fight was seen as a tough but wise decision.  Now, with images of Bill Hemmer tracking every movement of Israeli forces and Reuterâs showing graphic images of civilians in Qana, Lebanon, nervousness and fear strengthen the âjust stop the fightingâ mentality among the public.</p>

<p>There is a rough rule that the American public can only stand a war for three years.  In the late 20th century and early 21st century, the length of acceptance has shortened considerably â possibly to less than six months of boots-on-ground and less than a month of heavy fighting.  Any country which typically sees peace in its homeland will not be extensively accepting of a neoconservative foreign policy.<br />
<strong><br />
National Arrogance</strong></p>

<p>The second drawback to neoconservatism is unilateralism.  Once again, as seen with the Iraq war, when the U.S. attempted to rally allies to attack a country posing a threat to it and relatively few others, international support was unsurprisingly low.  International approval, like that of nationâs citizens has sunk.  A BBC World Service/GlobeScan poll in late 2005/early 2006 found that 20 of the 35 countries polled feels that the coalition should pull out.  Nine countries agreed âthey should stay in Iraq until it becomes stable.â  The poll also concluded that 21 countries saw the war as a âmistakeâ and only nine saw it as a âright decision.â</p>

<p>The neoconservative answer to international callings is that when the national interests are at hand, world opinion matters little.  The same international calling for withdrawal includes countries such as Turkey which, according to a 2004 Pew Research Center poll, feels, at 67 percent, that suicide bombings were justifiable.  59 percent considered âviolent actionsâ justifiable against Americans and Westerners in Iraq.  The international lack of support for current American foreign policy also includes Pakistan, which claims, at 61 percent, Post-Hussein Iraq will be âworse off.â</p>

<p>It is important to take into consideration the opinions of allies and potentially supporting nations, especially when touting âwith us or against usâ rhetoric.  However, when the national interest is at the heart of a nationâs foreign policy, the most important concept to focus on is the completion of the mission and national security.</p>

<p><strong>A Massive Force</strong></p>

<p>Finally, when nation-building occurs as a predictable result of a neoconservative foreign policy, there must be enough players on the field to carry out and finish the mission.  The third setback to Cowboy Diplomacy is the necessity of massive quantities of troops ready to stabilize a nation following a victorious battle.  As Pat Buchanan appropriately points out in his âEnd of the Cowboy Eraâ piece, âStong as our military may be, it is but one-tenth of the size of the U.S [sic] forces that conquered Germany and Japan.â   With a troop level hovering near 140,000 in Iraq, violence still rages in torn cities like Baghdad, Ramadi, and Mosul.  As a result, senior generals have boosted the force size in those cities to quell resurging attacks.  As Senator John McCain correctly told in a Congressional testimony of Generals Abizaid and Pace, he worried that âweâre playing a game of whack-a-mole here.  We move troops, it flares up, we move troops there. â¦ Now, weâre going to have to move troops into Baghdad from someplace else [due to the recent increase in violence].â  </p>

<p>Sen. McCainâs statements ring true this third fault of neoconservatism.  Where a national force is needed to strike and maintain an area while keeping peace in an insurgent-filled area, well-trained U.S. troops cannot be traded for arrogant confidence in the townâs people or delusional confidence in the host-nationâs recently built force.  For stability to rise from violence-prone areas, troop levels must maintain at a high, yet realistic level.  So, while neoconservatives like Charles Krauthammer, Bill Kristol, and Fred Barnes beg for increased troop amounts deployed throughout the world, pressure perceivingly begins to build on the actual soldiers carrying out the mission.</p>

<p>The long deployments may be burdensome to troops and family members, yet the mentality of the U.S. armed forces is different from that of the typical American public.  Where the nationâs patience grows thin, the troopsâ support for their mission in Iraq has not suffered the same fate as the civilian public approval.  According to a Stars and Stripes poll taken in late 2005/early 2006, 86 percent of deployed military service-members thought that âfighting [the] war â¦ for Americaâ was âvery worthwhileâ or âsomewhat worthwhile.â  The reason for the high dedication is the American soldierâs unwillingness to quit.  Even after multiple tours in harms way, the typical military answer to a ârough goingâ in Iraq is not to pull out.  âStaying the courseâ and not giving up the fight seems to be the general plan for succeeding among service-members.</p>

<p>Critics of neoconservatism point to a force spread too thin to carry out the presidentâs policy, but the personal morale (last polled âvery highâ or âsomewhat highâ at 88 percent) and excellent leadership forbids troops from quitting when the long haul just seems to be too long for the effort among the general public.</p>

<p><strong>Better Than the Alternative</strong></p>

<p>Although the neoconservative foreign policy has its flaws, the alternate plans to deal with rogue nations, brutal dictators, and terrorist sponsors fall short while engaged in the Global War on Terror.</p>

<p>The previous Clintonian foreign policy, Tomahawk Diplomacy, solved very little and presented an image to Americaâs enemies of weakness and that it would respond to a situation with minimal or no force-to-force encounters.  President Clintonâs Tomahawk Diplomacy relied on the vendetta-powered tomahawk missile to âprovide the explosive oomph to back up his foreign and security policy,â as Bruce W. Nelan wrote in an October 19th 1998 <em>Time </em>article.  Examples of a faultier national security plan, Nelan explains, are when the âU.S. Navy launched about 80 [missiles]â to a result of â[tearing] up some sheds and shacks at a training area in Afghanistan â¦ which might or might not have been producing nerve-gas ingredients.â  He also admits that the attack âdid not severely disrupt the bin Laden operation.â  However, it did â[give] the Administration the appearance of taking action in its war against terrorism.â</p>

<p>Just like the ineffective response to al-Qaeda-destroyed embassies in Africa, the Clintonian response to concerned Iraqi involvement in WMD programs was less than appropriate or realistic.  In 1998, Operation Desert Fox kicked off a four-day aerial bombardment of suspected weapons facilities inside Baghdad, the Republican guard to the south, and an oil refinery in Basra.  As seen now, Clintonâs attempt at preemptive engagement was ineffective, leaving a brutal dictator alive and ruling.  His foreign policy also failed to cease the supposed creation and acquisition of weapons of mass destruction.  The former presidentâs Secretary of Defense said in 2003 that he was âabsolutely convinced that there are weapons [of mass destruction in Iraq.]â  After Saddamâs regime had not fully cooperated with U.N. inspection teams for nearly a decade and Operation Desert Fox had failed to destroy the suspected plans of the Iraqi government to build chemical and biological weapons, very little had changed in the fear of Americaâs retaliation in her enemies.</p>

<p>Neoconservatism may have its downsides, as all foreign policies do.  However, the benefits of engaging in Bushâs Cowboy Diplomacy outweigh the setbacks listed.  The two roots of the policy are its strengths â preemptive force and muscular arrogance.  The first was welcomed following successful operation in Afghanistan.  The neoconservativeâs theory:  Attack the enemy before it attacks you.  For military strategists, this is often the best route taken to prevent casualties in combat.  The second, and most important aspect of neoconservatism, is the appearance of military might.  As famously adopted by President Reagan, showing your enemies you have a force to be reckoned with and you have the will to use your weapons of mass destruction against them serves as an excellent deterrent, especially in todayâs War on Terror.  When placed in a difficult situation, as America is now in a war against radical Islamic extremism, it is sometimes necessary to act in the self-interest of the nation to preserve the way of life and freedom it has so deservingly earned and come accustom to.<br />
