I say <em>rapid</em> because the fronts of the attacks that are happening simultaneously have increased exponentially since the beginning of this new administration and with alarming alacrity. Unfortunately, despite valiant efforts by writers on our side (a very broad aggregation of progressives, liberals, libertarians, and all manner of reasonable observers, i.e. the dispossessed) (see <strong>Thinkers </strong>on this site, et al), the diurnal battles, of which I shall delineate momentarily, are diversions from the utopian agenda of world domination that has been in planning, and now in execution, for over a quarter of a century (remember who was Vice President under Reagan's Administrations) by those whom we now call neo-cons, an innocuous sounding assignation for abject evil. Yesterday's <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-27-2005/0003695653&amp;EDATE="><em>speech</em></a> by President Bush (at the United States Naval Academy Commencement) woke me out of my stupor. Before I outline the details of how we got to this perilous point in history, letâs take a look at the symptomatic diversions that simultaneously illustrate and obfuscate the endemic. </p>

<p>My previous post (see <strong><em><a href="http://n2row-p.typepad.com/erratum/2005/05/_fourberie_hypo.html">Fourberie, Hypocrisy, Bullshit, &amp; Sedition </a></em></strong>within) dealt with the <em>Newsweek</em> debacle and the concomitant actual and documented evidence of <strong><em>Gitmo</em></strong> abuses and offenses (against the Qurâan and otherwise) as a means of diverting attention from such news as the <strong><em><a href="http://downingstreetmemo.com/images/memotext.pdf">Downing Street Memo</a> </em></strong>and the embarrassing (for the U.S. Govt.) issue of <strong><em><a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB153/">Louis Posada Carriles</a></em></strong>. Unfortunately, most of the mediaâs attention, when not obsequiously mired in Jocko, Paris, Idol worship, DeLayâs daily detritus (his maze of illusive culpability is worthy of Daedalus), runaway brides, and other marginalia, has been on the pathetic arm wrestling of the Senate majority and minority culminating in an embarrassing and ineffectual deal, i.e. <em>compromise</em>, of shit-scared, sad old men who now see the Republic sinking. Meanwhile, the <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-05-27-voa28.cfm">Pentagon keeps contradicting itself</a> daily on how often the <em>Qurâan </em>was <a href="http://www.asiantribune.com/show_news.php?id=14569">âmishandledâ</a> or if the <em>Qurâan</em> was mishandled, creating a pile of crap so high of which no reasonable citizen can any longer bear to witness. After all, the 9/11 Commission Hearings proved that the more boldfaced the lie, the more likely it is that the lie is to be laughed into obscurity. No one, absolutely no one from this administration has ever been found culpable of anything. As we have seen, the incompetent and criminally responsible individuals for 9/11 and its repercussions have either been bestowed promotions or official encomiums. The shell game, thus far, has been flawless.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7954027/#050526">Alterman</a> sums up the current state of affairs in this portentous piece. And <a href="http://coldfury.com/reason/?p=581">Mr. Silber </a>has been bringing these issues to light daily. Through censorship (ostensible and actual), secrecy, obfuscation, fear mongering, subterfuge (legislative), power consolidation, instigation (the political tool of outrageous statements meant to fluster the oppositionâs composure), and the persistent, profligate, and efficacious apparatus of prevarication the Administrationâs stranglehold on the ruling Republican party and the Government at large is currently indomitable. Our individual liberties are being abrogated in secret committees, while the consolidation of power in the agencies of government, i.e. the FBI, the Dept. of Homeland Security, et al, as the new and improved version of the insidious <em>Patriot Act </em>is surreptitiously implemented, becomes the law of the land. It may be true that we can not suppress this omnipotent force until we win back some power in the 2006 elections. However, this does not mean that we should not organize, resist, shed light upon, and persist against the current Administrationâs machinations. </p>

<p>Irrefutably, if the incredible set of astronomically implausible coincidences and mistakes that enabled the tragic attacks of September 11th, 2001 had not occurred, the Bush Presidency, the one that everyone knows was a Supreme Court hijacking of the country, would have been a one note samba of idiocy and, perhaps, the most unpopular administration in U. S. history. After all, Bushâs approval rating in August of 2001, after a steady monthly decline, was at <a href="http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=430">47% and dropping</a>. He was on a seemingly endless vacation, perhaps in preparation for the imminent metamorphosis from blathering idiot to âBring âem on, smoke âem outâ King George. This snippet is from <a href="http://www.literalpolitics.com/BushWeek/bushweekaug.htm">Literal Politics </a>in August of 2001: </p>

<p><em>July 30-August 5</em></p>

<p><em>The Absentee President: Dubya leaves for a month long vacation at his Crawford ranch this week. I say, good riddance!! Take the next 3.5 years off!! Never mind that this is the longest vacation taken by any President since Richard Nixon. Never mind that the average American gets 2 weeks a year, and you already took 14 weekends at Camp David and that nice trip to Kennebunkport. Never mind that Dubya will have spent 42% of his residency on vacation thus far. Really, we forgive your lackadaisical approach to government, especially if you just stay home.</em><em> (Read <a href="http://www.literalpolitics.com/BushWeek/bushweekjune.htm">here</a>, <a href="http://www.literalpolitics.com/BushWeek/bushweekjuly.htm">here</a>, and h<a href="http://www.literalpolitics.com/BushWeek/bushweekaug.htm">ere</a> for a nostalgic trip and very familiar themes, such as Social Security privatization schemes and stem cell research stifling, in those few innocent months before 9/11.)</em> </p>

<p>I am not about to espouse conspiracy theories. However, even a cursory reading by a high school student of the litany of events immediately prior to, during, and after the hijacking and subsequent crashing of airplanes into the <strong><em>World Trade Center </em></strong>and the Pentagon, the crash of <em>Flight 175</em>, and also including the peripheral facts of the <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/10/august6.memo/"><em>August 6th, 2001 </em></a>presidential daily briefing, the Chicago airline stock trades, and endless pieces that all came together with zero forensic evidence ever remaining, should raise more than a bit of incredulity. It is now time to look at all of these facts, demand plausible answers, and scrutinize again and again (it is almost 4 years after all) every detail, and to force these issues into the mainstream. Right now, while the Republicans are showing stress fractures, the Religious Right (check <a href="http://www.5shock.com/ran/scary.html">this </a>out and be very afraid) is starting to really piss people off, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/28/national/28coins.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5094&amp;en=37e6e1eaf5e2f9b5&amp;hp&amp;ex=1117252800&amp;partner=homepage">Doctor Noe conspiracy </a>in Ohio devolves into the fact that Act Two is also a fraud, the impotent Democrats are at least stalling for time, and scores of intelligent writers are watching the Fort, we need to reopen a relentless examination of the disaster that befell the citizenry, and continues to be afflicted upon the Republic, on 9/11/01. Immediately afterwards, the dynamic was in place for a nonresistant Congressional approval of the phantom <strong><em>War on Terror</em></strong>, the <strong><em>Patriot Act</em></strong>, and the consolidation of governmental powers and secrecy. Four years later, and â9/11â is peppered in every speech that Bush gives, every impromptu sound byte, along with the ubiquitous phrase âwar on terrorâ (which was used no less than a dozen times in his bellicose commencement speech yesterday), to keep fear alive, and to perpetually rally the citizenry into a war mode even though the enemy is a phantom idea. I believe that this idea has also shown recent signs of vulnerability. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/war/sept_11/changing_faces_01.shtml">Terrorism </a>has been around for a long time, and will always be the last refuge of the desperate and the first option of the powerless religious or politically fanatical. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdi.org/friendlyversion/printversion.cfm?documentID=1502">This</a> rather lengthy piece discusses the origins, history, and evolution of terrorism. It certainly illustrates the folly of declaring a war upon a method as opposed to a government, country, dictatorship, etc. </p>

<p><em>The word 'terrorism' entered into European languages in the wake of the French revolution of 1789. In the early revolutionary years, it was largely by violence that governments in Paris tried to impose their radical new order on a reluctant citizenry. As a result, the first meaning of the word 'terrorism', as recorded by the AcadÃ©mie FranÃ§aise in 1798, was 'system or rule of terror'. This serves as a healthy reminder that terror is often at its bloodiest when used by dictatorial governments against their own citizens. </em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2002/US-Peaceful-Nation.htm">This</a> excerpt from a book length interview with Howard Zinn comes at the issue from a different perspective. Here Mr. Zinn responds to a NYT headline from 9/23/01 that states, <strong>âForget the Past: Itâs a War Unlike Any Otherâ:</strong> </p>

<p><em>They want us to act as if we were born yesterday. They want us to forget the history of our government. Because if you forget history, if you were born yesterday, then you'll believe anything.</em> </p>

<p>Putting aside for a moment the egregious assault on our individual liberties here at home, letâs take a cursory look at the ongoing Bush agenda facilitated by the benefit of a PSTD-inflicted citizenry post 9/11:</p>

<p>â¢ the war in Afghanistan (supposedly over, but really ongoing and going <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70C13FB3F5D0C738EDDAC0894DD404482">badly</a>) â¢ the war in Iraq (nothing but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/international/middleeast/29iraq.html">good news </a>there) </p>

<p>â¢ military threats against Syria (former clandestine ally), Iran (former clandestine ally), North Korea, et al (and I mean just about anyone who does not possess nuclear weapons) that could become conflagrations at any moment â¢ contempt, disdain, and non-participation in disarmament treaties (see todayâs <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/5/28/82656/0007">Daily Kos</a>)</p>

<p>â¢ contempt for, disdain for, and non-participation in manifold international treaties regarding global warming, the non-development of offensive weaponry in space, and any other treaty that does not fit into the Bush agenda of global domination</p>

<p>â¢ ignoring the desperately in need of humanitarian aid (see todayâs <a href="http://americablog.blogspot.com/2005/05/darfur-calling-time-to-dig-deep.html">America Blog</a>) while propping up the warring religious fanatics of Iraq (as well as those Americans who helped dupe us into the Iraq disaster: see <a href="http://haloscan.com/tb/stevenewsblog/111728420974949137">Gilliard)</a> </p>

<p>â¢ dubious, at best, relationships with China, Russia, Uzbekistan, Saudi Arabia, et al (this list is too long and complex to delineate) </p>

<p>Backing this agenda, along with an ultra-conservative, theocratic oligarchy are the Christian-Right Fundamentalists. Please check out <a href="http://coldfury.com/reason/?p=578">this </a>post at Light of Reason for a scary view into their vituperative attacks on the betrayers of the Republican cause within the ranks. This brings up the teetering-on-the-brink-of-Brave New World domestic agenda of Bush &amp; Co. Letâs start with this totalitarian nightmare of total, irrevocable loss of individual identity, sovereignty, and privacy. The economic machinations of this administration involve a consolidation of financial power in the hands of a minority ruling class of corporate controllers and monetary backers, such as the aforementioned ultra-rich Evangelists, along with a corrupt and manipulated Fed (see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/27/opinion/27krugman.html?incamp=article_popular_2">Krugman</a>). </p>

<p>The subject of the neo-consâ decades of planning to get to this point is one that deserves more space than I am willing to devote here and now. However, along with the crime of 9/11, wherever the culpability lies, these facts must be brought into the daylight of mainstream media, and only the bloggers can accomplish this by relentlessly writing about the truth and exposing the facts, which must be separated from the propaganda; not an easy task. There are many signs, some subtle, some obvious, that the Republican majority is vulnerable right now. However, they are going to be in power for at least two more years, even if we do not bring the lies into the light of day immediately and continuously. For my part, I will now postulate, excogitate, edify, speculate, and expose daily rather than intermittently. <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-27-2005/0003695653&amp;EDATE=">This </a>speech needs to be read in its entirety to understand the intrinsic philosophy of the neo-consâ vision of the incipient decades. The likelihood of an attack on Iran is becoming increasingly apparent. Read (or re-read) <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?050124fa_fact">this</a> piece by Seymour Hersh. Or, check out <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-taheri030703.asp">this </a>talk by scary monster Richard Perle. The deeper we dig into the facts, the more insidious and apocryphal the web of secrecy and power seems to be. </p>

<p>Of course, this is going to seem like pure paranoia, but let me know what you think. Is it possible a deal with the devil was struck between the Clintons and the Bushâs as to, âyou give me this election, and weâll give you 2008,â? I do not have a shred of evidence to make this suggestion, other than the strange bedfellowsâ scenarios that have been extant as of late. Actually, after watching Margaret Carlson kick the evil Novakâs ass yesterday on Crossfire (where Bob called stem-cell research âjunk scienceâ), Iâd sooner her or Barbara Boxer or Diane Feinstein over Hillary. (Hey, check this out for a coincidence, at <a href="http://shakespearessister.blogspot.com/2005/05/zany.html">Shakespeareâs Sister</a>.) But I digress. </p>

<p>This week<strong><em> <a href="http://www.politinfo.com/articles/article_2005_05_26_1124.html">Amnesty International</a> </em></strong>shined the light on the U.S. perpetration of human rights violations on a scale comparable to the gulags of the Stalinist era. This is not an issue of, as Bill OâReilly says, trying to reason with unreasonable people. It is a matter of putting into action the sanctity of human rights that this country professes to support, and that is part of our philosophical underpinnings. More torture in Iraq is discussed in the <em><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1493643,00.html">Guardian</a></em> and, again, at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/5/28/154249/801"><em>Daily Kos</em></a>. The thread here is the blatant disregard for international treaties, agreements, and common decency. It is a disregard based on arrogance, knowledge of impenetrable power, and the designs of which are unimaginable by most of us. </p></div>
