<div>Well Tiger won again and it was nice to see Stewert Cink make him grind for it, was nice with the Ryder Cup coming up.<br />-------<br />Mark Warner of Virginia is going to be the DNC nominee in '08, with Hillary, Barack or Joe Feingold as VP. He is popular with a populist message, center-left and he has a real message besides Bush bashing, and is a strong fundraiser and personable speaker. As Republican's we have to ignore tho loonbat left to an extent and recement our hold over the center. I believe a center right solution driven campaign is what it will take to win. Yes, the GOP majority has dropped the ball a bit but never has our country been hit with so many things at once of such scale, catastrophic hurricanes and islamo-terrorist attacks. Many, many, books by real scholars have been written analyzing the Middle-east and the truth is it is all about oil, keeping it out of the hands of the islamists anymore than it already is. Whether we like it or not the world economy runs on oil and natural gas and an undisturbed flow is crucial. The islamo-fascists  know this as well and seek to get rich and powerful and take over the world. It takes well scholared people to cover a war like this,  to see through the propoganda, that is why I link to folks like Amir Taheri,  Victor David Hansen, Mike Totten, Mike Yon, and Bill Roggio.They all know the region extremely well and all bring a unique perspective, the Mikes are photojournalists and personal , Victor and Amir are historians and Bill and Mike Yon add a military specops perspective. We must win this war and the loonbats of the left the Cindy Sheehan-Michael Moore crowd,  are not the answer nor , I pray, the voice of the DNC.</div>
