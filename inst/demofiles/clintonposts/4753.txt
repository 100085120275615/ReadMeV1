<p>Someone has finally gotten it. Douglas MacKinnon, writing in <em>The Weekly Standard,</em> predicts that Hillary will decide not to run in 2008. He cites what a lot of lefties have known for a while but none have said: HIllary cannot win (duh!!). <br />
MacKinnon, a Republican politico, calls it "Clinton fatigue," and points out that she's one of the most polarizing figures in American poltics. Running Hillary would mean another endless round of debates on Whitewater, Travelgate, and Monica (and I do NOT want to hear any more about that damn cigar!). <br />
Democrats have an opportunity here to address real issues and capture the growing dissatisfaction with W's America. Afterall, the Democratic nominee will be running against a man (and a party) that wants to remarry church and state, pour billions into a massive mistake of a war, and tell the poor to just get over it. Now that's polarizing, and Americans are starting to wake up to it. <br />
To win in 2008, the Dems have to run a non-polarizing (if that's possible), moderate, good ole' boy or girl who can capitalize on the failures of the W administration and actually <em>win.</em> NOT someone who elicits the gag reflex from at least 50% of the population. Spare us, Hillary. </p>
