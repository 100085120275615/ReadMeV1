Well, thats not correct. There is one news story I just cannot stand and will refuse to address it on Stand with Santorum '06, and that is - Rick Santorum is being accused of moving to the left, voting with the likes of John Kerry (D-MA) and Hillary Clinton (D-NY). </p><br /><br /><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp; First of all, he isin't. All politicians feel they have to take a step out of the box every so often. I mean look at President Clinton, he sucked on Foreign Diplomacy and laying the smackdown on terrorists, buthe once ordered bombs and such into Iraq. His wife Hillary, moving a tad center, especially with her abortion feelings, thats been well documented as well. In the Allentown Morning Call last week, (<a href="http://www.mcall.com/news/local/all-a1_5santorumapr11%2C0%2C7081493.story?coll=all-news-hed) it">http://www.mcall.com/news/local/all-a1_5santorumapr11%2C0%2C7081493.story?coll=all-news-hed)</a> it alleged that the Senator is moving left to save his seat in 2006 versus Roberty P. Casey, Jr. The issues used to support this claim:&nbsp; (1) he support to raise the minimum wage, (2) Santorum wanting to limit the death penalty more, just ot name a few.&nbsp; </p><br /><br /><p align="justify">&nbsp; To this writer, there is a legit reason to both of these. Since being elected in 1994 with my dad and Tom Ridge, one of Rick Santorum's claimed of fame personal issues is welfare reform and trying to help the lowe class. A noble trait, I feel the raising of minimum wage, even though this writer does not support it, the raising of the minimum wage is a way for the Senator to show he has not gone away from his hearts feeling to help the lower class. Then the death penalty, we all know the Senator is for the DP, no question there. So all this nonsense he's pulling away from that is not true. He's for it and that thats it. I want to close with this quote from Senator Santorum:&nbsp; ''If you find some common ground, you seize it". In Washington many folks willtake 1 side an stick, I think the Senator's basically saying he's trying to get as many friends as possible, and if that means coming accross as moving a little center - then so be it. In retrospect, he isint.</p>
