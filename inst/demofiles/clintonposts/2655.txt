<div><p><span>It is one thing when a herd of smelly, misshapen hippies form a protest and carry signs saying 'America is a terrorist nation'.&nbsp; It is quite another when a former Vice President, who came within 538 votes of being President of the United States in 2000, goes out to Saudi Arabia and issues statements that make the US government look like a villain in the eyes of Saudis and other Arabs.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>A <a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/004544.htm">full analysis and list of blogs is here</a>.&nbsp; But I don't want to just jump on the right-wing attack bandwagon, so I have tried to assess this as objectively as possible.</span></p>

<p><span>First Gore says, <em>&quot;The U.S. government committed &quot;terrible abuses&quot; against Arabs after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and that most Americans did not support such treatment.&quot;</em>&nbsp; OK, this appears reasonable at first.&nbsp; But, as usual, criticism of America is based on a <strong><u>utopian</u></strong> standard, rather than a realistic assessment of the circumstances at the time, in relation to how other societies in the real world might have reacted to the same.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>But then Gore says, <em>&quot;Arabs have indiscriminately rounded up, often on minor charges of overstaying a visa or not having a green card in proper order&quot;&nbsp; </em>Now, this is where I have to say that he has gone too far.&nbsp; He is openly saying that violation of immigration law (overstaying a visa or not having a renewed greencard).&nbsp; And not just for some harmless Mexican laborer, but for people who fit the demographic profile of the 9/11 hijackers, right after 9/11.&nbsp; If terrorists were to conduct another strike, the first thing they would do is let their immigration paperwork expire, so that they are no longer tracked in the system while they plan an attack.</span></p>

<p><span>What are his solutions on what should have been done to prevent another attack?&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>Yes, Gore says, to an audience in Saudi Arabia, that catching such people is wrong.&nbsp; At other venues, no doubt he will suggest Bush did not do enough to prevent the 9/11 perpetrators from conducting their attack.</span></p>

<p><span>So for a speaking fee of a few hundred thousand dollars, Al Gore is willing to inflame more hatred against the US, that will invariably increase the chances that some Americans get killed.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>From a moderate in the 1980s, Al Gore has drifted further and further to the left under the belief that this faction constitutes a sizable and worthwhile political base, even as <a href="http://futurist.typepad.com/my_weblog/2006/02/an_easy_way_to_.html">the left has become synonymous with anti-Americanism</a>.&nbsp; As anti-Americanism becomes the world's second superpower, more high-profile names will accept payment to speak negatively about their country, the way Al Gore did.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>On a brighter note, if Al Gore was considering running for President in 2008, he has probably thrown his chances away with this speech.&nbsp; Plus, if Hillary Clinton is running in 2008, since her main strategy would be to claim that her election would bring back the happy days of Bill Clinton, the indirect association with the now disgraced Al Gore would be a heavy piece of baggage.&nbsp; </span></p>
