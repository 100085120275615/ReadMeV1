<br />Time: 11:A6 PM.<br />Setting: 4 Times Square, <b>CondÃ© Nast HQ</b>. <br />Mission: Pick up Hillary Duff tix for XYZ Client's daughter at XYZ magazine's publications office. <br />
<br />I was PSYCHED. Breezing through the revolving doors at Nasty HQ, I was undeniably taken aback. Celebrities glossed the walls, security men leered at visiters, but no, they were not screening for guns or bombs, they were screening for leaks. Magazine publishing leaks. <br />
<br />I retrieved my tickets by one of the most lovely Cornellians ever, and she kindly took me to lunch at the infamous cafeteria downstairs. I had pasta (possibly a huge NO NO), and she updated me about her career at XYZ magazine and past careers, while offering some useful tips to a boy about to be swallowed by the real, professional world. She abandoned me for but a moment to retrieve something from her office. THEN THE SHIT HIT THE FAN.<br />
<br />While I was speed-dialing everyone in my life to inform them of my whereabouts, a certain piece of pasta wedged itself somewhere in my tracheal passageways, causing a wonderful reverse flux on my food intake and allowing me to spit pasta (with wonderful trajectory might I add) across the table. I had (basically) vomited food at CondÃ© Nast HQ! Si Newhouse himself must've been smiling upon me from afar, because not a single onlooker had even noticed my little culinary infraction.<br />
<br />I promptly wiped the table down (with at least four napkins), when my lovely guide returned with a cookie and the latest copy of XYZ magazine. I was floored -- maybe they're not all nasty, but they're certainly all ralphing. <br />

<br />Heidi (on deciding where to eat on Fri): Andrew, do you eat sushi.<br />Me: Yes, I just don't eat fish.<br />Heidi: You don't eat fish but you eat sushi?<br />Me: Not when it's cooked, no. <br />
