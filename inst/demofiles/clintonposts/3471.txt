<div>Or is it the CT primary and grace?<br />
<br />This is a semi-watershed moment in the circus that is American politics.  <br />
<br />Dick Cheney's <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/08/10/cheney-ct/">favorite son</a> has been vanquished...washed ashore, found out, and pegged by CT voters.  Sore Loserman will run as an independent.  But this will serve as a commercial to the failure of America's Iraq policy.  So, as Senor Bush once said so famously, bring it on Bodies-man.  <br />
<br />Whether or not people will be as smart as CT voters elsewhere is highly unlikely.  I believe, if I'm not mistaken,<br />Connecticut has a higher ratio per capita of advanced degrees than any other state in the union.<br />Stupid America, in other words, could still yet not figure out the Iraq-con.  But lets just hope this snowballs into an informing avalanche.  And now that Hillary has called for Rummy's resignation, all bets are off.<br />
<br />On other fronts, the terror plot that was foiled so remarkably by the diligence of Met Police of London shall change the equation for midterm elections.  The problem for GOPers now is that they can't really claim to having a good track-record on national security issues.  They haven't made the world any safer.  And now that 60 percent of Americans are against the Iraq war, their platform just became a bit more shaky...as evidenced and indicative by Loserman's loss.<br />
<br />A veritable feed-back loop of HALLELUJAHs!</div>
