Ordinarily the Democrats would not lose a seat in the Senate as a result of their own primary but this Connecticut race has been different all along.  Ultra Liberal Appeasement candidate Ned Lamont challenged three-term Senator Joe Lieberman for his Senate seat this season.  Last night Ned Lamont won the Democratic Primary making him the Democratic nominee for the Senate from Connecticut and not Joe Lieberman.  <br /> <br />Lamontâs support came from the extreme left-wing of the party.  He was propped up a great deal by MoveOn.org and other far left blogs.  He attacked Lieberman for supporting the War on Terror and being âtoo close to Bush.â  That Liebermanâs voting record for 18+ years is 90%+ with the Democrats mattered little in the end.  Lamont has been quoted as saying we need to âoffer incentivesâ to terrorists and rogue states that threaten and kill us.  Ned Lamont represents a return to Clintonian defense policy.  Make âagreed frameworksâ with despotic regimes, because you know the Senate would never approve a treaty with the same terms, and be shocked, shocked to find out the despots have stabbed you in the back and become more threatening with the aid of your âincentives.â  The whole country, Democratic Party leadership first among us, was watching the Connecticut primary.  Ned Lamont and his supporters have just moved the whole Democratic Party farther left.  <br /><br />Joe Lieberman on the other hand is not defeated.  He long ago submitted all the necessary signatures to get himself on the Senate ballot as an independent.  Today he will file the necessary papers to finalize his run for Senator in Connecticut as an independent.  Several polls have already shown that Lieberman is the likely winner in any three-way race.  That is how Ned Lamont and the Democrats have managed to lose a seat in the Senate with their own primary.  Lieberman will win in Connecticut and when he returns to Washington he will not count as a Democrat when it comes to determining control of Congress.  Yes, he has said he will still caucus with the Democrats.  Yes, he certainly will vote as a liberal 90%+ of the time.  However, he wonât vote to âcut and runâ and he wonât vote for impeachment based on a War he supports.  Did I mention he will not count as a Democrat when it comes to control?  Further, the Clintons, and other prominent Democrats, have promised to campaign for Lamont in Connecticut in the general election.  One wonders how bitter Democrats will be about Lieberman running against their wishes and costing them a seat in the Senate.  One wonders how bitter Lieberman will be about the Democrats trying to run him out of office.  <br /><br />So, for Republicans, this primary seems to have played out as our best-case-scenario.  The Democratic Party, via Lamont, has moved farther Left.  They were not winning elections when they were passing themselves off as moderate and only appearing overtly liberal with verbal gaffs like âglobal test.â  Now there will be no denying their Liberal appeasement monkey stripes.  That could turn relatively close national elections into laughers for Republicans.  In addition, the Democrats lose a seat in the Senate.  It would be better if a Republican won the Senate seat but, that may not be possible in Connecticut. It certainly will not happen with the current candidate.  So, in a year that the Democrats hoped to gain control of the Congress for the first time in 12 years, they managed to lose a seat.  <br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />One less criminal, be they Republican or Democrat, in Congress is a very good thing.  Therefore, I say goodbye and good riddance to Cynthia McKinney.<br /><br />--<em>Dan Peugh</em><br /><br /><center><a href="http://alamonation.blogspot.com/"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/img/61/1092/640/alamonation2.jpg" /></a><br /></center><br />
