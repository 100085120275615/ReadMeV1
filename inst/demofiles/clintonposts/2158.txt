<span> thinks that Hillary's immigration positions are pure political calculations. </span>

<span> thinks she should "go to confession for Hillary's Jesus comments. I think both are right on the money and right on the policy. Here's a snippet from Morris' comments:</span>
<br />
<blockquote>"The woman who said that she was 'adamantly against' illegal aliens now compares them to Jesus. Before she said that she felt we needed to police our border but now she opposes making legitimate efforts to protect our borders." But as is usually the case with the Clintons, there a political calculation to Hillary's hypocrisy. "Her statement," says Morris, "reflects the fact that she has to run in Hispanic-heavy New York before she seeks the presidency."</blockquote>
<span>I'm dubious about Morris' last statement since she'll win her Senate race with ease. It's more likely that she's taking the position because she sees her poll numbers low amongst Hispanics nationwide. Otherwise, I think Morri's statements are right. Don't forget the fact that a Clinton will never lose a race if sticking to their principles will cost them the race. He's right in pointing out that Hillary's position on immigration has changed for no apparent reason. That's typical Hillary.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Here's Peter King's take on Hillary's Jesus statement:</span>
<br />
<blockquote>"Talk about hypocrisy," King fumed to New York's Daily News. "I don't think Jesus would have defended alien-smuggling gangs. I don't think Jesus would favor hundreds of immigrants dying in the desert. I hope Hillary's a better senator than a theologian," the Catholic Republican said of the Methodist Democrat. Stopping alien-smuggling gangs is doing God's work," he told Newsday.</blockquote>
<span> It was a stretch to invoke the Good Samaritan into her immigration bill statement. It was utterly over-the-top for her to say that she thinks Republicans would outlaw Jesus. If she keeps talking like this, independants will drop her like a bad habit.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Besides her assinine invoking of Jesus and the Good Samaritan, her opposition to the bill are stupid for the reasons that Peter King states. The vast majority of people want "alien-smuggling gangs" punished. Instead, she's chosen to come out as opposing law enforcement's efforts to stop illegal immigration. That isn't a postion I'd want to defend in front of anyone.</span>
