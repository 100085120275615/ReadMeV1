problems people have with their feet.</p><p><span><strong>EDITORIAL: When Blisters Go Bad</strong></span><br />Editorâs note: This piece ran in my <strong><a href="http://www.vonhof.typepad.com/happy_feet/">Happy Feet blog on June 15th</a></strong> and I think it is so important that I am running it here tooâwith some additional comments and tips.</p>

<p>Blister on the feet are very common, whether on children, teens, or adults. They can occur from all types of footwear in all types of situations, from everyday activities to extreme sports. Occasionally, blister go bad.</p><p><a href="http://vonhof.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2591234_cwank1web_1.jpg"><img width="100" height="163" border="0" src="http://vonhof.typepad.com/fixingyourfeet/images/2591234_cwank1web_1.jpg" title="2591234_cwank1web_1" alt="2591234_cwank1web_1" /></a>Several years ago Hillary Swank was filming Million Dollar Baby and while training, developed a blister on one of her feet. She ignored it and it festered into a raging infection. Hillary ended up in the hospital for treatment. Ignoring the simple blister could have resulted in the loss of her foot from infection.</p>

<p>Then last week, the British Medical Journal published evidence of two cases of children suffering toxic shock syndrome from blisters on their football boots. They describe two cases of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in children after playing football in new boots. Both developed friction blisters over their Achilles tendons. The blisters contained Staphylococcus aureus, which in one case was found to express the toxic shock syndrome gene (TSS1).</p>

<p>In the first case, a 13-year-old girl developed friction blisters over both heels after playing a competitive game of football in new boots. She was admitted to her local hospital after developing a range of symptoms including fever, rash, abnormally low blood pressure (hypotension), vomiting and diarrhea. Further examination revealed a blister, 2cm in diameter, over each of her Achilles tendons containing the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus with the toxic shock syndrome gene (TSS1). A diagnosis of toxic shock syndrome was made and she was treated with antibiotics.</p>

<p>In the second case, a healthy 11-year-old boy played football in a new pair of boots, causing a blister on his right heel. Over the next two days he developed fever, vomiting and diarrhea, and a rash. Within hours of admission to hospital, his condition deteriorated and his blood pressure fell. Again, pus from the blister on his heel contained Staphylococcus aureus. He also developed a secondary rash during convalescence.</p>

<p>Toxic shock syndrome has become less common since the link with tampon use was recognised in the 1980s, write the authors. And in children, for whom this association does not apply, the syndrome is rare. But these cases show that the syndrome may follow relatively trivial skin trauma.</p>

<p>While these two examples are very rare and will not typically affect readers of my newsletter, it pays to be informed. It is easy to dismiss blisters as not needing attention or any special care. </p>

<p>Letâs take a moment and talk about blister care. If you pop a blister or you have a blister with its roof torn off, once you have the chance, apply an antibiotic ointment. </p>

<p>For open blisters, using soap and water, and an antibiotic ointment, Betadine, or hydrogen peroxide is important for avoiding infection. Though you may not use these on an open blister during a run or in the middle of the day while backpacking, at the end of the event or day, take the necessary time to properly treat the open skin. Check your local drugstore for a broad-spectrum antibiotic ointment like Neosporin or Polysporin that provides protection against both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. <strong><a href="http://www.bravesoldier.com">Brave Soldier Wound Healing Ointment</a></strong> is an excellent all-purpose salve to have on hand for blister care.</p><p><a href="http://vonhof.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/foot_infection3.jpg"><img width="100" height="66" border="0" src="http://vonhof.typepad.com/fixingyourfeet/images/foot_infection3.jpg" title="Foot_infection3" alt="Foot_infection3" /></a>Recheck blisters daily for signs of infection. An infected blister may be both seen and felt. An infection will be indicated by any of the following: redness, swelling, red streaks up the limb, pain, fever, and pus. Treat the blister as a wound. Clean it frequently and apply an antibiotic ointment. Frequent warm water or Epsom salt soaks can also help the healing process. Stay off the foot as much as possible and elevate it above the level of your heart. If the infection does not seem to subside over 24 to 48 hours, see a doctor.</p>

<p>The lesson here is that blisters are an injury and must be watched for signs of infection. Iâd wager that 99.9999% of all blisters heal fine. But if that .0001% blister is on your foot, or on the foot of someone you know or love, youâd be more careful. Happy feet are blister free feet.</p>

<p><strong><span>ARTICLE: Out Out Foot Smell</span></strong><br />By Twyla Carolan</p>

<p>It tends to happen in a public place. Youâre sitting in class, at a meeting, or some kind of presentation when suddenly you become acutely aware of the smell of stinky feet. You immediately look with suspicion at those around you, and ask yourself, âWho is it that dares bring smelly shoes and feet into this small enclosed room?â</p>

<p>Of course, then thereâs that sweeping realization that you, yes you, are the one who brought the decomposing footwear, the odorous tootsies.</p>

<p>Keeping your footwear and feet smelling, perhaps not like roses, but at least quite acceptable to the world is very easy to do, and inexpensive. The key is to treat both the feet and the shoes. The most important thing to do is to keep both dry. A warm, moist environment is a breeding ground for bacteria, molds, yeasts, and viral infections, making feet more prone to developing smell, athleteâs foot, rashes, yeast infections, and warts. </p>

<p>To keep the feet clean, dry, and smell-free:<br /><a href="http://vonhof.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/wash.jpg"><img width="100" height="75" border="0" src="http://vonhof.typepad.com/fixingyourfeet/images/wash.jpg" title="Wash" alt="Wash" /></a>â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Use an antibacterial soap on your feet. Lather up and leave on for a minute at least. Natural alternatives include using tea tree and peppermint essential oils on your feet after bathing. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Dry your feet thoroughly. This includes between the toes. Use a hair dryer on your feet if foot moisture leads to bacterial trouble for you. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Do not put on damp or wet footwear. Some foot specialists recommend you donât even wear the same pair of shoes two days in a row. Alternate, to give each pair a chance to thoroughly air and dry out from a dayâs use. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Know that if you wear cotton socks, they will absorb moisture and hold it right next to your skin. To wick moisture away from the feet, better sock-material choices include wool, polypropylene, fleece, synthetics, and so on. However, excluding the superior wool sock, all of the other choices can stink to the high heavens after a certain amount of wear-time unless you specifically buy those with an antibacterial guard. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Change your socks often. Feet sweat. Sometimes the best thing to do for them is to put on a clean, dry pair of socks. </p>

<p>Here are some tips for people whose feet sweat excessively due to genetic traits, athletic endeavors, or environmental factors. Just remember every one of us is unique so even though one of these methods may work well for you it may not for someone else. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Soak the feet daily in a strong tea solution. High in tannins, the tea can âcureâ the feet making them less susceptible to sweating. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Try antiperspirants. The book Fixing Your Feet: Prevention and Treatment for Athletes recommends Ban Roll-on as an over-the-counter product that works well for many people. Normal contraindications apply.<br /><a href="http://vonhof.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/feet_05.gif"><img width="100" height="111" border="0" src="http://vonhof.typepad.com/fixingyourfeet/images/feet_05.gif" title="Feet_05" alt="Feet_05" /></a>â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Try using a foot powder. Gold Bond Powder is the most easily available and most recommended product on the market, aside from Dr Schollâs. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Nylons. What can I say but try never ever to wear nylons all day in enclosed shoes. Remove the feet from the shoes and they can be considered lethal weapons. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your shoes fit. That means enough room to be able to wiggle the toes freely and for your feet to breathe. If in doubt get fitted by a foot professional. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Avoid rubber, vinyl, patent leather, and other types of non-breathable shoe and boot materials.</p>

<p>Treating the footwear itself can be a challenge. Some shoes and boots are almost impossible to deodorize. However, it can be done.<br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Always keep shoes dry. If they get wet, dry as quickly as possible by stuffing them with newspapers, putting them out in the sunlight, or placing them over the gentle heat rising from the vent of your heating system.<br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Donât use a clothes dryer, as even a brief tumble can melt or shrink your shoes irreparably. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; For anti-odor, there are many products on the market from baking soda balls to absorbent volcanic stone. Results are often so-so. For the absolute best treatment, try what many bowling alleysâ use on their often-used-shoes, Lysol disinfectant spray. Try Crisp Linen Scent for a less Lysol-y smell. To use, pull out your shoe insoles and spray the entire surface, giving a spritz inside the shoes too. Let all parts air out for a few hours before wearing. <br />â¢&nbsp; &nbsp; Remove your expensive orthotics then toss footwear into the washer. Caution! Use this method only as a last resort because the washer may partially or completely destroy your footwear. That said fill the washer with water, add bleach if you dare, and soap, toss in footwear, then let her rip. When both spin cycles begin open the washer to make sure the shoes or boots are upside down and able to drain. Dry by the methods listed above. Again, never use the dryer. </p>

<p>I donât know if you can tell, but much of the information above was learned the hard way by me. Yes, Iâve learned hard and Iâve learned well, so Iâll swear the stinky feet in the next meeting wonât be mine. I hope they wonât be yours either. Wink. </p>
