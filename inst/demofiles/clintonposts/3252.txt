<div>I've been wanting to update my blog for a bit, but time, you know. All you people emailing and calling for more pics of the kids...well, feel free to come to LA and visit and maybe babysit while you're here. :)<br />
<br />Let's see...Have you seen <a href="http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/whentheleveesbroke/index.html">WHEN THE LEVEES BROKE: A REQUIEM IN FOUR ACTS</a>?  If not, it'll be reaired fully on Aug. 29th.  I highly suggest that if you have HBO or know someone who does, to watch this documentary.  As most of you know, I'll watch almost any documentary. Never before have I been so affected by one before.  The first 2 acts, I cried from the opening scene to the closing scenes.  It's a crime that something like this has happened in the richest country in the world.  I suppose the richness is solely in monetary terms, because it surely in compassion.  If I hear one more racist asshole go on about how these poor people should have just left, AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHH!!<br />
<br />Speaking of racist assholes, I'm not going to waste my time on Mel Gibson (or the ignorant defending him), nor will I waste my time on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14406528/">Andrew Young</a>'s almost truthful, but still unhelpful remarks.  I will however take a side trip to Shreveport, LA to where <a href="http://www.shreveporttimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060824/NEWS01/608240332/1002/NEWS">9 black children were sent to the back of the school bus</a> because their white bus driver designated the front seats for the white kids. <br />
<br />Yes.  In 2006, there are still black kids being sent to the back of the bus.  I'm livid over this.  I know that there is no way I would have moved to the back of the bus, the bus driver would have had to pick my ass up to get me to move.  Then again, I was taught that I was equal to everyone and that I should stand up for my rights and the rights of others I see are being infringed.  That the kids moved and none of the other kids didn't stand up for them is mind-blowing.  What makes it even worse is their solution:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>After Richmond and Williams filed complaints with the School Board, Transportation Supervisor Jerry Carlisle asked Davis to make seat assignments for her passengers, Sessoms said.<br />
<br />"But she still assigned the black children to the back of the bus," she added.<br />
<br />And the nine children had to share only two seats, meaning the older children had to hold the younger ones in their laps.<br />
<br />
<span>A new solution reached Monday by School Board officials has a black bus driver driving across town to pick up the nine black children.</span>
</blockquote>Say what?  How is that a solution?  I thought segregation was done and over with.  I thought we lived in the US in 2006. <br />
<blockquote></blockquote>But then again, I guess I shouldn't really be surprised.  After all, Senator George Felix Allen decided calling an American born-Indian staff member of his politcal oppenent <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G7gq7GQ71c">'macaca'</a> is being defending by the GOP.  This is a guy who has flown the <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2006/08/16/allen/index_np.html">confederate flag</a>, had a noose on a tree in his office and now used a term hip in the white-supremacist crowd. <br />
<br />Oh.  I guess I should mention that the so-called President of the <span>United States</span> did a <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060822/ap_on_el_ge/bush_allen">fundraiser</a> for this bigot this weekend.  It was clear in 2001 that the shrub only represented the Republican part of the US.  It was extremely clear in 2002 that he only represented the Christian part of the US.  It was clear in 2003 that he only represented those people who don't care about the enviroment, science or any other intellectual pursuit.  It was clear in 2004 that he only represented the heterosexual part of the US.  It was clear in 2005 that he only represented the white part of the US.  It's now clear in 2006 that he only represents the racists/bigotted part of the US. <br />
<br />Back to Allen.  After he showed his true colors, first he tried to act like he made the word up (like he's that clever), then he gave a half-assed apology ("I'm sorry you got offended I called you a racist name"), this his campaign manager with the most appropriate name, <span>Dick Wad</span>hams, blamed the media--because you know, the GOP, the party of "personal responsibility" always admits when they've done something wrong.   <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/8/22/13152/6843">The memo</a> Wadhams sent out is below (h/t to lowkell):<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<b>Memo from Dick Wadhams</b>
<p> Memorandum</p>
<p> To: GOP leaders/Allen campaign leadership<br />From: Dick Wadhams, Campaign Manager<br />Re: Notes on a tough week<br />August 19, 2006</p>
<p> I think it is obvious that this past week was difficult one for Senator and Mrs. Allen and the campaign. It is very clear that <b>the news media created what they call a "feeding frenzy"</b>, with the Washington Post alone doing major stories on the same issue for 5 consecutive days.</p>
<p> <b>Literally putting words into Senator Allen's mouth that he did not say</b> (by speculating, defining and attributing meanings and motives that simply are not true), the Webb campaign and the news media seeming worked hand-in-hand to create national news over <b>something that did not warrant coverage in the first place</b>.</p>
<p> Even after Senator Allen apologized to the Webb campaign staffer in specific, and to anyone who may have been offended in general, the news media continued to print and re-print the same speculations and inaccurate portrayals of Senator Allen's comments. <b>Never in modern times has a statewide officeholder and candidate been so vilified</b> in a desperate attempt to revive a campaign that was fast-sinking - the Webb campaign.</p>
<p> Senator Allen has said that his comments were a mistake. <b>Who among us has not made mistakes</b>? In fact, how many of us could put in the hours of work, travel, meetings, campaigning, etc. that Senator Allen has over the years and make as few mistakes as he has?</p>
<p> Apparently the media's standard for candidates is now that <b>they must be perfect, not human, and that no mistake or verbal gaffe is to be forgiven</b>, no matter how much the candidate apologize. Will the Washington Post hold it's candidate for the U.S. Senate to the same standard? We will see, but I'm not holding my breath.</p>
<p> The bottom line for us, friends, is that same as it has always been.  <b>We cannot rely on the news media to get our positive, constructive message out to the voters. In fact, we cannot expect them to be objective, let along fair</b>. As always, we have to do it together, getting our message directly to the voters. </p>
<p> Senator Allen has a long, positive, successful track record as a member of the House of Delegates and House of Representatives, as our Governor and now as our United States Senator.</p>
<p> There is hardly a place you can go in the Commonwealth that Senator Allen has not visited at least once or touched in some way. Senator Allen and Susan Allen have impacted the lives of tens of thousands of Virginians through their public service and volunteer activities. This is evident to anyone who has participated in a Listening Tour stop this year.</p>
<p> <b>He was there long before his opponent discovered there were such places in Virginia</b>. And, he will be there long after his opponent has faded from the scene.</p>
<p> <b>Looking Ahead</b>
</p>
<p> There is no question that this is a tough year to run for the Senate as a Republican. The Democrats and their liberal constituency groups, such as MoveOn.org, are pouring millions of dollars into television attack ads, seeking to take control of the Senate and House. <b>Rep. Thelma Drake has already been a target of their vicious attacks. We expect to see Senator Allen attacked in the same way</b>.</p>
<p> The reason the <b>Democrats run such negative campaigns and always play the race card, is that they have no positive ideas to run on</b>. That is as true this year as in any other. The fact that they have attempted to make race an issue so early in the campaign is evidence of just how desperate they are.</p>
<p> Senator Allen summarizes his public service as making Virginia a better place to live, learn, work and raise a family. And, <b>that's what this campaign is all about</b>.</p>
<p> Senator Allen will win because he is right on the issues. He will win because he has done a great job as Senator and Governor. He will win because he has stayed in touch with Virginians and been responsive to their needs. He will win because he and Susan will work harded than anyone to get the job done. </p>
<p> And, Senator Allen will win because of your help and support. Now is the time to rally for Senator Allen and our Congressional candidates. Now is the time to get <b>our positive message</b> out door-to- door, by telephone and at fairs, festivals and meetings of all sizes.</p>
<p> You are the secret weapon that Senator Allen has always confounded the pundtis with.</p>
<p> Let's show the liberal interest groups that by coming to Virginia, they have gotten more than they bargained for and that <b>they need not bother us ever again</b>!</p>
<p> Dick Wadhams, Campaign Manager</p>
</blockquote>The thing that's funniest about that is that Wadhams starts out blaming the media and Webb of putting words in the Senator's mouth.  Then he says that Allen's comments were a mistake.   So which is it?  Or was Wadhams drunk when he wrote that? <br />
<br />But really, the crown jewel of this poorly written piece of stupid is the sentence in the middle: Never in modern times has a statewide officeholder and candidate been so vilified.  <span>Never? </span> Never!  Okay, I know that some retarded Republican out there will accuse me of having a "pre-9/11 mindset", but I seem to remember this guy...think he was the President...name of Clinton.  Then again, Republicans are awesome at the revisionist thing, so maybe "modern times" only began when Bush was given the presidency in 2000.</div>
