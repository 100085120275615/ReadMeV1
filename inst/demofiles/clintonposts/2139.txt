<div align="justify">The so-called "smartest woman in America," Hillary Clinton, apparently can't write her own speeches, at least not fully, and instead decided to lift a line from her husband's 1993 inaugural speech as she addressed the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday. Senator Clinton ended her speech to the group by saying:<br />
<br />"There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be fixed by what is right about America."<br />
<br />Here is Bill's version ending his inaugural speech in 1993:<br />
<br />"There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America."<br />
<br />I don't know whether the <em>redux</em> says more about Mrs. Clinton's intelligence or what she thinks about the intellect of her audience, and frankly either answer scares me. And the <em>AP/Washington Post</em> called her remarks "very slightly revised." That's like saying every movie role Elvis ever played was "slightly revised."<br />
<br />And in the midst of the media's week of "Perky Couric" self gloss, in which they get to report on their favorite subject, themselves, allow me a quick aside to discuss the disjointed bilge coming from the <em>Washington Post</em> these days. What kind of sycophantic blather are these people offering? Not only is this <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/05/AR2006040501711_pf.html">
<span>article</span>
</a> full of barely veiled adulation for the Clinton's, it's horribly written and apparently unedited. Get a load of this sentence that describes Bill's life after being President:<br />
<br />"He explained that an inability to play on golf's senior tour, limited saxophone skills and a hardworking ethos forced him to <strong>created</strong> the William J. Clinton Foundation to take on the challenges of global interdependence."<br />
<br />And no, I didn't type that wrong, I just emphasized the glaring error which might have slipped past spell check but not a pair of human eyes! Apparently, the <em>Washington Post,</em> in their recent haste to jettison some 60 jobs, made sure that all of those canned were proofreaders. Either that, or they, like the Clinton's, are confident that the American public is oblivious. But is the public oblivious enough to put Hillary back in the White House, this time as number one? If so, I think we have a pretty good idea of what her inaugural address will sound like. Think Bill, just more shrill. </div>
