<div>I voted for Bush twice. There was no choice. I am so disappointed in the domestic agenda of the current administration. I feel we are heading to a 2 term Hillary presidency. There are dark clouds on the horizon. The same thing happened to his father. The Bushes get things done by consensus. They try to build alliances and have no clue how the opposition operates. If you cross the Bushes, lookout. There are lifetime reprecussions. They will shun you forever unlike the Clinton's who just kill you. The country is headed for another civil war. After 8 years of Hillary rule, probably 60% of the populace will be on some type of government program for their healthcare, housing, food, or education. The U.S. will never recover from a Hillary presidency. The only hope will be for pockets of the country to resist the almighty federal dollar and operate independent of the federal government. I pray I am wrong for the sake of my children. Socialism is around the corner until it comes crumbling down. The producers in this country will go elsewhere just like in current Europe. The moto of this story is take care of yourself. Get out of debt and be ready to outrun the coming storm. Only the strong will survive in this environment. Please take a warning from the New Orleans disaster. You saw on TV what a lifetime of government dependence produces. People who are totally unable to take care of themselves and people who take advantage of those people.</div>
