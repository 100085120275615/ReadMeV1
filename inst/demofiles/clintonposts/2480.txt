<strong>Washington Journalist Throws Dick Cheney's Jackboots Into the Ring for the 2008 Presidential Election, Without Prior Authorization from the Prince of Darkness Himself</strong>

<br />Apparently all the buzz in Washington right now is that Dick Cheney, variously called "The Prince of Darkness" and "Darth Vader" by his enemies (and even some friends, anonymously), may well be enlisted to run for President on the Republican ticket in 2008. If true, it means that the man who started all the buzz--journalist Bob Woodward, who in a recent speech speculated the current Vice-President, despite his protestations, would indeed run for the Oval Office--may have just handed Democrats the keys to the White House in '08.<br />
<br />Frankly, most of the country is either a) scared of Dick Cheney, b) convinced he is a virulent liar, or c) both. There is no way the man will ever be our President, and if Republicans somehow mistake his basement-dwelling approval ratings for a temporary phenomenon, so much the better for the '08 Democratic candidate, be it Hillary, Joe Biden, John Edwards, or (the long-shot candidate) Al Gore.<br />
<br />It's a testament to conservatives' delusory political adherence to the worst presidential administration in the history of the United States that they actually believe a man who's lied not once, not twice, but numerous times on nationally-televised broadcasts could become the President of the nation. [Keep in mind that Clinton's lies were exposed after he'd already been in office and once re-elected; keep in mind, also, that Clinton has always enjoyed substantially higher approval ratings than the sometimes-somnambulent, always moderately-threatening Cheney, largely owing to the fact that the former has at least a hint of personal charisma, and lacks the permanent sneer and bone-chilling beady eyes of the angry senior citizen currently occupying the Vice-President's office].<br />
<br />When you consider, also, that Condoleeza Rice--whose only distinguishing characteristic is her staggering and perhaps unprecedented professional incompetence--and Dick Cheney are the two leading candidates for the Republicans in 2008, and that the next runner-up, Senator Bill Frist (R-TN) not only has the personality of a 2x4 but also, apparently, principles to match (even current Senator and former Majority Leader Trent Lott [R-MS], in a recent autobiography, makes clear he despises him) you realize just how desperate the Republicans <em>are</em> right now.<br />
<br />Meanwhile, Bush's supposedly safe Supreme Court nominee seems to have (in my words) "issues with women," as well as "issues with civil rights," as well as notable ethical handicaps (see my prior post on this), so all bets are off the table now on his successful advancement to the nation's highest court. Indeed, all bets are off for the entire Republican Party right now, except, I suppose, for this: that it seems almost certain <em>someone</em> in the Bush Administration will suffer a federal criminal indictment come October, assuming Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald's Valerie Plame investigation continues to proceed apace.<br />
<br />So, a big "thank you" to Bob Woodward and, in the immortal words of George W. Bush himself, "Dick Cheney in 2000! [sic] Dick Cheney in 2000! [sic]"<br />
<br />[The quote above is fabricated; but if you don't think Bush, during the presidential campaign in 2000, awoke in a cold sweat shouting these very words on countless occasions, you've not been following politics closely these last five years].</div>
