Sometimes, late at night, if I wear a bag over my head, he lets me in the house to eat left-overs.â<br /><br /><blockquote>3/2 WASHINGTON (CNN) -- The chairman of Israel's largest shipping firm has strongly backed a deal that would give a United Arab Emirates-based shipping company control of several U.S. port terminals, while another GOP leader expressed strong oppositionâ¦ In a letter to Sen. Hillary Clintonâ¦Israelâs Zim[âs]â¦Idon Ofer called state-owned DP World a strong business partner, despite the United Arab Emirates' boycott of Israel. Full article <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/03/02/port.security/index.html">here</a>.<br /></blockquote>The article explains that despite the boycott, Zimâs boats are allowed to call at Dubai, provided they fly the flags of countries other than Israel.<br /><br />I wonder if Zim truly loves DP World or if they believe (or have been told) that theyâre pita crisps if they donât play along.<br /><br />Wordâs also out that Sen. Clintonâs husband has advised DP World on the deal. I expect to hear the same about Mrs. Schumer, next.<br /><br />The article also mentions an appeal by âU.S.-based cargo handler Eller & Co.â Is this the player in the shadows who I speculated about in my previous post?<br /><br />Shabbat shalom.
