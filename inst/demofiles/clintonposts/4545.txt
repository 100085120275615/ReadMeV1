<p>I just read an <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/norman-solomon/whos-afraid-of-hillary-c_b_27233.html">interesting post by Norman Solomon </a>over at the Huffington Post. Solomon is calling for a campaign to challenge Hillary in her New York campaign for Senator.</p>

<blockquote>The leading pro-war Democrat in the Senate is hoping for a landslide in the New York primary next month. And unless progressives quickly mobilize to dent her vote total, she's likely to get it.

<p>Hillary Clinton, of course, intends to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2008. But first there's her quest to win big for reelection.<br />
If antiwar voters cut into Clinton's percentage in the primary on Sept. 12, despite overwhelming media visibility and a massive campaign war chest, her momentum would take a hit.</p>

<p>After Sen. Joe Lieberman lost to antiwar challenger Ned Lamont in Connecticut's Democratic primary last week, I thought some more about the fast-approaching Senate race in New York, where anti-war candidate Jonathan Tasini will be on the ballot next to Clinton.</p>

<p>Tasini, a former president of the National Writers Union, is more strongly and consistently antiwar than Lamont. And Tasini is an all-around progressive on issues <em>(In other words, he's an even bigger nutcase)</em> from trade to economic justice to health care to the Middle East. But his campaign is underfunded. In contrast, the very wealthy <em>(how dare he be rich!)</em> Lamont self-financed his campaign with a few million dollars.</blockquote></p>

<p>This is the best part folks. Solomon wanted Moveon.org to help him do to Hillary what they did to Lieberman.</p>

<blockquote> One of the biggest boosts to Lamont's primary campaign came from MoveOn.org, which polled its membership in Connecticut and found a large majority in favor of endorsing Lamont. The MoveOn endorsement brought more funding and people-power energy to the campaign against Lieberman.

<p>MoveOn members helped to invigorate that campaign, as they have strengthened so many other grassroots efforts in recent years. And MoveOn's leaders have earned respect for their far-sighted work on building a powerful nationwide organization.</p>

<p>Today, this question hangs in the air: Will MoveOn now poll its membership in New York about whether to make an endorsement in the Clinton vs. Tasini race?</p>

<p>I put the question to the executive director of the MoveOn.org political action committee, Eli Pariser. Here's his full reply: "We focus on the issues and candidates our members are excited about. We've heard almost nothing from MoveOn members on Tasini -- New York MoveOn members are more focused on winning back Congress, ending the war on Iraq, and Ned Lamont. As for our formal endorsement process, that's triggered where there are two viable candidates and where there's a baseline of interest from our members. Right now, this one doesn't meet that second threshold."</p>

<p>But the only reliable way to find out how interested New York members of MoveOn would be in a Clinton-or-Tasini endorsement is to ask them. And, evidently, that's a question that the people in charge of MoveOn.org don't want to ask.</blockquote></p>

<p>LOL! This is a very interesting development folks. I have always wondered about Moveon.org and Hillary. If I'm right, they created that organization because they were Clinton supporters who wanted people to get past the Clinton scandals and impeachment. How interesting to see that they don't want to mess with Hillary. It makes you wonder what will happen in 2008. Will Moveon.org split with the left wing kook bloggers and side with Hillary? How fun would that be? Stay tuned.....</p>
