<span>Sigh. I mean, what do you expect? Myself, </span><span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/1600/belligerencesquared.0.jpg">my co-worker Belligerence Squared,</a> and <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/1600/molly.2.jpg">my <span>Crazy Ass Cousin Molly</span></a></span><span><span><span> all have a problem with American cars </span>and regularly and routinely mock them. I mean, Molly even rides a Japanese made 12 Speed. <span>General Motors</span>, being an American car company can't manufacture a decent car much less put together a fashion show. I need them to spend less money on fashion shows and invest in figuring out how to make those damned <span>GMC Jimmy</span>'s stop flipping the fuck over. Priorities people. Without further ado, let the judgefest begin. Gentlemen start your engines:</span></span><br /><br /><div><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/1600/PAT.1.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/400/PAT.0.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span><span>From left to right </span><span>Regina King</span><span> (from Ray), TV Host </span><span>Pat O'Brien</span><span> and actress  <span>Halie Duff</span> (a.k.a </span><span>Hilary</span><span>'s younger, less attractive sister). The coldness and darkness of this photo is giving me goosebumps. </span><span>Regina King</span><span> proves she's a talented actress by pretending she is totally okay with this, pretending she is okay with </span><span>Pat O'Brien</span><span>s cokehead ass, and pretending </span><span>Pat O'Brien</span><span>s cokehead ass cornball comments are funny. Now </span><span>that's</span><span> talent. </span><span>Halie Duff</span><span>'s only claim to fame is that her father busted a nut in the wrong orifice (should have gone for the mouth bro) approximately two years after </span><span>Hillary</span><span> was born. </span><span>Pat O'Brien</span><span> appears to have on a pastel pink blazer, and dark stiff denim jeans a la Cross Colours from the </span></span><span><span>early 90's</span></span><span><span>. Isn't he on </span><span>Access Hollywood</span><span>, or one of those meaningless </span><span>Entertainment Tonight</span><span>-esque shows? I gained so much more respect for him when I found out that he tooted coke, </span></span><span><span>and telephone stalked women. </span><span>Pat</span><span>, you are a G but I need you to work on that damned sinus congestion problem I mean gotdamn! I leave you with two words <span>Pat</span>:<span> NASAL DECONGESTAN</span></span></span><span><span><span>T</span>. Try it sometime. It really works.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></span><br /><div><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/1600/vivica.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/400/vivica.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span>I</span><span>'m really starting to think <span>Vivica A. Fox </span>is off her rocker. I think she truly may have lost her marbles since the whole <span>50 Cent</span> thing. Her hair is foofy-foo and more or less looks like she has a leisure curl. And apparently she didn't get the memo that the peasant blouse/skirt look is not meant to be combined with sparkly shit. It is simply unacceptable. But perhaps the coldest darkest place is the fact that she is comfortable posing behind a<span> <span>MINI-VAN</span>.</span> The shit doesn't even look new, it looks like a <span>1988 Ford Aerostar</span> with a really bad marble paint job. I swear I can see knicks and dents in the front bumper. <span>Sidebar</span>: Umm, ladies of Hollywood just one word of advice. When you opt to have plastic surgery and put botox in your lips & shit, keep this in mind; you can leave your shit as is and look like an old(er) woman, or you can fuck with your shit and end up looking like old(er) transvestite. It's your call.</span><br /><span><br /></span><span><br /><br /><br /></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/1600/indiarie.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/400/indiarie.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><div><span>Now I respect <span>India-Arie</span>'s gangsta (although purchasing any of her albums has never and will never even remotely crossed my mind) because her message, and her overall look is belligerent and anti-establishment. But this shit? Uh-uh. Hell no. HELL NO. I gave you a pass when you rocked the fade for like a year but this shit here? Oh no no no. She looks like ghetto ass african mermaid.<br /></span><br /><br /><span><br /><br /><br /></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/1600/ashtondemi.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/400/ashtondemi.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span><span>Ashton & Demi</span><span> are "<span>friends in my head</span>" (dove love to </span><span>Wendy Williams</span><span> for hipping me to grown-up imaginary friends). We have tuna sandwiches at the ranch in Idaho, I play Scrabble with </span><span>Rumor</span><span> and </span><span>Scout</span><span>....</span><span>Ashton</span><span> looks like he has that putrid morning breath in the above photos. I need for his eyes not to be bloodshot, and I need</span><span> Demi</span><span> to have opted for the size 10 dress instead of the 6. I mean...plaid isn't meant to be tight fitting....the bitch might fracture a rib if she sneezes.....<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></span></span></div><div><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/1600/reggiebush-crunk%26disorderly.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/2384/2197/400/reggiebush-crunk%26disorderly.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span><span>courtesy of crunktastical.blogspot.com</span><br /></span><br /><div><span>According to the caption on</span><span><a href="http://crunktastical.blogspot.com/"> </a><a href="http://crunktastical.blogspot.com/"><span>Crunk & Disorderly</span></a></span><span> the above luscious piece of man chocolate is </span><span>Reggie Bush</span><span>.
