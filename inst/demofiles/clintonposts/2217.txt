<br />The third day of our Vegas trip was all about love.  There is the love I have for Hillary ... and then, the new Beatles' Cirque de Soleil show - <i>Love</i> - which was surprise number four in a weekend that had already been full of surprises.  You may recall when I blogged about <i>Love</i> some time back and then I certainly did not imagine that I would be seeing it so soon after its opening.  Throughout the entire performance, I felt just like a little kid, grinning every time one of my favorite songs came on.<br />

</a>In the performance, there was lots of dancing, some acrobatics involving roller skates and trampolines (not at the same time, though), and some fantastic costumes.  Of course, the real pleasure for me was getting to hear the music - remixed by Beatles producer George Martin and his son Giles - in a theater that had been redesigned for this show.  The sound was so crisp as songs faded seamlessly from one to the next often taking bits and pieces of other songs with them.  The acapella "Because" opens the show at a slow pace before bouncing into the sheer electricity of the first seconds of "A Hard Days Night" leading into "Get Back" amplified by drums and guitar from "The End."  This mash-up approach characterizes the music but never becomes a gimmick.  A high point was hearing "Being For the Benefit of Mr. Kite" - which has always deserved the theatrical treatment - slowly faded into "I Want You (She's So Heavy)" turning a circus storyline for playful to dark.  <br />
<br />The Beatles themselves are not portrayed in the show.  They do however make appearances on video screen and through in-studio conversations re-edited as to show songs developing from your very eyes.  In the heartbreaking "Strawberry Fields Forever" performance, we hear various versions of the song build up until it ultimately becomes the finished product.  The Beatles as an entity seem beyond portrayal.  Unlike Vegas favorite Elvis Presley, it seems impossible to mimic and embody all stages of the Beatles career.  Thus, <i>Love</i> (and even the musical <i>Lennon</i>) portray them as larger than life figures, whose music influences and defines the surrounding culture.  <i>Love</i> paints a portrait of London and American streets populated by the characters of their songs - Sgt. Pepper, Father McKenzie, the Nowhere Man and Lady Madonna to name a few.  <br />
<br />It's a fantastic experience and one that I will not soon forget.  <br />
<br />Here's a 10-minute summary/sneak peek...<br />
