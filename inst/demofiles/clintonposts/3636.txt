<div>The talk of a Hillary presidential run is picking up, with Time magazine's current cover story.  Many in the blogosphere seem to be against a run by her, for one main reason that I see:  that she's unelectable and we can't afford to lose 2008.<br />
<br />Read on past the quotes -<br />
<br />
<em>Hillary Clinton may be the most polarizing figure on the current political landscape. TIME asked respondents about 11 phrases one could use to describe her, from "likable" to "would protect America against terrorism." Democrats and Republicans disagreed by a margin of over 40 points on the applicability of eight of them, and by 50 points on three, including "strong leader" (Republicans 25%, Democrats 77% ), "would protect America against terrorism" (Republicans 17% , Democrats 67% ), and "has strong moral values" (Republicans 16% , Democrats 69% ). Democrats and Republicans come closest in agreement on her intelligence (Republicans 73% , Democrats 91% </em>
<br />
<br />
<em>Most Americans agree that Hillary Clinton is intelligent (81%) and that she's politically moderate (67%). She's the Democratic nominee they'd support the most if she runs for President (leading the field with 46%, just ahead of Al Gore's 41). And a majority (53%) agree that she makes a generally favorable impression.</em>
<br />
<br />So, we can all agree that people either love her or hate her - few are dispassionate.<br />
<br />I take a somewhat unpopular blogoworld stance:  I really, really want her to run.  And, of course, I want her to win.  And I am personally willing to do way more than I've ever done to assist in a political campaign for her.<br />
<br />The reason has to do with a TV show recently, regrettably, cancelled.  Did you ever see 'Commander in Chief'?  Geena Davis portrayed the first US female president.  And she played her as intelligent, witty, a sexual being, a mother and daughter, thoughtful, ambivalent, sometimes dumb and naive - in other words, three dimensional.  I called all my young nieces to make sure they watched the show - to see a woman as a poltical leader, even if a fictional one.<br />
<br />I want Hillary to run for a lot of reasons.  I like her politics (OK, not the war vote, but she's matured), I like her recent public emasculation of Rummy, I like her street smarts, I like her trials-by-fire, I like her resilience  --  and I really like that she's a powerful, charismatic person.  I think it's vital for women in this country, young and old alike, to see a truly viable female candidate have a go at it, and actually have the chance to get the brass ring.  I want my nieces to have her as a role model.  I want that ultimate glass ceiling shattered. So many, many countries around the world have, or have had, female leaders - but not us.  Answering 'why' might detract from energy that could be used to make it happen.<br />
<br />Am I being sexist, wanting a woman?  Perhaps, although i would support the exact same qualities she has in a man.  Am I being naive? Perhaps.  Am I being realistic?  Perhaps.  I just know that finally, 24 years after Geraldine Ferraro ran for Vice-President, the time is right for the US to make a change.<br />
<br />I want a female President.  And Hillary Clinton has what it takes to get the job done - even if her judgement stinks sometimes.  And Barbra Streisand likes her, so what else could one want??</div>
