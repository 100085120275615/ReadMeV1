<p>Not many. That&#8217;s the problem.  Most politicians <i><u>have</u></i> proven themselves, based on their <a href="http://home.comcast.net/~d.a.n/WhatAllVotersShouldDo1.htm" rel="nofollow">voting records.</a></p>
<p>If Democrats want to win back the Executive Branch, they might want to find something better than Hillary.  If Republicans want to hold on to the Executive Branch, they might want to find something better than McCain.  </p>
<p>But, of those two, who is more corrupt<b>?</b><br />
Hillary is definitely, hands down, far more corrupt.</p>
<p>We need better choices, but the system (a culture of corruption) seems uncapable of providing any.  </p>
