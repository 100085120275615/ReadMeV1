Former President Bill Clinton is <a href="http://www.journalinquirer.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16945479&BRD=985&PAG=461&dept_id=161556&rfi=6" target="_blank">slated</a> to campaign for Senator Joe Lieberman on Monday.  Kudos to Clinton (won't hear THAT often on these pages) especially given the fact that Lieberman condemned him on the Senate floor over the Lewinsky scandal. <br /><br />As much as the Democratic Party is nearly useless I see no joy in seeing it completely taken over the loathesome Far Left.<br /><br />HT: <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/014761.php" target="_blank">Powerline</a>
