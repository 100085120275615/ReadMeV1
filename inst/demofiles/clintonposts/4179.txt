If not, why trust him with your military?" height="96" width="64" class="left" /></a>Are we sheep?  Oh HELL yes, we are.  Like a bunch of brainless idiots, we&#8217;ll be calling either this guy, or his <a href="http://www.guntotingliberal.com/archives/1150">drinking buddy</a>, NY Senator Hillary Clinton &#8220;President&#8221; before long, because that is precisely how gullible we are.  We continue to display this gullibility year after year after year; we vote for the &#8220;lesser of two evils&#8221; as if that justifies us for casting a vote toward pure evil.  And we&#8217;ll be voting for one or the other of these buffoons in &#8216;08 unless America grows some &#8216;nads; mark my words.  </p>
<p>My only saving grace will be that I will not be voting for EITHER of these jerks in &#8216;08, even if I have to vote for a third party or independent candidate again.  Some of us feel the need to be able to sleep with ourselves at night; to look the man, or woman in the mirror in the eyes every morning.  I am one of these; and I who prefer to do this with pride and no disdain.  A vote for the &#8220;lesser of two evils&#8221; is a vote for &#8220;evil&#8221; every single TIME, and don&#8217;t you forget it.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just take a look at this doubletalking, <em>2-bit</em> dork from Arizona for a moment, shall we? </p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The McCain Makeover</strong><br />
<em>Does the veteran Republican rebel really mean all those nice things he&#8217;s saying about George W. Bush?</em></p>
<p>IT&#8217;S FEBRUARY 15, 2000, a pivotal moment in the race for the Republican nomination for president, and at the televised candidates&#8217; debate in Columbia, S.C., temperatures are rising.</p>
<p>John McCain, fresh off an upset victory in the New Hampshire primary, has run into a buzz saw of negative advertising about his record and rumor-mongering about his personal life, and he blames his main opponent, George W. Bush.</p>
<p>&#8220;You should be ashamed,&#8221; a tight-lipped McCain scolds Bush.</p>
<p>Bush has his own beef: McCain&#8217;s ads have likened Bush&#8217;s character to that of Bill Clinton. &#8220;You can disagree with me on issues, John, but do not question &#8212; do not question my trustworthiness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;. . . You&#8217;re putting out stuff that is unbelievable, George, and it&#8217;s got to stop,&#8221; McCain retorts. &#8220;. . . This is probably the nastiest campaign that people have seen in a long time.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;. . . Listen, you&#8217;re playing the victim here,&#8221; Bush shoots back. &#8220;Wait a minute, remember who called who untrustworthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Six years later, Bush is president and McCain is preparing for another run for the White House. He&#8217;s in Michigan on a Friday afternoon at the start of a long weekend of raising money for local Republican candidates and laying the groundwork for 2008. And everywhere he goes, he&#8217;s got only good things to say about George W. Bush.</p>
<p>He praises Bush&#8217;s steadfastness on the war in Iraq and says he&#8217;s especially proud of Bush&#8217;s support for the Senate&#8217;s immigration bill. &#8220;I think the president has shown a lot of courage on this issue,&#8221; he tells a crowd of activists at Kent County GOP headquarters in Grand Rapids, many of whom seem a lot less certain on the matter.</p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s changed since 2000? someone in the audience asks McCain.</p>
<p>&#8220;My personality has improved significantly,&#8221; quips the senator from Arizona. &#8220;I took a Dale Carnegie course.&#8221; &#8230;&#8221; - <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/23/AR2006082301586.html">Washington Post</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Dale Carnegie course, my aching BUTT.  Senator McCain has been possessed with the Presidency for years, and while many might find that to be admirable, I find it to be completely creepy and alarming.  Like his fellow Skull and Bones buddy, Senator Kerry, who carried home video cameras into the combat zones of Vietnam in the 70&#8217;s to capture future &#8220;Presidential moments&#8221;, both guys need to be laying on their backs on a couch, telling it to a shrink.  They most CERTAINLY do not need to be Governing our Nation.  </p>
<p>And as for Senator Clinton, I would not be surprised at all if her blind ambition wasn&#8217;t behind her husband&#8217;s ascent to the Governorship of the State of Arkansas, and later, the Presidency of the United States in order to better pave HER way to the Oval Office either.  THINK about it.  These are all quite ruthless people with one thing on their minds, and one thing ONLY - world domination.  Whatever happened to the concept of service to one&#8217;s country being the number one factor in a candidate&#8217;s ambition for reaching the higher offices of our land?</p>
<p>But since this post is about the wannabe President from Arizona, let&#8217;s just think about what he is, who he is, and what he wants for a moment.  He&#8217;ll say ANYTHING to be awarded the Presidency, or &#8220;POWER&#8221;, if you prefer.  And if you people choose to vote for somebody who simply seeks power, and is willing to contradict himself (or herself) again and again, before God and everybody to attain it, then you get the Government and the <em>governers</em> you deserve.</p>
<p>As for me, I&#8217;ll be able to sleep with myself at night for years to come, because if it were up to me, I&#8217;d be like that family member who&#8217;s trying to convince the judge that my crazy uncle (John) and aunt (Hillary) are incompetent and are in need of an executor to act on their behalves in legal matters for their own good.</p>
<p>Neither one of these wackos needs to be in control of our military and the extremely important matters and dangers facing our great Nation right now though, and that is for SURE.  Straight jackets and rubber walls might be more in order than the title of &#8220;Leader Of The Free World&#8221; for these two NUTJOBS, but that&#8217;s just ME.
