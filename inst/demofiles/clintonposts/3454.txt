<div>Okay, now it's crunch time:
<br />
<br />I have two Presidential predictors that will either be affirmed or wrecked tomorrow (or whenever the vote counting stops):
<br />
<br />1) Incumbent Presidents with 4-letter last names do not win re-election (or in Ford's case, election).
<br />
<br />2) The candidate with more "n"'s in his name wins.  If neither has an "n," then the one with more "r"'s wins.
<br />
<br />By both counts, fate dictates that it's Kerry's day tomorrow....
<br />
<br />Of course, by #2, Gore should have won against Bush. Of course, he actually did. But he would have lost in 2004 -- perhaps against McCain?
<br />
<br />If Kerry wins, he's in trouble in 2008 against McCain or Gulliani.  But if he doesn't, Hillary Clinton takes 'em both!
