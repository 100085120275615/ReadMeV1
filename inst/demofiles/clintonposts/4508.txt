<p>Hiya. We have successfully achieved Phase One of Lifeplan B, Section 5.0.8. In the event your partner of 11 years decides that life has just gotten too lifey and has a fun little time with a 19 year old, perform the following activities:</p><ul><li><div>See a high-priced high-flying divorce attorney in a snazzy building downtown who has an assistant that will bring you water.</div></li><li><div>Find a nice older lady with in-home day care 2 minutes from your work. Try to wave bye bye to daughter as she completely ignores you and lunges at a 3 year old.</div></li><li><div>Find your estranged husband an apartment. Help him pack up his stuff to go to a single friend's place until said apartment is ready.</div></li><li><div>Get counseling recommendations, call health insurance, arrange date and time.</div></li><li><div>Shit or vomit every 2 hours or so. Especially charming during 2 full day manager meetings.</div></li></ul><p>So, we're onto Phase Two right now: 1) just how in the hell do we save our relationship and b) what if we can't?</p><p>It's all so complicated. I will just tell all you people two things:</p><ol><li><div>Iron out all your couple shit (or as much as possible) prior to having a kid. It doesn't go away. It just gets heightened.</div></li><li><div>I think MySpace may be a very bad place for any men who are in relationships to be. As part of all this current fun I'm having, I have personally heard from at least four people whose relationships have been impacted in some way by MySpace. I'm not blaming MySpace for my husband's issues, but I know that it didn't help things.</div></li></ol><p>I have decided that I have shared everything about being pregnant, having a problem delivery with necessary surgical correction, and raising an infant. I don't think this should be any different. If&nbsp;this could happen to Ant and I, I know it must happen a lot. Ant said if someone asked him a year ago if he could ever have done this, he would have said no way. There's a whole chapter on &quot;transitional affairs&quot; in the book my friends gave me. So, I decided I'm going to blog about it.</p><p>Hello, I'm Shannon and I love my husband but right now I hate him too.</p><p>So, last Thursday morning I wake up and Ant's not home. He goes out every Wednesday night. It's new comic book day. It's not the weekend so we won't have plans together like parties or family stuff or whatevs. Wednesdays we agreed were Ant night outs. Except Thursday morning he's not home. And I have to go to work. He doesn't answer his cell, the friend doesn't answer her cell, so I start calling ERs and the county jail. He finally gets home at 9. I leave immediately. I don't even want to look at him. I stop for coffee and he calls me and tries to get me to come home, but I don't want to. I make him tell me what happened over the phone. It's some kind of making out/finger banging/partial blowing scenario. Neither of them came. I'm now in Bill Clinton territory. I guess that makes me Hillary. Wheee. So I go back to the house, pack up my kid, and just book it. I call Ant's mom. I call my mom. I alert the media (not really).</p><p>I stay with my parents for the next three days, seeing lawyers, talking about everything, getting day care and counselor recs from the mamas list. My parents' house is very quiet except for really loud clocks and their refrigerator contains only corn dogs, eggo waffles, and pickle relish. They help me immensely. I am a force of forward motion.</p><p>Friday night I see Ant at Central Market so he can see Zoe. It's totally dramatic and I feel like he's acting like he's in a movie. I'm sickened. There are people outside dancing. Pregnant couples and people I imagine are good husbands. I'm angry and disgusted and just. so. done.</p><p>The next night Ant calls me sobbing, wanting some promise that I'll work on things and not just kick him out. I find out later that he's seen the girl again that night, a repeat of the semi-sex. I tell him I can't promise anything.</p><p>Sunday I help him pack up so Z and I can sleep in our own beds. He heads to his friend's house. The next day he comes over to get the money his parents sent and I help him get a bank account. At the bank we talk about everything and a lot more stuff makes sense and something just happened where I felt like it didn't have to be totally over. I make him dinner and he gives Zoe a bath and puts her down and then goes home. I feel hopeful.</p><p>I make it through the next few days on fumes. I feel ill. Physically. All my anger has turned into sad and I don't have it to propel me anymore. When I see Ant at the counselor's Thursday my first thought is that I like him.</p><p>During the session I think a lot of good stuff came up. I especially think the counselor's idea about us as an overfunctioning underfunctioning couple is really helpful. And then Ant lets out that he's seen the girl since the incident. In fact, he saw her the day before. He tells me that he wants to come home, that he feels too lonely to be on his own, he doesn't trust himself not to go see her, and when he does he hates himself. I'm completely shocked by this. This means that not only did he see her the time when I told him I'd most likely be divorcing him, but he also saw her after the really good day where we connected and had things to say and I had hope. This hurt more than anything that I have ever felt.</p><p>I just wanted him to come home. I hate him and he's a mess and I'm really angry, but I can't not like him. I feel ashamed that I like him. Like an idiot. I just know that he's not this person. For 10 years he was not this person, and then I had surgeries and we had a baby and he got lost somewhere along the way. I think some people when they have a kid realize that they are going to need to grow up really quickly and accept this huge responsibility. In Ant's case, he just did worse and worse at handling it.</p><p>There's any number of reasons why Ant did what he did. And only he knows. I know I'm going to need a lot of understanding of all his motivations if I'm going to be able to accept this. Him simply saying he's sorry and he doesn't love her and he wants to be with me is only a small part of the equation. I'm going to need to know all the whys.</p><p>I go back and forth all the time. I think the person that I wish I was would just be done. Move on, cut ties, leave it at that. But the person I actually am sees something in Ant, something in myself when I'm with Ant, that makes me truly happy. I just have to decide how much ugly I can go through to get back to there, or if we even will. A lot of it is really up to him spending the time to really figure it out. Until then all we can do is take care of our kid and keep talking.</p>
