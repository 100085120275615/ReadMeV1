<span>ATTENTION ALL VOTERS! ATTENTION ALL VOTERS!</span>
<br />
<br />Below is a list of US Senators who voted for their shamnesty travesty, a bill that is UNIVERSALLY reviled in the electorates they claim to represent, and everywhere.  Anyone who is concerned about the unchecked flood of illegal aliens across our borders, and who thought our elected leaders in the Senate will actually FIX the problem, need to take notice of these names.  The Senate bill is a clear disaster for our country, and completely against the desires of everyone except the Senators and their campaign contributors.<br />
<br />All Senators who voted for this sell out - there just isn't any other word for it - <strong>
<span>MUST be defeated in their coming elections in '06 and '08.</span>
</strong> Anything that the 'esteemed' Democrat Senators from Mass., NY, Wisconsin, RI, MD, CA, and WA agree on MUST be bad for us all. The fact that McCain and Spector are for it on the Republican side is just as big an indicator!<br />
<br />The vast majority of the US is very much FOR the House bill that would seal our borders FIRST and foremost. Closing the border is step one, but eliminating the demand by enforcing our current immigration laws is also required if we want to do this the SMART way.  Then we can decide what to do with the criminals who broke our laws coming here.<br />
<br />I post this list here and will be reposting it often in the hopes that it will assist others who wish to hold these Senators to their votes, their explanations ought to be interesting during the campaign.<br />
