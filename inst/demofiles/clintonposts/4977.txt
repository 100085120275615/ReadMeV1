<span><span><span>I started writing this post almost a week ago... and I've been sitting on it, no excuses. Life around here hasn't been really hectic as much as unpredictable and uncertain but all good. So, to catch up I'll make a quick top ten list of the things I've been doing since I last posted (I know...I am definitely the worst blogger on the block!!!). Here it goes:<br /><br /><span>#1</span> We had the fortune of having my friend May visit from NYC last week for 4</span></span></span><span><span><span> days!!!  May and I have been friends for a long time, and when we became friends in Guatemala (about 12 years ago) we were attached at the hip! Then I went </span></span></span><span><span><span>away to college and years later she moved to NYC. She visited me once in Chicago an</span></span></span><span><span><span>d I</span></span></span><span><span><span> visited her a couple of times in New York. But I hadn't seen her since I got married (she couldn't make it to my wedding and I was very sad about it... when she called me the night before the wedding I ended up crying after we hung up. Ehem...I'm still a little bit sensitive about that) except for last year that Alex and I met her for dinner one day when we were in NYC.  And she hadn't met Tino yet. So it was the first time in a very long time that I got to spend so much time with her. I was a little bit nervous at first, because, you know?, people change and stuff and what if now we had nothing in common and all that. But,</span></span></span><span><span><span> as A</span></span></span><span><span><span>lex would say, we still 'clicked'. Yes, our lives are very different but we are still the same at the core. She's become a gorgeous, strong and independent woman, she's still one of the smartest people I know and I realized that she still is one of the people whose opinions I val</span></span></span><span><span><span>u</span></span></span><span><span><span>e the most in my life. And can I just say that she has the best smile? So, here are some pics, so you can meet her. Here she is with a chicken hat at Lynn's Paradise Cafe (doesn't she look fetching?)<br /></span></span></span><br /><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4020/1959/1600/may_chick.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4020/1959/320/may_chick.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><span><span><span>and then the both of us at Palermo Viejo (a restaurant in my neighborhood).<br /><br /><br /></span></span></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4020/1959/1600/mery_may.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4020/1959/320/mery_may.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><span><span><span><span>#2</span> I've been watching the World Cup (of course) and let me tell you, everything that's happened it's been my fault! When Italy and Ukraine played and Italy won (and the day before Germany had won over Argentina) I was complaining on how predictable this World Cup was, and how boring, and how Brazil was going to beat France and England was going to beat Portugal, and the final would be Brazil against Germany...blah, blah, blah. HA! See? And what happened? A slap on the face! That's what!!!! I jinxed it, for everybody!!!! Poor <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/player/161454_BECKHAM_David.html">Becks</a>, had to go home a looser. I took a nap during the second time of the Brazil-France game but when I woke up Alex and Tino were upset (well, just Alex) and they "didn't want to talk about it"...so I guess I also sent <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/player/92699_RONALDO.html">Ronaldo</a> and <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/player/3243_RONALDINHO.html">Ronaldinho</a> home. So now I'm afraid to make any comments but I really hope France wins because I would like for</span></span></span><span><span><span> <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/player/163331_ZIDANE_Zinedine.html">Zidane</a> to retire a champion... there I said it.<br /><br /><span>#3</span> Tino got a new haircut and he looks so cute and mischievous!!! It's like having a completely different boy. Although I do miss his 'lady hair', like Rachel calls it. But he looks so cute, see for yourselves.<br /><br /><br /></span></span></span><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4020/1959/1600/tino_hair.0.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/4020/1959/400/tino_hair.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a><br /><span><span><span><span>#4</span> I've been eating my weight in chocolate...because that's what unpredictability and uncertainty will do to you, even if it's all good.<br /><br /><span>#5 </span>I've rekindle my love of knitting and I've been knitting maniacally for the past couple of weeks. May brought me a really cool hat that she wants me to knit a copy of, so I'm super excited about that. I'll have pics of my current and future knitting hopefully tomorrow.<br /><br /><span>#6</span> Oh! I won the <a href="http://backtack.blogspot.com/">Back Tack III</a> thingy!!! Yeayyyyy! Thank you so much for all the people that voted for my softie! A couple of days ago I got my award goodies from Wee Wonderfuls and oh my God!!! The <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/178/991/1600/harriet%20-%20wee%20wonderfuls.jpg">softie</a> that I got is sooooo wonderful!!! Cute to boot and clever and I also got <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/2006/06/im_for_sale.html">her first booklet</a> with the softies pattern (which Tino keeps on thinking is a story book and continuously picks it up and brings it to me so I can read it to him). Thanks so much to <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/wee_wonderfuls/">Hillary</a> for the goodies and <a href="http://craftapalooza.typepad.com/crafted/">Nicole</a> and <a href="http://sixandahalfstitches.typepad.com/">Allison</a> for organizing the BT3 and to all the voters for the encouragement! Muy agradecida, muy agradecida y muy agradecida!<br /><br /><span>#7</span> I haven't been reading my daily dose of blogs and I'm missing everybody but I'm hoping to go back to a normal blog-reading routine soon. So, if you are reading this: Hi Didine!!! I've missed you too. And Ashley G.: HAPPY BIRTHDAY, a whole 12 days late! (I'm such a jackass!) You are truly one of the coolest and most talented people I know (even if I only know you in blogland).<br /><br /><span>#8</span> I bought myself a pair of <a href="http://shop.crocs.com/pc-16-4-cayman.aspx?reqid=16&reqProdTypeId=41p&amp;subsectionname=footwear&section=products">Crocs</a>, and I know everybody is sporting them now a days but let me tell you, they are sooooo comfortable!!! And cool and bright colored. I got myself a pair of the red ones, but I think I want more, more, more! Actually I think the whole family should get them. And they are so reasonably priced. So, do your feet a favor and go get them some Crocs.<br /><br /><span>#9</span> and <span>#10</span> I guess I haven't been doing as much as I thought. But I have been thinking about doing stuff, so that should count for number 9 and 10. And I know I've promised myself to be more constant with the blogging but every time life throws me a curve ball the determination goes out the window. But I have to admit that after writing this I realized that blogging is kind of soothing and cathartic, sort of blogging as therapy, so I should keep that in mind next time I fall into a blogging slump. That's more realistic. Happy to be back though!<br /></span></span></span>
