<div>You really have to enjoy watching these out of control Democrats and how they choose their battles. What kind of dithering idiots would dismiss WMDâS, the global war on terror, Muslims who hijack planes, chop off heads and focus all their attention and Election Day rhetoric on Wal-Mart? I find this to be just incredible.<br />
<br />A recent New York Times article pointed out how Democrats have declared their party to be the enemy of the big-box store. Senator Joe Biden, the buffoon Democrat from Delaware, delivered what the Liberal Rag (NYT) called a "blistering attack" on the company at an anti-Wal-Mart rally in Iowa. Joe Lieberman, Ed Lamont, John Kerry and Teddy Kennedy all have joined in on the Wal-Mart bashing band wagon. What would these blue blood limousine Liberals know about Wal-Mart? I can just picture these snobs pushing their sticky shopping carts through their local Wal-Martâ¦all the while dodging overweight ladies wearing hair curlers and food stained sweats who scream at their uncontrollable kids.<br />
<br />Making the electoral cheese even more binding with its normal Democratic hypocrisy was the First Lady 'Wanna-be' Theresa Heinz's attack on how Wal-Mart âdestroys communitiesâ which apparently never stopped her from selling her ketchup there by the truck loads or owning $Millions in Wal-Mart stock. Similarly, Hillary Clinton who served on the board of directors up until the 1992 presidential elections - returning campaign donations she received from the evil retailer. If the retailerâs policies are so out of the so called âmainstreamâ, how come it never occurred to her until now to protest and make such a big deal of it? These phoney Liberal Icons are so transparent and hypocritical, yet theyâre placed on pedestals by the Liberal loving Main Street Mediaâ¦and all of you misinformed Liberal loving people out there buy it lock stock and barrel.<br />
<br />It is stated that more people shop at Wal-Mart every week (127 million) than voted in the 2004 presidential election. According to the company Web site, âThey are disproportionately low-income folks who, by some estimates, are collectively saving hundreds of billions of dollars by shopping thereâ. What in the world is wrong with that scenario? It sounds to me theyâre the poor and abused American people who the Democrats champion for in their never ending saga of promoting class warfare.<br />
<br />Now, Wal-Mart is planning to provide the inner-city poor the same billions in savings it has delivered to suburban and rural areas around the entire country. This would create more jobs for the inner-city poor than it supposedly destroys in the process. It would also be a shining example of the free market competing with government welfare and entitlement programs. But the unhinged Democrats are standing in the way because Marxist labor unions hate Wal-Mart's policies and the unscrupulous union bosses arenât getting their slice of the Wal-Mart money pie. All a rationional thinking person has to do is open their eyes to see it for what it really is. <br />
