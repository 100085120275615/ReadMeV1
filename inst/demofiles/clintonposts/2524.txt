<br />But we went to the UN<br />
<br />President Bush, Prime Minister Blair and their supporters frequently point to the timing of the DSM and other leaked documents and say, "but we went to the UN--that proves we wanted a peaceful solution."<br />
<br />First, we should note that for Blair, going to the UN was an imperative. As a party to the International Criminal Court, the UK needed a legal justification for invasion, and regime change was not adequate, as is indicated by several of the leaked UK documents. However, both Blair and Bush needed the imprimatur of a UN resolution to build public support.<br />
<br />As Peter Ricketts' memo to Jack Straw on March 22, 2002 states, the UN strategy was twofold: "either Saddam against all the odds allows Inspectors to operate freely, in which case we can further hobble his WMD programmes, or he blocks/hinders, and we are on stronger ground for switching to other methods." But the plan backfired--Saddam did let the inspectors back in, but after visiting over 100 sites multiple times they found no WMD. They did find some conventional missiles that exceeded set restrictions on range--still no threat to the US or UK--and they were promptly destroyed.<br />
<br />With the basis for war evaporating with each passing day, Bush went back to the UN to try for a second resolution that would rubber stamp his invasion plan. When it became clear he didn't have the votes, Bush pulled the inspectors out and invaded anyway. The exercise at the UN was a sham. The DSM clearly indicates the policy of invasion was set long before the US went to the UN (and before Bush sought approval from Congress for the use of force against Iraq). The other leaked UK memos show a British Cabinet scrambling to find a legal basis for a war their Prime Minister had already committed them to. When the UN ceased to offer any further benefit to the war agenda, the US and UK moved on--to Baghdad.<br />
<br />What?Congress had access to the same intel as Bush and they approved the invasion<br />
<br />On October 10, 2002, Congress voted to approve the use of force against Iraq. The President has indicated on several occasions that members of Congress had access to the same intelligence his administration had, and made their choice on the basis of this information. What is less known is the fact that what Congress was given bore little resemblance to the detailed reports the Bush administration was reading.<br />
<br />Senator Bob Graham, in his book, recounts a Sept 5, 2002 meeting he and Senators Durbin and Levin had with then CIA director George Tenet and his staff. Though the administration had long before decided on invasion, to the senators' amazement no National Intelligence Estimate for Iraq had yet been produced. Graham, Durbin and Levin demanded to see one, and three weeks later Tenet produced a 90-page document rife with caveats and qualifications (though these were buried in footnotes) about what we knew--or didn't know--about WMD in Iraq.<br />
<br />That report was classified, and as such was available only to those on the House and Senate intelligence committees. Graham pressed for it to be declassified, and got what he asked for on Oct 4--less than a week before Congress was to vote on the use of force. However, this declassified version was more like a marketing brochure: 20 pages in length, slickly produced with splashy grahics and maps, and with none of the caveats contained in the original. Graham described it later as "a vivid and terrifying case for war."<br />
<br />This 20-page, unqualified summary was the only information on WMD our senators and representatives had on which to base their decision on the use of force. And they had one week to make up their mind. The intelligence material Congress had was what the administration was willing to give them, namely a promotional piece whose lies of omission outweighed what was included by a factor of four.<br />
<br />What?The issue of why we went to war is moot<br />
<br />We can all agree that a stable Iraq is the most desirable outcome, and indeed the US should do whatever it can to make this a reality.  But this is an entirely separate issue from the question of why we went to war and how the case for war was made.<br />
<br />There is ample evidenceâin the DSM and elsewhereâthat the administration misrepresented the nature and extent of the threat posed by Saddamâs Iraq, that the case for war was built on this misrepresentation, and as a consequence many tens of thousands of people (Americans, Iraqis and others) have lost their lives.  Every time someone is killed or injured as a result of the ongoing violence in Iraq, it becomes moreânot lessâimportant that we understand why and how we went to war.  If we were misled, as it now seems impossible to deny, then the people who misled us must be held accountable for their deception.<br />
<br />Information that is now publicly available, such as the DSM, makes it at least possible that a crime may have been committed by the Bush administration.  To say that the issue of why we invaded Iraq is irrelevant because itâs in the past is akin to saying that the specifics of Watergate became irrelevant when Richard Nixon resigned.<br />
<br />What?The information in the DSM is not ânewsâ<br />
<br />True, much of the information contained in the DSM has been reported elsewhere, so in that sense it is perhaps not a âsmoking gun.â  This, however, does not diminish the importance of what the memo reveals.  When viewed in contextâas we have attempted to do with DowningStreetMemo.comâthe DSM paints a damning portrait of an administration artificially pumping up its case for war while at the same time disingenuously asserting its desire to avoid it. It is also highly credible, as it is the official record of the Prime Minister's meeting and not the more easily dismissed recollection of a former White House official.<br />
<br />What makes the DSM so vital from a news perspective is:<br />â¢ The source â short of a similar document on the US side, there isnât a much<br />    more credible source than the British Prime Minister and his senior staff.<br />â¢The timing â the fact that the meeting in question took place in July 2002<br />    illustrates just how early on Bush had made up his mind to âremove Saddam,<br />    through military action, justified by the conjunction of WMD and terrorism.â<br />â¢The ânutshellâ â in a few sentences, the memo summarizes all of the key<br />    components of Bushâs deception: that Iraq posed an imminent threat to<br />    the United States, that the US was willing to work with the UN on a diplomatic<br />    solution, that war was a last resort, but if undertaken that the legal basis for it<br />    was sound, and that the aftermath of an invasion, if necessary, would<br />    be managed responsibly.<br />
<br />More recently, mainstream media outlets have balked at the suggestion that they missed the story. Editorial pages have been filled in recent weeks with claims that "everyone knew" the administration had made up its mind to go to war, even in the summer of 2002. If that was the case, one has to ask why no reporter ever challenged the President on the many occasions between July 2002 and the start of the invasion when he claimed not to have come to a decision on war.<br />
<br />What?Americans knew the case for war was thin from the outset, but supported the invasion anyway, and confirmed this by reelecting Bush in 2004.<br />
<br />Let us assume for the moment that Americans had the benefit of a truly fair and balanced news media from which to gather information and form an opinion on the necessity of war.  The DSM makes it clear that there were some things that the public did not know and could not have known (e.g., the National Security Councilâs unwillingness to work with the UN).  There were other things too that were presented by the administration in such a distorted way as to render them useless to even the most engaged American citizen in forming an opinion on the necessity of war.<br />
<br />The non-existent connection between Saddam and al Qaida, for example, was cited so many times by the administration that at the height of prewar hysteria, well over half of Americans polled believed Iraq was involved in the 9/11 attacks when in fact Iraq had nothing to do with them.  (Sadly, many people still believe this.)  Similarly, claims about Iraqâs WMD capability featured regular invocations of âmushroom cloudsâ when there was in fact no evidence on which to base such claims.<br />
<br />What we now know is that the conflation of Saddam, WMD and terrorism was in essence a marketing strategy, a preconceived justification for a preconceived war.  As early as July of 2002, the President and his administration had not only decided to invade Iraq in order to depose Saddam, they had also determined how to enlist the support of the American people by playing on their worst fears.<br />
<br />Bushâs reelection came well before the release of the DSM, so it is impossible to know what itâs impact might have been on what was a very close election.<br />
<br />What?The DSM doesnât tell us anything we didnât already know.<br />
<br />For those of us who saw through the Bush administrationâs house of cards before the invasion, the DSM doesnât really offer anything we âdidnât already know.â  However, its provenance and its comprehensive yet straightforward representation of the administrationâs Iraq policy present the facts in a much more compelling light.  It also represents hard evidence of the administrationâs willful misrepresentation of its own policies.<br />
<br />The DSMâs importance lies not so much in what it says but who said it.  This is not âsour grapesâ coming from ousted White House officials with a bone to pickâit is the official record of a meeting held by the USâ staunchest ally.  The DSM may not tell us anything already think we knew, but it does offer hard evidence that the Bush administration misled the country into war.<br />
<br />An excellent piece on this very subject can be found here: "Some questions for media dismissing Downing Street Memo as old news."<br />
<br />What?The DSM is just one aideâs impressions of what was said in a meeting, so we donât know what the players actually said or thought.<br />
<br />This argument seeks to discredit the documentâs accuracy by suggesting that it represents one personâsâpresumably erroneousâimpression of the meeting. Wrongâthese are minutes, and they were circulated after the meeting to all who took part. However, given numerous opportunities to refute or clarify any of the memoâs contents, none of the players has done so. Not the British government, the Prime Minister, or any members of his cabinet. In fact, at a joint appearance, neither British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw nor US Secretary of State Condoleeza Rice refuted any aspect of the memoâs legitimacy or accuracy.<br />
<br />Interestingly, White House Press Secretary Scott McClellan has moved from refusing to comment on the memo at all, to calling the memo âflat out wrongâ to, most recently, avoiding any direct commentary on its veracity.<br />
<br />What?The issue of manipulation of intelligence has already been settled.<br />
<br />This is, quite simply, false.  The Presidentâs commission on intelligence did not address the issue because it was not authorized to do so under its charter.  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence was originally going to investigate how intelligence was used but, under White House pressure, scaled back its inquiry to deal only with âintelligence failuresâ in terms of how the information was collected, not how it was used as a basis for war.<br />
<br />What the DSM clearly states is that the head of British Intelligence believed that the Bush Administration was using its intelligence to support a course of action rather than determining a course of action based on the intelligence.<br />
<br />What?Many other nations, France included, believed Saddam had WMD, so this was not a justification cooked up by the US/UK. <br />
<br />While itâs true that many governments suspected Saddam had WMD, there was no agreement as to what his actual capabilities were, or on what to do about it.  Further, simply believing something to be true does not make it so, and certainly does not form a basis for war.<br />
<br />The administration never had a âsmoking gunâ to prove Saddam had WMD, and in fact the intelligence supporting the administrationâs view was alarmingly thin.  As we now know from various reports, US intelligence affirming WMD frequently came from paid informants who, in some cases, were later proven to be fabricators.  There was virtually no intelligence coming out of Iraq itselfâthe country was impenetrable, leaving the US and others with little in the way of credible sources.<br />
<br />That President Bush believed Saddam had WMD is not in dispute.  The issue is whether he was justified in taking the nation to war on the basis of his beliefs, absent any hard evidence (like pictures of missiles in Cuba, to take a historical example).<br />
<br />It is also worth noting that while there was a range of opinion (and widespread error) as to Saddamâs chemical and biological weapons capability, there certainly was not a consensus. On the issue of nuclear weapons is a different story the US and UK stood nearly alone in their dire assessment.  It was also on this issue that the administration demonstrated its carelessness with intelligence by claiming that Iraq had sought nuclear material from Niger.  The fact that the President made this claim in a State of the Union address is all the more troubling, especially given that the same statement was pulled from a speech he gave just a few months earlier. <br />
<br />What?Regime change was already US policy before we invaded Iraq--President Clinton did that when he signed HR 4655, the Iraq Liberation Act, in 1998. <br />
<br />The Iraq Liberation Act expressed the Clinton administrationâs support for democratic opposition groups inside Iraq and authorized a variety of mechanisms by which to provide that support.  These included military assistance in the form of supplies and training.  However, the final section of the act expressly limits the administration to just these forms of military support.  From this we can safely assert that the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 provided no policy precedent for invasion, air strikes or any use of American military force.<a href="http://www.afterdowningstreet.org">downing street memo</a>
