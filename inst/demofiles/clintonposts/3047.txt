<div>Following is a comment I sent to Arianna Huffington's blog site (huffingtonpost.com) after listening to her speech at the Take Back America Rally on C-Span. The encouraging thing about Arianna's speech was her criticism of Senator Hilary Clinton. A day or two before seeing the speech, I mentioned to my wife that my problem with the political machine is everyone criticizes the other camp while ignoring the stupidity of their own comrades. It was so refreshing to see a Democrat criticize one of their own. Republicans such as John McCain seems to be one of the few Republicans with the balls to criticize his fellow party members. <br />
<br />On May 25, 2005 I accompanied a group of about 45 pastors, ministers, deacons, and laity to Capitol Hill to speak with Republican Senators and Congress Persons about the devastating affect the President's proposed budget cuts will have on the largest part of our society. The working poor and the lower middle class. One republican senator told me that he completely supports the President's budget but his office admitted that his constituents do not. Political careers and quid pro quo are more important to some politicians than the will of their own constituents.<br />
<br />Anyway, here's my message to Arianna because it was a perfect example of what I am looking for in the political arena:<br />
<br />
<br />Arianna,<br />
<br />I am watching you right now on C-span at the Take Back America rally.<br />
<br />I finally found a Democrat who deeply impressed me.    You!  The problem I have with the whole political associations is this: Republicans criticizing Democrats and ignoring Republican screw ups and Democrats criticizing Republicans while ignoring Democratic stupidity.<br />
<br />Your criticism of Senator Hilary Clinton's "existential" response to an exit strategy was perfect.  That is where we need to be to take back America.  On principal and religious conviction, though, I cannot in clear conscious support a candidate who pledges the continued government sanction and subsidy of abortion. [Government subsidies of immoral behavior make taxpayers party to the immorality by coercion. Real Christians are opposed to abortion on more than one level. Making us guilty of it is just one of them.] <br />
<br />Being a Black American, I cannot justify supporting a party which establishes its ideology on a "medical" procedure in which 11-14% of the population is getting 44% of the abortions. The party which is better for the economy and social issues endorses the genocide of my people. <br />
<br />With Healthcare costs escalating in all other medical procedures, why does abortion remain affordable for poor people?  Why does being a Democrat have to mean that more unborn Black babies get to die at a medical discount? And why do taxpayers have to foot the bill making them culpable in a culture of death?<br />
<br />The morality issue, you say, is about economics and I agree.  So why are taxpayers with contradicting religious convictions and values forced to conspire in such immorality?<br />
<br />I represent a political awareness effort called Conservative Black Voices.  The name of the effort doesn't mean that I am anti Democrat, gay, death mills as a matter of political association.  As a matter of right and wrong which still exists and a matter of theological absolutes which have never failed I am opposed to footing the bill for immoral, evil, and spiritually criminal behavior.<br />
<br />Is anyone going to grow some balls and care about people without condoning their wrongdoing?  Loving and caring doesn't mean agreeing with wrong.  Loving enough to disagree without abandoning is true service and compassion.  That is what public officials are for-service.<br />
<br />Once again, I finally found a Democrat (Progressive or not) deeply impressed me.  Maybe others will come around and learn from you who have proven not to let friendship get in the way of absolutes and exposing the evil.<br />
<br />Message to Arianna Ended<br />
<br />Don't get me wrong. I disagree with Arianna on critical issues. My point is that what I saw in her today is the number one step in the right direction. When people in the political parties, national committees, and power positions in Congress and the Senate grow enough balls, integrity, backbone, and nerve to call the people of their own parties on the carpet then we will be well on the way to take America back from politicians who have no compassion, care, or concern for âwe the people.â</div>
