<span>Some of you may have noticed some perspective issues in this blog, so now the Mrs. and I are giving this one up. She has moved on to Lehigh County Redneck, I will be moving on to Musings from Mudville. This way, she can do her "Ann Coulter, Hillary Clinton" thing, and I can do my "James Carville, Paul Begala" thing. It will still be fun, just different names, and no more arguments over content! </span>
</span>
<span>See you real soon!!!!</span>
