<span>, you'll be able to see the comments, which has this eye opener (for the GOP at any rate!):</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>"Iâm so disgusted with the republicans that for the first time, I will not vote for them. Until they offer someone with at least the illusion of our best interests at heart, Iâm going to stay at home or vote for someone thatâs got a pair who hasnât a chance to win. </span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Yes, I know that no vote is a vote for dimmocraps, but maybe a mass exodus from the RINO party will shock them into actually doing the peopleâs will."</span>

<span>I feel your pain.</span>

<span>One thing I love about being a conservative is our freedom to criticize when it is needed.  And right now, the GOP just doesn't need criticism, it needs a huge slap in the face to WAKE UP!!!!  I'm teetering on the brink of either not voting in the coming congressional elections or voting for a Democrat, just to send Republicans a big old message!  At the very least, I'm going to pay CLOSE attention to who is running, and see where they stand on border security and illegal immigration.  </span>

<span>is looking pretty good right about now for president in 2008.  I'd vote for Hillary (gag!), if I actually thought she'd do something about the borders.  (Of course, she's already contradicted herself on this issue, so we can expect nothing on that front).</span>
