<br />The big international news story in the papers today was that President Bush, after meeting with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, announced a plan to beef up U.S. military presence in Baghdad, bringing the number of forces deployed in the Iraqi capital to about 11,000 from about 7,000.  The President said, "obviously, the violence in Baghdad is still terrible, and therefore there needs to be more troops.  Our military commanders tell me that this deployment will better reflect the current conditions on the ground in Iraq."  The additional troops will consist mainly of military police who, along with their Iraqi counterparts, will focus on neighborhood-to-neighborhood searches for insurgents.<br />
<br />The big domestic news story in the papers today was that the Senate, ina 65-34 vote, passed a bill making it a federal crime to take an underage girl across state lines to have an abortion procedure performed in order to avoid parental notification laws - punishable by a fine and up to a year in jail.  President Bush said, "transporting minors across state lines to bypass parental consent laws regarding abortion undermines state law and jeopardizes the lives of young women."  And Democratic Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York - who voted against the bill - said, "life is not always the way we wish it to be.  Sometimes tragedies happen, and sometimes families are not just negligent but abusive, and sometimes young girls are taken advantage of by members of their family, people in whom they should be able to trust."  The bill has to be reconciled with a House measure (which requires out-of-state doctors to provide 24 hours' notice and allows parents to sue doctors who perform the procedure) passed last year before President Bush gets to sign it into law.  <br />
<br />The Baghdad story is big because the announcement comes about a month after President Bush flew to Baghdad to meet the newly-elected Prime Minister and praised him for his plan to take control of Iraq and shows that whatever the Prime Minister's previous plans, they haven't worked out too well.  Also because the additional troops sent to Baghdad will not be coming from the U.S., but from where they are currently deployed: Anbar Province, the home of the Iraqi insurgency.<br />
<br />The Senate/abortion story is big because, at the same time they passed this law, a proposal to focus on sexual education and create new pregnancy prevention grants was defeated by a 51-48 (party line) vote. <br />

<strong>SO IF YOU MISSED IT:</strong>
<br />The Bush Administration, in an attempt to "better reflect the conditions on the ground" are basically re-arranging deck chairs (played by U.S. military personnel) on the Titanic (played by the, ahem, nation of Iraq) and Senate Republicans don't care if young girls are educated about their bodies and how to avoid unwanted pregnancy, but will throw those girls' grandmothers in jail for driving them across state lines for a safe, legal surgical procedure.</div>
