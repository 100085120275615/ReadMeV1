I used to think that eyeliner was eyeliner. Then I used a supercheap <a href="http://www.newyorkcolor.com/">NYC</a> pencil, the tip of which I had to warm with a blow dryer just to get it to show up on my lid without pushing so hard that I took out an eye. As it happens, all eyeliner pencils were not created equal.</p>

<p>So far, the best eyeliner pencil I've used is <a href="http://tartecosmetics.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=eyeliner&Category_Code=E">Tarte Cosmetics Eyeliner</a> (try Waterlillies, a dark charcoal shade). It glides on almost effortlessly, dark and true without having to apply much pressure at all. It also seems to stay put quite well, but that might just be the <a href="http://tartecosmetics.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=cleanslate&Category_Code=F">Tarte Clean Slate Primer</a> I've been using with it.</p>

<p>Hillary has been <a href="http://jackandhill.typepad.com/jack_and_hill_a_beauty_bl/2005/07/tarte.html">a Tarte fan from way back</a>, but I've just started playing around with their stuff this week. So far, I've loved everything I've tried - more on which later. </p></div>
