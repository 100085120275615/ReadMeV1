<span>Virginia Virtucon</span> has been alerted to some very disturbing statements made by Democrat U.S. Sen. candidate <span>Jim Webb</span>.<br />
<br />
<span>Webb</span> allegedly called some of his playmates "Mr. Poopy Pants" and "Doody-Head" on the playground when he was age 4. While the "Poopy Pants" comment is obviously insensitive to those suffering from colon problems, there are some who have claimed that the "Doody-Head" name is a negatively-charged epithet. I am simply shocked that there could be such a deep-rooted antagonism in this man towards anyone, but obviously his recent history in the Dem primary race against <span>Harris Miller</span> illustrates that not much has changed over the decades.<br />
<br />I trust that the Mainstream Media will be on top of this story non-stop for the next several weeks with front-page articles and editorials, the same way they so strongly condemned U.S. Sen. <span>Joe Biden</span> (D-Del.) for his comment that, "<a href="http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/7/7/115513.shtml?s=ic">You cannot go to a 7-Eleven or a Dunkin' Donuts unless you have a slight Indian accent</a>" and U.S. Sen. <span>Hillary Clinton</span> (D-N.Y.) for her remark that Mahatma Gandhi "<a href="http://www.indiacause.com/newsletters/nL_040107.htm">ran a gas station down in St. Louis</a>" or when U.S. Sen. <span>John Kerry</span> (D-Mass.) <a href="http://www.khalistan.com/CongRecords/CR031704_Burton_KerryShould">referred to India's Sikhs as terrorists</a>.<br />
<br />I weep for our nation that this man, <span>Webb</span>, could have made it this far in life with such heavy baggage.<br />
