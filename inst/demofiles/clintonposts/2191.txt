<em>âFor freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slaveryâ (Galatians 5:1, English Standard Version).<br />
</em>

</em>
<br />We are in the home stretch of our study of Galatians. Chapters 5 and 6 comprise the practical application and exhortation section of the letter. Paul has spent four chapters expounding doctrine and theology, and now wants to draw the application to our daily lives. This is common in almost all of Paulâs letters: Doctrine first, then life application. I know many of us (myself included) are thinking, âLook Paul, we know youâre fired up about theology, but can you just boil all of this down into a nice package of doâs and donâts?â Well, we all need to be fired up about theology. Not to the point where we all decide to go to seminary, but we all need to know what we believe. We canât behave right unless we believe right. Right action always flows from right belief.<br />
<br />So, with that being said, letâs look at the text. There are five points I want to draw from this text in regard to our freedom in Christ (which is the main theme in Galatians): 1) The purpose; 2) the author; 3) the action; 4) the exhortation; and 5) the warning.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. The Purpose</strong> <em>(âFor freedomâ)</em>. One of the main purposes for that radical thing Christ did on the cross was to secure our freedom. Well you say, âI live in the USA, Iâm already free.â No, Jesus didnât go to the cross for political freedomâas important as that is for some of us. What kind of freedom are we talking about? Weâre not talking about personal freedom, political freedom, economic freedom, or even religious freedom. The freedom we have in Christ, the freedom he went to the cross to secure, is spiritual freedomâfreedom from the sin that held us captive and ensured us a one-way ticket to hell. In verse 5:13, Paul says we were called to freedom (âFor you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one anotherâ). But he qualifies this freedom. Itâs not the freedom to do whatever we please, but the freedom to finally live as God designed us to live.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. The Author</strong> <em>(âChristâ)</em>. Christ is the author of our freedom. As I said earlier, he did the work that secured our freedom. In Acts 13:38-39, Luke (the author of Acts) tells us that through Christ we have forgiveness, and through our faith we are freed from everything (âLet it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.â). Furthermore, what Christ did is something the Law of Moses could not do (sound familiar?). No other person could do what Christ did. Not Abraham, Moses, nor Elijah; not Confucius, Buddha, nor Mohammed; not Joseph Smith, Mary Baker-Eddy, nor Benny Hinn; not Michael Moore, John Kerry, nor Hillary Clinton. Do you get it? Only Jesus! Jesus is the God-man who alone died to satisfy the wrath of a holy God and thereby guaranteed our freedom.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. The Action</strong> <em>(âHas set us freeâ)</em>. What Christ did was a very specific thing. God couldnât just declare us free, or that would violate his justice. It wasnât the miracles of Jesus or the teachings of Jesus that set us free, but his death on the cross. There is a movement within liberal Christian circles that denies the death, burial and resurrection of Christ. They say the story of Jesus is allegorical. The story is meant to show that we must be willing to die for what we believe is right. RUBBISH! Christ died so we would be free. I love what it says in Revelation 1:5 (âTo him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his bloodâ). We were freed from our sins by his blood. Blood is a reference to death (cf. Hebrews 9:22). Notice further that this phrase is in the past tense. What Christ did was a once-for-all-time act. We are free men and women of Christ. Jesus doesnât have to do anything more to free usâthe deed is done. All that is left is for us to live like it.<br />
<br />
<strong>4. The Exhortation</strong> <em>(âStand firm thereforeâ)</em>. This leads me into my next point. The Bible frequently exhorts Christians to stand firm. Weâre not exhorted to sit, flee, or charge forward. We are to stand firm. This is a command to be resolute in our faith. There are going to be many things that will seek to draw us away from our faithâfrom our freedom. Paul exhorts us to resist and stand firm. Look at verse 5:7 (âYou were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?â). The imagery here is of a runner who was doing well in a race until he gets tripped up. Paul was saying to his readers that they were running well (standing firm) until they were hindered. What were they hindered by? Verse 5:6 tells us (âFor in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through loveâ). They were hindered by their slavery to religious ritual. This is not Godâs will for us to be in bondage. These things ultimately lead us away from the joy that is found in Christ. The exhortation: Stand firm!<br />
<br />
<strong>5. The Warning </strong>
<em>(âDo not submit again to a yoke of slaveryâ)</em>. When we are not standing firm in our freedom, we are submitting to a yoke of slavery. Now I could ask you, âWould you be willing to go back to a yoke of slavery after having been set free from it?â Our answer would be a resounding NO! But hold on a minute. The desires of the flesh are not so easily withstood. Itâs a difficult thing to resist the flesh and its desire to enslave us. In the movie Shawshank Redemption there was an old man who had been in prison over 50 years. When he was finally set free, he couldnât handle not being in prison and ended up killing himself. That desire for our spiritual prison cell lies within all of us. But we are FREE! Do not submit!<br />
<br />
<strong>Application Time.</strong> This passage of Scripture is very practical, so the application is easy. We are free in Christ. We need to live that truth out in our lives. We need to make sure we donât confuse freedom with license. We are not free to sin; we are free from sin. Secondly, we need to stand firm in our freedom and resist the desire to return to our former slavery. Look at verses 5:2-4 (âLook: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you. I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law. You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from graceâ). Christ canât help us if we refuse to embrace our freedom. Jesus unlocked and opened wide the cell door of our lives. Itâs up to us to walk out and grasp our freedom. If we refuse to leave the cell, we reject our only means to salvation and freedom.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bottom Line. </strong>The Apostle Peter aptly summarizes our thoughts with this: âLive as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of Godâ (1 Peter 2:16).<br />
<br />Have a blessed day!</div>
