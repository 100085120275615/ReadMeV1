<div>The Hotline today has a look at what polls looked like 3 years before the last few Democrat and Republican primaries.  <br />

<br />WH '00 GOP Primary Averages<br />Colin Powell 29%<br />George W. Bush 17<br />Jack Kemp 13<br />Elizabeth Dole 11<br />Dan Quayle 10<br />

<br />On the Dem side, '04 serves as the best example of tainted primary polls ('00 also proves the point, but '04 does it more obviously).<br />
<br />Jan. through August '01 Polls<br />WH '04 Dem Primary Averages<br />Al Gore 41%<br />Hillary Clinton 19<br />Joe Lieberman 9<br />Bill Bradley 8<br />Dick Gephardt 7<br />John Kerry 4<br />John Edwards 2<br />Bob Kerrey 2<br />
<br />The '96 nat'l GOP primary numbers based on '93 polling shows the correct frontrunner pick but...<br />
<br />WH '96 GOP Primary Averages<br />Bob Dole 31%<br />Colin Powell 24<br />Jack Kemp 16<br />
<br />So why do people spend time and money polling a race that may never happen? On the off chance it does, these numbers suddenly become very important. Of the candidates that were in the lead of their respective primary polls three years before the election, among those who actually ran (not Powell -- either time) no one failed to get their party's nod in the years we looked at -- Dole in '96 and Gore in '00. (And at some point Bush in '00 once Powell was not included in the primary matchups.) Although the "among those who a actually ran" is a large caveat. With no one on either side fessing-up to a WH bid yet, the primary polls become a Choose Your Own Adventure for politicos.<br />
