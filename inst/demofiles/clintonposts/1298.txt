He said Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York is clearly the early favorite, but will face a strong challenge from Russ Feingold of Wisconsin. He was the only senator to vote against the original Patriot Act, and he has always opposed the war in Iraq, Nero said. So he'll get an early boost from the crowd that opposed Sen. Joe Lieberman. But that will actually help Clinton because a challenge from the left will frame her as a centrist. She'll win the nomination and select Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois as her running mate.<br /><br />A woman and a black? Isn't that risky?<br /><br />Not really, Nero said. Most of the country is beyond that, he said. He also said that the strongest Democratic nominee would be Sen. Evan Bayh of Indiana. He's experienced. He's not seen as a polarizing figure, and he has consistently won elections in a red state. He could win Ohio in addition to Indiana, Nero said. You have to figure out what states a nominee can win.</blockquote>In baseball trivia, today in 1961, Roger Maris became the first major league baseball player to reach 50 home runs in the month of August.<br /><br />Be sure to check out this <a href="http://www.jewishsoftware.com/products/Voices_For_Israel_885.asp?bhcd2=1156266052">CD</a>.
