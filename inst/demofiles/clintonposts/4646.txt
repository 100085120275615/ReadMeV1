<p>Last night's discussion at Drinking Liberally naturally took a turn talking about Ned Lamont's candidacy, and what makes Joe Lieberman a "bad" Democrat. Putting aside Lamont for a moment, let's take a look a Joe Lieberman. The first response from most people would be, "he was for the war in Iraq." While this is undoubtedly true (Lieberman continues to be hawkish on the war), that alone would not put him in the "bad" Democrat category. After all, such Democrat luminaries as John Edwards, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton and Diane Feinstein <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=107&session=2&vote=00237">also voted for the joint resolution.</a></p>

<p>And it's also true that Lieberman's postion on such issues as the environment hasn't been too bad (the League of Conservation Voters gave him a score of 70 (an 88 during the 107th Congress, and a 56 during the 108th), but have him absent of several crucial votes such as human pesticide testing, environmental funding, and CAFTA (download the entire report <a href="http://www.lcv.org/images/client/pdfs/LCV_Scorecard_05_FINAL_lores.pdf">here</a>).</p>

<p>On the issue of abortion, he has consistenty taken a pro-choice stance, while at the same time supporting legislation that would require parental notification. More recently, he has been quoted as <a href="http://www.nhregister.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=16292372&BRD=1281&PAG=461&dept_id=31007&rfi=6&xb=notig">being in favor of denying rape victims emergency contraception:</a></p>

<blockquote>U.S. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, who often takes a conservative line on social issues, is facing a liberal Democratic primary challenge from wealthy Greenwich businessman Ned Lamont. But that hasnât stopped Lieberman from supporting the approach of the Catholic hospitals when it comes to contraceptives for rape victims.

<p>Lieberman said he believes hospitals that refuse to give contraceptives to rape victims for "principled reasons" shouldnât be forced to do so. <b>"In Connecticut, it shouldnât take more than a short ride to get to another hospital," he said.</b></blockquote></p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with being a pro-life Democrat, as long as he or she consistently votes to uphold a woman's right to choose--underscoring the idea that the government should simply stay out of personal, private matters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.commondreams.org">Common Dreams</a> take Lieberman to task in  the areas of social and economic justice. In 2000 when Lieberman was running for Vice-President, Suzanne Gordon and Isabel Marcus <a href="http://://www.commondreams.org/views/090200-103.htm">wrote:</a></p>

<blockquote>Lieberman's own contribution, in the 1960s, to the civil rights movement and his more recent support for reproductive choice reflect this proud tradition. The rest of his record on Capitol Hill, unfortunately, represents almost a complete negation of the social justice agenda pursued by so many American Jews for the last century.

<p>Lieberman has an ambiguous record on affirmative action and support for public education. He favors big military spending increases and partial privatization of Social Security. He is for "tort reform" - a special-interest scam that will further reduce the public accountability of big corporations by limiting damage awards against them in lawsuits filed by victims of occupational or environmental hazards.</p>

<p>When challenged in the past - from religious quarters - about his positions on abortion or birth control, Lieberman has often used biblical references and Talmudic interpretations to explain and defend his public stands. One wonders what sections of the Bible or Talmud he is relying on to justify being a wholly-owned Senate subsidiary of drug and insurance companies, military contractors and the nuclear power industry - all of which contribute heavily to his campaign coffers?</p>

<p>But Lieberman's corporate connections pale in comparison with his disturbing pronouncements on the role of religion in civic life and his close alliances with fundamentalist Christians. Rev. Jerry Falwell - whose views are so embarrassing to the Bush campaign that he was sidelined at the recent Republican convention - expressed great joy over Lieberman's candidacy. And, in an op-ed in the New York Times, Sen. Sam Brownback (R., Kan.) hailed Lieberman as his "ally" because "we share a belief in universal truths, in a moral order ordained by God and discovered, not created, by man.</blockquote></p>

<p>I think what has finally pushed Lieberman into the "bad Democrat" category is that he has become the Republican's go-to guy. Chris Anderson at <a href="http://interestingtimes.blogspot.com">Interesting Times</a> I think <a href="http://interestingtimes.blogspot.com/2005/03/joe-lieberman-fox-news-democrat.html">said it best:</a></p>

<blockquote>Any political party should look askance at any of its members when they become the person that the opposition party likes to push as their go-to guy. <b>Being a favorite Democratic guest of the conservative pundit pap shows is as clear a sign as any that that Democrat is viewed as a convenient chump for the Republican cause.</b>

<p>Joe Lieberman is just such a chump.</p>

<p>It's not a question of whether Lieberman means well or isn't ideologically pure enough. <b>It's simply a fact that the Democrats are worse off, as a party, for having Joe as one of their primary spokesmen.</b></blockquote></p>

<p>Lieberman consistently spouts Republican talking points on <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2006/02/11.html#a7116">TV appearances</a> and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/03/joenertia_ii.html">in print.</a> Like Atrios <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2005_03_13_atrios_archive.html#111085331564841542">said,</a></p>

<blockquote>It's okay to criticize your own side, and it's okay to have some independence. What isn't okay is attacking your own side in a way which benefits the other guys, especially when it's most of what you do.

<p>It's a big tent, but not big enough for the Fox News Democrats.</blockquote></p>
