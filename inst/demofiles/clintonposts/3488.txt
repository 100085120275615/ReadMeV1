<div>Rasmussen did a <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2005/Republicans%202008.htm" target="_blank">survey of 310 Likely Republican Voters</a> about their preference for the 2008 Presidential Nominee. Rudy Giuliani (26%), Condi Rice (24%), and John McCain (21%) were the clear front-runners, between them capturing 71% of the vote. Newt Gingrich came in fourth with 7%, and Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist came in fifth with 5%. Chuck Hagel, George Allen, and Tom Tancredo were also included, but they did not hit 5%. If the big three chose not to run, Not Sure took the nomination with 30%. Gingrich was first with 27%, followed by Frist at 11%, with George Pataki, Allen, and Sam Brownback trailing in the single digits.<br />On <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2005/Democrats%202008.htm" target="_blank">the other side of the aisle</a>, the Democrats seem ready to anoint Hillary Clinton (shudder), as she garnered 43% of 326 likely Democrat voters. 2000 loser Al Gore followed with 14%, 2004 VP loser John Edwards took 13%, and 2004 loser John Kerry took 10%. If Clinton and Gore did not run, Democrats seem poised to lose again with 2004 loser John Kerry taking 38% of voters, and his  losing running mate John Edwards taking 28%. 1988 primary loser Joe Biden took 6%, as did 2004 primary loser Wesley Clark. New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson (who hasn't lost, yet) took 5% of voters. Perhaps the three best chances for Democrats to win the White House failed to garner over 5% of the vote, namely Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack, outgoing Virginia Governor Mark Warner, and quasi-moderate Senator Evan Bayh (D-IN). Russ Feingold was also included, but did not fare as well as his campaign-finance reform bed-buddy did in the Republican polling.<br />In other Rasmussen news, the <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/Bush_Job_Approval.htm" target="_blank">President's approval rating</a> is at 46% for two days in a row. Ladies and gentlemen, we have liftoff. Most important, his strongly disapprove rating is back out of the 40s, which shows he has wooed back those conservatives <a href="http://stillangryblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/et-tu-w.html" target="_blank">who were pissed about Miers</a>.
