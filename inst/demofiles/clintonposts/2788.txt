<div><p>Slow day = light-hearted news <a href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2006/5/prweb391395.htm">story</a>.</p><blockquote><p>A new behavior prediction tool is forecasting a landslide victory for former Democratic Vice President Al Gore in the 2008 presidential election. However, should Hillary Clinton gain the Democratic nomination, any potential Republican challenger will win the presidency.</p>

<p>These are among the surprising findings reported by Dr. James N. Herndon, a media psychologist with Media Psychology Affiliates. Using a new research tool called Affective Encryption Analysis, Dr. Herndon led an investigation into the likely outcome of the 2008 Presidential election.</p>

<p>âAffective Encryption Analysis is a new behavior forecasting tool that looks at how our feelings and emotions can influence our long-term actions,â explains Dr. Herndon. âTraditional survey techniques are not very good at predicting trends. Affective Encryption Analysis was developed to dig deeper into the emotional factors that control our future behaviors.â</p></blockquote><p>Of the results, Dr. Herndon had this to say:</p><blockquote><p>âDespite the widespread public dissatisfaction with the George W. Bush administration, our results showed even greater ill-feelings toward potential Democratic challengers,â says Dr. Herndon. âBut there was one exception: Al Gore.â</p>

<p>âWith a predictive accuracy of 93%, our results showed that Al Gore would easily defeat any Republican challenger in 2008. However, he is the only Democrat on the scene today who has the ability to defeat the likely Republican challengers, who we believe will be either John McCain or Jeb Bush.â</p>

<p>Results were not rosy for Hillary Clinton. âHillary Clinton would suffer a disastrous defeat at the hands of any Republican who receives the nomination,â states Dr. Herndon. </p></blockquote><p>Sorry for the excessive quoting, but I'm feeling fairly lazy today.&nbsp; As for the results from this predictor, I can't be to enthusiastic.&nbsp; Heck, a football game actually <a href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/ballot/redskins.asp">predicted</a> the 17 presidential elections prior to 2004 correctly.&nbsp; Anyway, enjoy the rest of the holiday.</p></div>
