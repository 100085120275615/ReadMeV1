<div>Liberals surrender. That's how it works, apparently. A group of liberal PAC leaders had some <a href="http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=597">nice things to say about Jonathan Tasini</a> and his positions off the record, but on the record they weren't willing to go after Mrs. Clinton.<br />
<br />MoveOn.org, who claims responsibility for a great deal of the liberal pushes since 2004, <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/15/183124/258">won't stand behind Tasini</a>. Liberals are scared. Why? Why won't these "principled liberals" stand up to Hillary Rodham Clinton for her stances they disagree with? Why are they afraid of Mrs. Clinton? They can break her just as they broke Lieberman in his primary, they have the money floating around to do so. Why are they so afraid to stand by their principles and support the unpopular candidate who actually stands for their views? It's disappointing to think that those on the opposite side of this spectrum are too afraid whereas us here on the right stand up to those within our parties with a vengance. See Rhode Island's Senate race, see the US Senate race in New York, see the power of Mark Harris in PA, etc, etc, etc.<br />
