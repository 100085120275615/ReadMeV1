<br />4) <a href="http://www.mitchhedberg.net/">Mitch Hedberg</a> was a genius, and it's a fucking shame that he's dead. I first saw him on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6029452902646144512">Letterman</a> and just about pissed myself laughing. <a href="http://ba.manilasites.com/">B.A.</a> recently linked to <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mitch_Hedberg">this page</a> of his quotes. Click the link and piss yourself.<br />
<br />5) In other news, I'm making my delicious barbecued country style pork ribs for supper, the kid and I went to a great children's theater production of <span>The Wizard of Oz</span> this morning, and my cat has a urinary tract infection and is leaving stinky little puddles all over the house. I might kill him.<br />
