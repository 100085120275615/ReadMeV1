There a also a large number of former US Army top brass.<br /><br />Mr Blair has been keeping quiet about his plans after his departure from Number 10 - which could be as early as 2007 according to some Labour insiders.<br /><br />But sources in the City have revealed that he is "seriously considering" a high-profile role with Carlyle - which manages $30billion (Â£20million) of investments worldwide.<br /><br />The job could net Mr Blair up to Â£500,000 a year for only a few days work a month giving speeches and making "networking" trips on behalf of the company.<br /><br />The move comes after it emerged that the premier's financial affairs are in an increasingly perilous state His dream home has crashed in value by Â£700,000 in just seven months and he and Cherie have to find Â£13,000 a month for the mortgage.<br /><br />The Â£3million loan the couple took out to buy the house in London's Connaught Square is 17 times Mr Blair's current salary.<br /><br /><div>[End of Fair Use Quote from Sunday Mirror]]<br /><br /><br /></div>   <span> But Who Pays His </span><span><span><span>$22,000 A Month Mortgage?<br /></span><br />Carlyle is the former financial home of George Bush, Sr. and a number of Bin Laden family investments.<br /><br />Upon George Bush Senior's forced retirement from the presidency, he became Carlyle's ambassador plenipotentiary to the top officials in all the countries he'd visited as U.S. president, giving Carlyle immediate entree for its desired investments as well as enormous cachet to match its vast cash. It is the top private equity investment firm in the world.<br /><br /><span>A job offer from Carlyle at U.S. $855,000 a year --for just a few days work a month--might just turn the head of a previously modest Labour Party official and lawyer. Would it turn the official's head far enough to buy an otherwise unjustified military invasion of Iraq?</span><br /><br /><span>Hamer reports that Blair's new U.S. $5,130,000 house is 17 times his yearly salary of approximately $25,000 a month, and he is scrambling to make the $22,000 a month mortgage payments.<br /><br />Poor dear. He could hold rent parties or take in boarders to make the mortgage but surely President Bush's Dad would float Tony a loan to cover his monthly payments until he's on board at Carlyle. After all, Blair did go to the trouble of invading Iraq just to keep young George company, and what's a $264,000 a year loan among friends?<br /><br />If Blair put the usual ten percent down on his 5 million dollar house, he would have plunked down $513,000 in cash. Dare we ask where that came from? The families of the dead British soldiers certainly should.<br /><br />Didn't glorious young George have lots of loose millions in cash lying around in Iraq? Perhaps he gave Tony a tip off the top? Thats the least he could do when he refused Blair's pleas to sign the Kyoto Treaty or to make a substantial contribution to Blair's povery fund.<br /><br />But Bush does believe in rewarding loyal friends, as long as it doesn't damage his standing with his neo-conservative pals and as long as it doesn't come out of his his own pocket. Didn't Bush hand out a few billion in non-bid contracts to his friend Cheney's Halliburton firm as well as to several Carlyle owned defense contractors? That money came from the US tax payers and Iraqi oil profits.<br /><br />But what the hell is the head of the British Labour Party doing with a five million dollar house and a $22,000 a month mortgage? Why is the head of the British Labour Party, the ruling British prime minister, taking a job with the wealthiest capitalist investment company in the world?<br /><br />Carlyle, which owns many defense contractor companies, has made billions off the Iraq war. Did it first buy off the British Prime Minister with a job offer to smooth the way toward Britain's active participation in the invasion, even though Blair and all his advisors knew the factually unjustifiable invasion was illegal?<br /><br />Will we next learn that Bill and Hillary Clinton have been on the Carlyle's payroll as well? That might explain their odd enthusiasm for "staying the course to accomplish the mission" in Iraq.<br /><br /><span>Exactly What is the Remaining Mission in Iraq?</span><br /><br />The remaining mission in Iraq obviously does not include ferreting out weapons of mass destruction. All Bush's carefully chosen expert ferretors, who ferreted to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars, had to admit that there were no weapons of mass destruction to be found in Iraq.<br /><br />The remaining mission in Iraq obviously does not include removing Saddam as a threat to us and his neighbors. He is in jail and on the fast track to being executed before he can tell how much help, and what chemical and biological weapons he was given for his fight with Iran, by that now cannonized saint of Washington National Airport and the Republican Party, President Ronald Reagan.<br /><br />And for heaven sakes don't let Saddam bring up George Bush Senior's treasonous manipulations to forestall Iran from releasing the American hostages before the November election. That stopped President Carter's re-election. It was just pure luck that Iran released those hostages on the very day that Reagan and Bush Senior were sworn into office.<br /><br />Then of course, Saddam must be convicted and killed before he tells all he probably knows about the details of Bush Senior's involvement in selling weapons to our terrorist enemy, Iran, so he could funnel the profits to the right wing Contra's to fund their illegal war against the duly elected Sandinistas government.<br /><br />But who cares about that old Iran-Contra business anyway? People have long forgotten that Congress specifically prohibited our government from giving funds or aid the Contras. Most of those who were convicted for their illegal smuggling or perjury, were pardoned by Bush Senior. Now many of those same criminals have been re-hired to prestigious jobs in the current Bush administration. The Bush family is truly loyal to the crooks who serve them. Karl Rove needn't worry a bit.<br /><br />Well, we've now learned that for several years prior to the 2003 Iraq invasion, Saddam was too busy writing romance novels to organize any threats against the US or his neighbors, and, besides, he didn't have any of the necessary weapons. Isn't it a shame that the CIA's intelligence on Iraq was so bad?<br /><br /><span>We'll Fire Our Nukes on Iraq, to Stop Nuclear Proliferation</span><br /><br />Saddam's neighbor and old enemy, Iran, is severely threatened now -- by us, or more properly by Bush and his band of rogue neo-conservative terrorists -- who are threatening to attack Iran with "tactical" nuclear weapons no less.<br /><br />Or, if it seems more politically expedient, Bush will allow Israel to carry the nuclear bombs to Iran. Don't worry, it will all appear to be perfectly legal. To justify their pre-emptory attacks on Iran, Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld will stage....<br /><br /><br /><span><span> Yet Another Fake Pearl Harbor?<br /><br /></span><span><span><span>A recent British publication reported that Vice President Cheney had directed the Pentagon to prepare plans for an attack on Iran if the US was the target of another terrorist attack, whether or not Iran had any connection to the terrorist attack. (And whether or not it was a "real" terrorist attack or one Cheney cooked up to look that way).</span><br /> <br /> <span>[ Funny, I thought our founding fathers only gave war powers to the president. I guess Bush hasn't read that far in the Constitution or maybe he likes having his co-president Cheney do all that annoying reading and, while Cheney does all the hard work, like starting wars, Bush can go blissfully off on his bike rides and five week vacations.]</span><br /> <br /> <span>As I write, while Bush "vacates" in Crawford and hides from Cindy Sheehan, Cheney is busy making plans for the imposition of martial law on the country "if there should be another terrorist attack". Cheney really means "when he orchestrates the next fake terrorist attack, not "if".</span><br /> </span><br /></span></span></span></span></span><span><span>Right on point are several American news reports relating the Pentagon's extraordinary demotion of a four star general who only has a few months before his retirement date.<br /><br />The Associated Press reports that General Kevin Byrnes was "relieved of his duties" because he had unpermitted telephone communications with a civilian woman to whom he was not married, while he was separated from his wife and awaiting the final divorce decree. There was no suggestion of sexual harassment complaints against the General, and the telephone calls in question were apparently mutually consensual.<br /><br /></span></span><span><span>General Byrnes was one of only eleven four star generals in our military.<br /><br />The Pentagon probably spends half a billion dollars or more training and grooming a four star. It wouldn't toss that investment out lightly, and certainly not for the military equivalent of failing to walk within the white lines of a pedestrian crossing. The General was not even alleged to have known the woman in question while he was still living with his wife.</span><br /></span><span><span><span><br />Another American website report (www.arcticbeacon.com) makes more logical, if much more terrifying, sense: General Byrnes, in charge of all the military Training and Doctrine programs, was demoted because he had interfered with the execution of a Cheney plan to use a live nuclear weapon in a training exercise which would intentionally be detonated in Charlestown, South Carolina attributed to terrorists, Iranian terrorists. The nuclear detonation would be blamed on Iranians terrorists, thus giving the US and Israel legal justification for an immediate nuclear attack on Iran.<br /><br />General Byrnes was in charge of the "nuclear terrorist attack drill" to take place in Charleston, South Carolina in August.<br /><br />There is also an assertion that General Byrnes was part of a group of Army officers who were actively working to prevent the Pentagon's neo-conservatives from starting a nuclear war on Iran which would might cause a general global conflagation.<br /><br />If this story is true, my deep thanks to General Byrnes and all those working with him. Your actions, along with those of Cindy Sheehan and all her supporters, may help us to stop this mad cabal of war mongers and profiteers.<br /><br />If the story about the General Byrnes interfering with a faked nuclear terrorist attack has truth to it though, I wonder how the General avoided assassination long enough to be officially demoted.<br /><br />Byrnes has not made any public statements. I pray he lives long enough to tell his tale in sworn testimony to a joint session of of Congress. That's what it may take to wake our Congressional delegations and our citizens to fact that Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld are quite prepared to re-enact the horrors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on US towns just so they can justify nuking Iran to control its oil.<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.prisonplanet.com/articles/august2005/020805nukeiran.htm">Maybe its just pure fantasy</a> that Cheney is planning to fake a terrorist attack and to nuke Iran. But what worries me is that Cheney's statements concerning the nuclear threat presented by Iran are so very, very similar to his statements about the non-existent weapons of mass destruction and nuclear program in Iraq. It appears quite likely that like the 9-11 attacks which set the stage for the Iraq invasion, Cheney would welcome a terrorist attack if it meant he could permanently change Iran's regime by "tactical" nuking of all its leaders around Tehran and points north, while leaving its southern oil fields uncontaminated so they could be seized.<br /><br />See Greg Syzmanski for <a href="http://arcticbeacon.com/articles/article/1518131/31291.htm">details. </a> [Warning: I just saw a web note saying that Syzmanski makes up stories, but who can tell fiction from fact with this insane administration?]<br /><br />Footnote 1: The story of Cheney's planned fake nuclear attack for 2005 brings to mind the questions many of us had about whether the Bush administration had prior knowledge of the 9-11 attack and just let it happen. Now I wonder if they had that foreknowledge of the 9-11 attack because they engineered it.<br /><br />Syzmanski <a href="http://www.lewisnews.com/article.asp?ID=106623">quotes</a> a former Vietnam War and Pan Am pilot who flew the same planes that crashed into buildings on 9-11:<br /></span></span></span> <p><span class="regular"></span></p> <blockquote>   <p><span class="regular">Concerning 9/11, Wittenberg knew right off the bat the hijackers - who couldnât handle a Piper Cub - couldnât fly the âbig birdsâ he flew for so many years, knowing the planes were also incapable of performing such high speed maneuvers as the government claimed. </span></p>   <p><span class="regular"> </span></p>   <p><span class="regular">He also knew the possibility of jet fuel bringing down the towers made no sense. ["Jet fuel burns cold, not hot", he said.] In fact, he knew the whole 9/11 story made about as much sense as crossing the Atlantic in a row boat...* * *<br /></span></p>   <p><span class="regular">Knowing the flight characteristics of the âbig birdsâ like the back of his hand, Wittenberg convincingly argued there was absolutely no possibility that Flight 77could have âdescended 7,000 feet in two minutes, all the while performing a steep 270 degree banked turn before crashing into the Pentagonâs first floor wall without touching the lawn.â </span></p>   <p><span class="regular"> </span></p>   <p><span class="regular">Wittenberg claimed the high speed maneuver would have surely stalled the jetliner sending it into a nose dive, adding it was âtotally impossible for an amateur who couldnât even fly a Cessna to maneuver the jetliner in such a highly professional manner, something Wittenberg said he couldnât do with 35 years of commercial jetliner experience.</span></p> </blockquote>footnote 2: I watched a tall building being imploded in Honolulu years ago. I repeatedly watched a video of the collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 which was not hit by any airplanes and suffered no fuel explosions. Building 7 collapsed as neatly into its own footprint as the professionally set detonation of that Honolulu building. Odd.<br /><span><span><span><br />footnote 3: Another web site linked to Syzmanski's asserts that the outing of Valerie Plame was not a personal attack on her career, but was the intentional destruction of the CIA front company where she worked and the undercover status of its many operatives around the world. It states that the leaking of Plame's undercover role at the CIA's energy company was devastating to the CIA's capacity to track nuclear weapons, and may have resulted in the deaths of some of its agents or sources.<br /><br />The site suggests that knocking out all the CIA's surveillance capabilities on nuclear weapons components, especially those known to be badly secured in Russia, allowed Israel's intelligence operation, Mossad, to be the only source of information on their location at any given time. Mossad's control over the all information about the Russian nukes would allow them to claim a nuke had been stolen by Iranian terrorists. The intentional detonation of a similar nuke on US soil could then be attributed to the Iranians, providing the US and Israel with the preferred legal justification for the immediate nuking Iran.<br /><br />Footnote 4: This article rings true concerning the substantial consequences suffered by the CIA as a result of illegal disclosure of Valerie Plame's identity as an undercover CIA agent. The Appellate Court's opinion upheld the appealed order to journalist Judith Miller to testify before the grand jury concerning information she received from a putative confidential source concerning the identity of Ambassador Joseph Wilson's wife, Valerie Plame, as a CIA operative on nuclear proliferation issues. The Appellate Court emphasized the seriousness of the crime, which had to mean its adverse impact on the CIA and its other proliferation agents.<br /><br /></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Democracy Means that He Who Stuffs the Most Votes in the Ballot Box Wins, No?<br /></span><br />The remaining mission in Iraq isn't to establish a democracy. Bush dispensed with democracy when he successfully stole two presidential elections in the U.S. His luck was not as good in Iraq. Even though he loaded his chosen election candidates with money, media coverage, intelligence, his candidates lost badly.<br /><br />But even without the benefit of the easily altered electronic voting equipment, Bush's boys gave it the old college try. They simply extended the vote counting for a few days to allow them to manually fix the vote totals so that the winning party didn't carry a voting majority of the total, and had to enlist allies to carry to the day. But even with the vote fixing, Bush soon lost control of the constitutional drafting process.<br /><br />The winning Shi'ite fundamentalists are now in the process of approving the theocratic constitution they drafte which enshrines Islam as the official state religion and the basic source of law, putting Islamic Shar'ia rules in force as the determinant of family and domestic law.<br /><br />Shi'ite Iran, which trained and protected Iraqi Shi'ite mullahs during Saddam's anti-Shi'ite, anti-clerical regime, will be delighted. As the apt saying goes, " Bush went to war on Iraq -- and Iran won." And Iraqi women lost.<br /><br /><span>Occupation Subverts Iraqis Women's Rights<br /><br /></span>Even before Islam becomes the official state religion and source of law, women are being attacked in the streets, even in the Universities, for not wearing scarfs or otherwise dressing and acting as mandated by the Sadr Shi'ite mullahs. Acid has been thrown in the faces of the non-compliant. Women fear to stand for election because targetted assassination is a distinct possibility.<br /><br />[There were more homicides in Iraq this past July than there were in the all of New York City for the year 2004, so homicide, targeted or otherwise, is a distinct possibility for all Iraqi citizens.]<br /><br />Women can no longer walk to work, school or shopping alone, not only because of fear of the Shi'ite extremists, but because the rate of rape and kidnapping is so high. Bush has failed to provide even minimal civil security from crime; such crime control as there is is being carried out by armed party or religious militias.]<br /><br />Well, Bush never said that accomplishing the mission in Iraq meant preserving women's rights -- to dress as they wish, to go to work, school or shopping without a male relative as chaperon, to marry, to divorce and to obtain custody of their children. Perhaps when the religious extremists begin chopping off the fingers of women who wear the forbidden nail polish, Laura Bush and Cherie Blair will take an interest.<br /><br />The civil rights that women had under Saddam's secular regime, however despotic in other respects, produced more highly educated, employed women than anywhere else in the Middle East. Now access to higher education and employment for many women will no longer be possible.<br /><br /><span>The Real Reasons for the Invasion of Iraq</span><br /><br />The only missions remaining to be accomplished in Iraq are the real reasons we invaded that country in the first place. They are the reasons Bush refuses to leave.<br /><br />He wants permanent U.S. control of Iraqi oil fields and the establishment of 14 military bases there, so US can control access to oil by other countries, especially China and Russia, and so the US can bully the rest of the Middle East into keeping their oil sales in dollars, not Euros, - following the dictates of our neo-conservative rulers. When these conditions are satisfied, we can reward our Israeli friends with an oil pipeline direct from the Iraqi oil fields to Israel.<br /><br />We haven't had the opportunityto bomb Iran and seize its southern oil fields yet, nor have we managed to change the regime in Syria to a more US-compliant ruler. Those items remain on the Bush-Cheney-Sharon "To Do" list for their mission in the Middle East.<br /><br />Thus are recited above the noble causes for which Casey Sheehan, 2000 other US soldiers and some hundred thousand Iraqis have given their lives -- and will continue to give their lives until our troops are all brought home and Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld and all their neo-conservative would-be world rulers are removed from office.<br /><br /><span>Bush Cheerleads As Our Soldiers Play for Keeps</span><br /><br />Our President Bush is so deeply endowed with "noblesse oblige" that he will manfully stay the course until the last US soldier and the last Iraqi has died for his noble cause of US control of oil resources and the 14 military bases which will provide US dominance over the entire the Middle East.<br /><br />Meanwhile the formerly Laborite Blair is going off to toil dutifully in the fields of capitalist filth for the Carlyle Group, so he can continue to pay his $22,000 a month mortgage. Is that the noble cause for which British soldiers have died, and for which more will die if their troops remain with ours in Iraq?<br /><br />We must stop this madness and restore our constitutional democracy before we are all sweating in Gulag Gitmo wondering how the hell we lost our country in five short years.<br /><br /></span><br /></span></span>
