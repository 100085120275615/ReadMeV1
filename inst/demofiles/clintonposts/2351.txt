<span>DID </span>the AIDS activists who have descended on Toronto this week want me to leave them alone this week?  I mean, really, by the way that attendees like Dalton McGuinty, <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/story/canada/national/2006/08/14/aids-bills.html">Bill Gates and Bill Clinton</a> are talking about the issue, I'm almost blushing...  Had I known that every sympathetic, compassionate and enlightened individual was in Toronto this week, I would have made it a priority to fly over there to let them re-educate me...except that thanks to Bill Clinton's disastrous mid-East policy, the skies are anything but friendly these days!<br />
<br />My good people, think about just how idiotic this whole AIDS conference is.  Here we have the Left, essentially offering us a vision of Betamax while DVDs are already sitting on the shelves when it comes to their obsession over spending millions, yes millions!, of dollars to drown Africa and every gay bar in town in condoms, all while the abstinent look on in wonder.  Suggest that teaching abstinence instead of condom usage is automatically seen as an imposition of values and not practical since no one will listen anyway.  Obviously, if AIDS is over twenty years old and still such an issue to some, maybe the whole condom fad isn't as hot as it was back in the day when pink pants on guys was cool...<br />
<br />We will probably continue to hear the moans for many more decades to come too since these activists are intent on making the world's most preventable disease not just their own worry stone but also ours as well.  Frankly, I wouldn't ever give a dollar to an AIDS foundation and no, it's not because 95% of the cases are contrived from morally wanting situations but because in a world where I can give a dollar to the old lady who is having cancer eat her body away or to the guy who just needs a hobby, I'm more inclined to go with the former.  At least the AIDS crowd understands the concept that an ounce of prevention outweighs a pound of cure, although they're also so obsessed with having their pound of flesh as well that we have to continue hearing them complain when a national leader doesn't take them seriously!  In the meantime, I hope Bill Clinton leaves the City of Toronto a little monetary gift for giving him another chance to meet thousands of ways to get Hillary off his mind...</div>
