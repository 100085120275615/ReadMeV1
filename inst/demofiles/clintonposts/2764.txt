<div><p>My good friend <a href="http://vonswainrepublic.blogspot.com/">Von Swain</a> asks if former New York Mayor Rudy Guliani would have a chance seeking the Republican nominate. I would say that he is a dark horse. Yes he is popular and runs high in the polls, but that is because he has kept very quiet the past couple of years. He is busy in New York building up his consulting business. </p>

<p>If he were to get involved with the political dialog, and start taking positions on issues (such as abortion and homosexual marriage) his popularity would fall. He couple probably unseat Hilary Clinton <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/2005/Hillary%20Meter.htm">(her negatives are very high)</a>, 43% of people recently polled say that they would not vote for her. But his ego will only allow him to get "the prize". </p>

<p>My money is on McCain.</p>
