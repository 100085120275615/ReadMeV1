<br />
<br />As much as I like Bill (which is tepid at best), Hillary is going to have to settle for VP- if anything- after this exchange;<br />

<blockquote>Sen. John Cornyn: "None of your civil liberties matter much after you're dead." <br />
<br />Sen. Russ Feingold's retort: "Give me liberty or give me death."</blockquote>
<br />
<br />In case you can't tell, Cornyn is one of those poopy-headed liberty haters that make up so much of the GOP these days. Feingold gave him the smackdown he so richly deserved.<br />
<br />Trust Russ, I say (so far anyway).</div>
