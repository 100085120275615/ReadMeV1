<blockquote><p>Catering to constituency groups rouses friction among Democrats</p>
<p>By Steven Thomma<br />
McClatchy Newspapers</p>
<p>CHICAGO - Emotions rubbed raw, Democrats clashed Friday over efforts to make the party more diverse in deference to some of its most loyal constituent groups. </p>
<p>The friction came as the Democratic National Committee&#8217;s Rules Committee debated and adopted two new proposals - one aimed at creating &#8220;inclusion programs&#8221; for gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgenders and the disabled; the other designed to enforce a new party move to give African-Americans and Hispanics a bigger voice in picking presidential nominees. </p>
<p>Both proposals were expected to be approved Saturday by the full Democratic National Committee at its summer meeting here. Despite their broad support, however, the moves exposed underlying tensions and illustrated the power that organized minority groups retain within party councils as Democrats gear up for big elections in November and 2008. </p>
<p>The first involved two of the party&#8217;s most senior strategists - Donna Brazile, who managed Al Gore&#8217;s 2000 presidential campaign, and Harold Ickes, a former top aide to President Bill Clinton and an ally of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y. </p>
<p>It centered on the proposal to make sure gays, lesbians, bisexuals, transgender people and the disabled are more involved in party business. &#8220;As already is the practice, state parties may use goals to achieve these ends,&#8221; the proposed rule says. &#8220;However, in no event may such participation be accomplished by the use of quotas.&#8221; </p>
<p>While the party has long recognized gays and related groups as an important part of its base, advocates said the new rule was needed to draw a distinction with Republicans, who propose to outlaw gay marriage. </p>
<p>Ickes questioned the need for the new program. He also openly challenged another proposal designed to assuage groups such as African-Americans by acknowledging that they have faced worse political discrimination than gays. </p>
<p>Ickes said gays would be left uncovered by the second proposed rule that reinforced the party&#8217;s commitment to affirmative action for &#8220;historically&#8221; oppressed groups, including African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Asian/Pacific Americans and women. </p>
<p>He further inflamed advocates when, speaking of the history of discrimination, he referred to the long-abandoned practice of limiting voting to property owners. Brazile and some others took his remarks as an insulting lecture. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was personally offended. I was offended as a daughter of the Deep South. I was offended as an American. I was offended as a Democrat,&#8221; said Brazile. &#8220;This borders on racism.&#8221; </p>
<p>She said later in an interview that she was furious at Ickes for using the term &#8220;property,&#8221; without recognizing that African-Americans were once considered property. </p>
<p>&#8220;I used some words that offended some people,&#8221; Ickes said after meeting one-on-one with Brazile. &#8220;I apologized.&#8221; </p>
<p>The second confrontation - notably less personal - was over the party&#8217;s plans to change the way it picks a presidential nominee in 2008. </p>
<p>Facing complaints that pivotal early primary voting has been dominated by the largely white states of Iowa and New Hampshire, the party wants to share early voting with Nevada and its large Hispanic population, and South Carolina with its large African-American population. </p>
<p>In response some states, especially New Hampshire, might move their primary dates up. To try to stop that, the Rules Committee approved a plan to punish any presidential candidate by barring their delegates from the national convention if he or she campaigns in any state that defies the party-set calendar. </p>
<p>Kathy Sullivan, the Democratic Party chairwoman from New Hampshire, said that was a mistake that would distract the party from its primary goal. </p>
<p>&#8220;The work of this committee should be to try to come up with a plan to take back the White House,&#8221; she told the committee. </p>
<p>&#8220;Instead of discussing the issues that matter to the people of this country in taking back the White House, the press will be covering . . . whether or not this committee is going to penalize some of our candidates for our presidential nomination. I find that to be a sad, unintended consequence, which will not help our eventual nominee.&#8221;
