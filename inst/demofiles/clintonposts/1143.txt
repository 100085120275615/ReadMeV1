Note the crossed fingers of the soldier's left hand. This is a sign demonstrating coercion by the enemy, taught to soldiers in case of capture, as a way of signaling that they are being forced by the enemy to say or do something that they don't actually believe. Could make for a humorous and yet impactful campaign commercial by Hillary's opponent in 2008.<br /><br />Back to the Middle East, <a href="http://op-for.com/2006/07/prepping_the_battlespace.html">Op-for.com</a> provides a detailed analysis of Israel's "prepping the battlefield" in southern Lebanon, as it gets ready to obliterate the Hezbollah force gathered there...at least that is the outcome that Israel is right now hopefully planning to achieve, and, of course, the outcome devoutly to be wished for!
