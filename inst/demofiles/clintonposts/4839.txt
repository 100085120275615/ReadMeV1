<p>This week was a bit rough for the three New Yorkers considering runs for the White House in 2006.</p>
<p>Pro-Iraq War Senator Joseph LiebermanÂs defeat could be bad news for another pro-war senator: Hillary Clinton. Although she remains the favorite for re-election the Senate this year, her presidential ambitions could falter. ÂAnti-war Democrats showed their clout in Connecticut,Â said <a href="http://thenextprez.blogspot.com/2006/08/friday-top-five-august-11th.html">The Next Prez</a>. Dismayed by Lieberman&#8217;s defeat, <a href="http://lawandpolitics.blogspot.com/2006_08_01_lawandpolitics_archive.html#115509958300422160"><br />
The Legal Fiction</a> sees it as a blow to Clinton: ÂThis was a big wake-up call that she needs to make some changes before she starts her run. Money and establishment-backing is still the most important thing, but itÂs no longer sufficient in high-profile elections.Â</p>
<p>But Michael Tomasky in <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2147566/">Slate</a> disagrees. The Connecticut election, he says, Âwas about one man and one stateÂ and anger over the notion Â that national-security ÂtoughnessÂ demands support for the mendacious and ruinous policies of the Bush administration in Iraq and elsewhere.Â</p>
<p>Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani also took some hits this week, and the criticism came over what even Giuliani haters usually applaud: his actions surrounding 9/11. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060536608/sr=1-1/qid=1155302718/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-2543718-3015118?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books">Grand Illusion: The Untold Story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11</a>, by Dan Collins and Wayne Barrett <a href="http://1fp.us/2006/08/11/giuliani-911-failure/">quotes Police Commissioner Ray Kelly</a> as criticizing GiulianiÂs decision to locate the cityÂs emergency command center next to Ground Zero and for archaic radios that kept the police and fire departments from communicating on 9/11. This comes after 9/11 Commission Chairmen Thomas Keane and Lee Hamilton indicating last week that they should have asked Giuliani tougher questions when he appeared before their panel.</p>
<p>Although Mayor Michael Bloomberg <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/442574p-372649c.html">disputed the criticism</a> of his predecessor and Ray Kelly sought to distance himself from the the latest charges, it could still put a dent in GiulianiÂs political ambitions. Columbia political science professor Steven Cohen told the <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/37786" target="new"> Sun</a> that, if Giuliani Âwants to keep a positive glowing image of himself in the public, the last thing he should want to do is run for president.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the Next Prez has a different take. It says disclosure of the thwarted terrorist plot to put bombs on planes puts Âa renewed focus on terror threats [that] could turn more voters in Giuliani&#8217;s direction, and convince more conservatives to overlook differences on social issues.&#8221;</p>
<p>And as he stumps the country, considering a possible presidential bid, Governor George Pataki could not have been cheered by Sheelah Kolhatkar&#8217;s article in this weekÂs<br />
<a href="http://www.nyobserver.com/20060814/20060814_Sheelah_Kolhatkar_pageone_coverstory1.asp">Observer </a>. Much of it is devoted to people saying how unlikely Pataki is to become president. ÂPresident Pataki Â I donÂt see that one happening,Â pollster John Zogby said. And Ross Baker, a Rutgers University political scientist, chimes in: ÂHe starts with a pretty substantial deficit&#8230;.He comes across as a rather bland person, both in appearance and demeanor.Â
