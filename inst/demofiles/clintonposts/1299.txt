<a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=051206A">Arnold Kling</a>, a conservative, on the 2006 midterms:<br /><i><blockquote>The whole oil-company-baiting, education-centralizing, entitlement-expanding, earmark-loving lot of them can be tossed out, as far as I'm concerned. Then we can start over.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi plans to use control of Congress to launch an investigation into the Bush Administration. For those of us who have not been drinking the Kos Kool-Aid, this seems like a questionable enterprise.</i></blockquote><br />Another person noting that the Republican's biggest problem in 2006 isn't going to be the War, but the rapidly rising size and cost of government, and the seemingly unabashed attitudes towards it (we're looking at you, Trent Lott).  <br /><br />The Democrats, on the other hand, are presenting themselves as the alternative, hoping for backlash alone to carry them back to power.  The problem with that is that while the Republicans seem to pay lip service to smaller, more efficient, less intrusive government, the Democrats actually seem to like the way things are now, with growing medicare and social security benefits, centralized control of education, and many more of what Bush has brought about.  <br /><br />While there are a few good Congressmen and Senators out there (Hastert, while remaing a dork, has done admirable work in the House, and there was a small contingent of Senators opposing Lott & the Democrats on the bloated Emergency Spending bill - the one that wasn't actually emergency filled), there doesn't seem to be anyone speaking out for the growing contingent of Americans who want to see Washington with less power, money and say in how people's lives are run.  <br /><br />Where's the third party promoting local control of schools, less government-funded safety nets, terrorist ass-kicking, secure borders, free trade and low taxes?  That used to be the Republican message, but it's become convoluted since 1994.  <br /><br />I think both parties are facing revolution soon.  If the Democrats seriously start going the way of Pelosi/Kennedy/Huffington/Kos/etc, they're basically giving up the middle.  Mark Warner is the horse they need to ride in 2008.  If you don't think Warner would smoke Mitt Romney in 2008, you need to rethink that.  But Hillary?  Yikes.  How do you win when half the nation hates you from the get-go?  A Warner/Lieberman ticket would pull in a lot of Republicans.  A lot.  Kos fashions himself a strategist of sorts, just looking on how to win, but his track record is horrendous.    <br /><br />The GOP, of course, isn't looking much better.  With no clear-cut leader for '08, the party faces an identity crisis.  Romney?  McCain?  Allen (my personal pick)?  Rice (we can all dream, I suppose)?  Hagel?  No clear-cut leader.  Frist?  Yuck.  And even then, we'd still have the problem of the House and Senate who think it is their job to do their damnedest to wring millions and millions of dollars out of the public treasury to build or fund truly stupid projects back in their home areas.  <br /><br />Time for revolution, perhaps?<br /><br />EDIT: It appears some Dems <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/05/the_dem_center_fights_back.html">are getting it.</a>
