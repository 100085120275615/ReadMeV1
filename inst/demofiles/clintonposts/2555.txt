In fact most people come to me for advice.  Of course they annoy the hell out of me. But what can I do?  I am smarter than most people.<div align="center" nowrap="nowrap"><a target="_blank" href="http://www.fuali.com/test.aspx?id=741516d0-8635-449e-8e7b-914071fd3d36">Take the<br />Idiot Test<br />@ FualiDotCom</a></div></div><br /><br />This is my first post in a long time, and I'm roughly 1/3 of the way through Spring Semester. I'm still up to my old tricks, though; procrastination's a bitch. I should be studying for my Human Sexuality (psych class, not a lab) midterm right now, but am busy wasting time by posting on my blog, grooming, eating, and taking lame tests. I'm dirt poor and running out of food. And toothpaste. And deoderant. Yet, this feels much more fun than improving my grades. (By the way: I did pretty well last semester. All B's, except for Art, in which I got an incomplete that I'm currently negotiating with that freakshow professor.)<br /><br />I've been avoiding the news ever since my poli-sci class ended, more or less because I was required to do so by the class and the news really bums me out. I don't think I've gotten over the election yet. I've stopped thinking, "Maybe this is just a nightmare and Kerry really won. Maybe I'll get some money back at taxes, and there will be student loan repayment programs available when I graduate, and more financial opportunities for returning students so that I'm not so damn poor." I've gotten over that part, though it took me awhile. Thank God I didn't pay close attention to the Rice and Gonzales confirmation hearings, or it's likely I would have posted earlier with seething commentary. Still, though, Thank you, Senator Boxer. You rock. And Thank you, John Kerry. Even though I liked Howard Dean better than you initially, and your electoral loss broke my heart, your courage amazes me.<br /><br />Right now, I'm reluctant to call myself a Democrat. I'm embarrassed and ashamed at how they're letting themselves be steamrolled by the Bush administration. I sent letters to my senators (Dorgan and Conrad of ND), protesting the Gonzales nomination, and their respective staff sent me back letters saying they would back it because George Bush has the right to pick whoever he wants in his new administration. They were sorry about the torture part, though. Although this should not have surprised me, since both of them are centrist Democrats and huge wusses, I'm still annoyed. Why are people letting him get away with this? Torture, for chrissake? That's even worse than all of those manufactured Clinton scandals together!<br /><br />Anyway, I'm behind the times. It's for the best, really. The news upsets my digestion, and there's nothing worse than being all farty and bloated because Rumsfeld STILL didn't get canned. My actual life is going pretty well. School is fun and engaging, my friends are a riot as usual, my car still works, and I'm about to be an Auntie. Yay! I'm wondering if it's a boy or a girl yet, and am already crocheting a baby blanket. I have also filed my Renewal FAFSA and income taxes, so I'm not going to be doing either one of those things last minute, and I found a much more promising apartment prospect than the place I'm living right now. So hopefully I can look it over and see if it's cool; if I get it, next year, I'll be able to have a cat. And I love pets.
