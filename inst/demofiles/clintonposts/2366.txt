<strong>Being a Republican Today</strong>
</span>
<span>
<br />
<br />Things you have to believe to be a Republican today.....<br />
<br />Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and HillaryClinton.<br />
<br />Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him, and a  bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.<br />
<br />Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is Communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.<br />
<br />The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.<br />
<br />A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.<br />
<br />The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops inspeeches, while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.<br />
<br />If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.<br />
<br />A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.<br />
<br />Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy, but providing healthcare to all Americans is socialism.<br />
<br />HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.<br />
<br />Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.<br />
<br />A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense, but a president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.<br />
<br />Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution,which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.<br />
<br />The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's driving record is none of our business.<br />
<br />Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers foryour recovery.<br />
<br />You support states' rights, but the Attorney General can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.<br />
<br />What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but whatBush did in the '80s is irrelevant.<br />
<br />Feel free to pass this on.<br />

<strong>Friends don't let friends vote Republican.</strong>
