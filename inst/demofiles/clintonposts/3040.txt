<div>First of all, I am not a Hillary Clinton fan.<br />I posted a photo of her along with that article, but it did not come through.<br />Hillary Clinton is not a nice person, and I personally think she is out for only herself and also that she is a she-wolf.  I believe she and Bill have some code of silence from the Main streamed Media and the Hollywood lefties to do what they please with no level of accountablilty.  With all that being said, my last post was totally tongue in cheek.  The only Hillary I am a fan of is my daughter Hillary.  <br />
<br />Me and Rich are leaving Tuesday evening for Mobile, Alabama.  We have to make it there Wednesday night.  Rich has an interview Thursday morning.  He has a phone interview either Monday or Tuesday with a company in Nashville, Tennessee.<br />He has written off the job in Georgia.  It is very puzzling, he is told he is a finalist, they also tell him the next step is a house hunting trip, and then he hears nothing from them.  We are once again scratching our heads, wondering what he might have done for the company not to communicate yea or nay.  The recruiter says he is still in the running, and she has not communicated much either. That is the last we heard, they are still making their decision.  Okay, we hope you your decision and we can say, "sorry I found something else." <br />In spite of that, we know God has a plan and it is obvious Georgia is not in the plan.<br />
<br />We are settling into our smaller quarters, and Mikey the dog is adjusting.  He gets a lot of walks and time at the doggie park.  I do think he misses the backyard and chasing squirrels.  <br />
<br />See yall next week.  If I can get a wireless connection, I will blog from the gulf coast!<br />
<br />Ola and vaya con dios!<br />
