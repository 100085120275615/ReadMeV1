<br />Sorry for the delay.  I had to take a brief hiatus for a variety of reasons - booming business, thanks to this economy - a result of bold leadership on the part of President Bush; and the need to cleanse my soul of the fowl stench of despair that had been growing due to the festering puss filled sore of liberalism that has been crippling our country for the past several years.  I had to step away, listen to some music, read a novel or two, vege on some TV and medicate my psyche with some therapeutic lawn care.  The lawn is looking great by the way.  <br />
<br />It is overwhelming sometimes to listen to the constant barrage of hate and negativity that is projectile vomited forth from the left in this country.  There seems to be a complete disconnect with reality as to what the world is facing.  The short-term memory loss is amazing, and the ability to distort, deceive and rewrite facts is nothing short of breathtaking.  This great deception is no longer an anomaly attributable to a few fringe wingnuts, but now seems to have crept into the very core of the Demoncratic party, the mainstream media, Education, Hollywood and some spineless Republicans in congress.  There is a wave of insanity that has blanketed much of our country and I truly fear for our ability to survive if it continues.  Unfortunately, it is the infected ones that have the microphone.  Too often it appears that our media would rather see our country under a Hammer and Sickle flag than the Stars and Stripes.  It feels that the level of anger, bitterness and hatred on the part of the left is at an 1860's level.  Wasn't it that political genius, Al Gore that said there were two Americas?  Well, that's probably the only thing I would agree with Gore about.  Although it's not rich and poor like old Al tried to say, it's American and Anti-American.  Yeah, that's right, Anti-American!  Contrary to the hate filled left trying to convince us that, "Dissent is patriotic", commonsense should tell us that when you want your own country to loose a war, hate and make fun of your president, publish terrorist fighting tactics with the intention of embarrassing and discrediting the administration and hurting our war efforts, put out movies and publish stories that make the US look bad and emboldens the enemy, yeah, that's anti-American.  And I am sick of it!  <br />
<br />What happened to civil discourse?  Even when the Rapist in Chief, Mega-Narcissist, Bill Clinton and the Evil White Witch, Hillary controlled the Whitehouse, conservatives were more controlled in their rhetoric.  Of course there were exceptions, but it wasn't an emotional pandemic that became a cultural chant.  Sure he was impeached but let's face it, anyone with half a brain and a modicum of sense should be able to admit that he deserved it.  And oddly enough, if it wasn't for his and Hillaryâs' stubbornness and refusal to step down like any indecent leader would have, Gore would have been president and probably would have won the election easily in 2000.  I think that is why Republicans didn't push removal in the senate.  So, thanks Bill.  But I digress.  <br />
<br />It is because of this tidal wave of acidic bile that now flows from the left in this nation that I had to take a few weeks off, concentrate on my business, and tend to my yard.  I'll try to ride the wave more often again and to try my best to honor and promote what sanity still exists in this country and to point out the insanity of the left whenever possible.<br />
<br />I will continue to pray for our country, for our governmental leaders and for the leftist haters among us, that they might see clearly some day.  I would encourage all who are Christ followers to do likewise.  Our future depends on it.<br />
<br />Now back to mowing.</div>
