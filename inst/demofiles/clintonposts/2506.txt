<br />
<br />"Ambition is one of the ungovernable passions of the human heart. The love of power is insatiable and uncontrollable."  John Adams

<br />âThe natural tendency of representative government, as of modern civilisation, is towards collective mediocrity: and this tendency is increased by all reductions and extensions of the franchise, their effect being to place the principal power in the hands of classes more and more below the highest level of instruction in the community.â  John Stuart Mill

<br />
<br />"Censorship, like charity, should begin at home; but, unlike charity, it should end there." Clare Booth Luce
<br />
<br />"It can produce cynicism if people believe that the process is merely something that has to happen; they almost become bit players in the process, arriving at decisions that are already made. I emphasise the importance of people knowing that their participation is for real, and that it can affect the outcome. We should not allow public sector managers simply to tick a box to say that they have done the participation bit; participation should contribute to the decision-making process. If it does not, we will genuinely undercut all the good things that are happening." Tony Wright, British MP
<br />
<br />"I wouldn't say voters are stupid. But the same voter who wants unlimited services also does not want to pay for it. There's a disconnect."  Phil Talmadge, former Washington Supreme Court judge and legislator.

<br />
<br />"It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: "And this, too, shall pass away." How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride! How consoling in the depths of affliction!" Abraham Lincoln
<br />
<br />"In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments; there are consequences." Robert Green Ingersoll
<br />
<br />"Experience should teach us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the Government's purposes are beneficent.

<br />"Regulations are government embedding and marbling its way into and out of successive layers of societal activity. It is government deconstructing, rebuilding, renovating and expanding a little each day. The regulatory machinery may move a little faster or a little slower, but like rust, it never sleeps."  Scott Proudfoot, Hillwatch
<br />
<br />"In order to rally people, governments need enemies. They want us to be afraid, to hate, so we will rally behind them. And if they do not have a real enemy, they will invent one in order to mobilize us." Thich Nhat Hanh

<br />"It is the characteristic of the most stringent censorships that they give credibility to the opinions they attack." Voltaire
<br />
<br />"It is always with the best intentions that the worst work is done."  Oscar Wilde
<br />
<br />
<br />"We cannot work or eat or drink; we cannot buy or sell or own anything; we cannot go to a ball game or a hockey game or watch TV without feeling the effects of government. We cannot marry or educate our children, cannot be sick, born or buried without the hand of government somewhere intervening. Government gives us railways, roads and airlines; sets the conditions that affect farms and industries; manages or mismanages the life and growth of the cities. Government is held responsible for social problems, and for pollution and sick environments. Government is our creature. We make it, we are ultimately responsible for it, and, taking the broad view, in Canada weave considerable reason to be proud of it. Pride, however, like patriotism, can never be a static thing; there are always new problems posing new challenges. The closer we are to government, and the more we know about it, the more we can do to help meet these challenges."  Canadian Senator Eugene Forsey
<br />
<br />"The idea of imposing restrictions on a free economy to assure freedom of competition is like breaking a man's leg to make him run faster."  Morris R. Sayre

<br />
<br />"Economics are the method; the object is to change the soul." Margaret Thatcher
<br />
<br />"You never reach the promised land. You can march towards it." James Callaghan, British Prime Minister 
<br />
<br />"I repeat, that all power is a trust, that we are accountable for its exercise, and that, from the people, and for the people, all springs, and all must exist." Benjamin Disraeli 
<br />
<br />"The function of government is to calm, rather than to excite agitation." Viscount Palmerston, British Prime Minister
<br />
<br />"Too bad all the people who know how to run the country are busy driving taxi cabs and cutting hair." George Burns

<br />"I believe there's something out there watching over us. Unfortunately, it's the government.â  Woody Allen
<br />
<br />"As Clerk of the Privy Council, a particular concern of mine revolves around the governance challenge embodied in the dichotomy between fast and slow. Our era of accelerated change has been compared to a 100-meter dash that is run over and over and over again. There are times when the speed of the public interest must be more deliberative â slower in real time â than private sector deliberations. There are usually more interests at stake in public sector issues, more people to be brought along and a more subtle, or at least different, calculation than the private sectorâs bottom line. Decisions are typically hard to reverse and there is intense pressure to get it right the first time. Governance in a democracy takes time â even if you donât stop to recount the chads. But there are instances when it cannot be otherwise and still remain a democracy." Mel Cappe, Clerk of the Privy Council
<br />
<br />
<br />"If there is anything that puzzles me in this game, it is that the longer that you are in the job of prime minister, the harder you have to work to do your job. With anything else ....you get to know the ropes pretty well and it becomes easy.  I feel the more you know, the more you have to know and  the more problems come at you.  It is certainly not because I do not delegate." Pierre Trudeau
<br />
<br />"I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past." Thomas Jefferson
<br />
<br />"Government is merely an attempt to express the conscience of everybody, the average conscience of the nation, in the rules that everybody is commanded to obey. That is all it is." Woodrow Wilson
<br />
<br />"All societies of men must be governed is some way or other. Men, in a word, must necessarily be controlled either by a power within them, or by a power without them; either by the word of God, or by the strong arm of man; either by the Bible or by the bayonet." Robert Winthrop
<br />
<br />"Arms discourage and keep the invader and plunderer in awe, and preserve order in the world as well as property. Horrid mischief would ensue were the law-abiding deprived of the use of them." Thomas Paine 
<br />

<br />
<br />"Nearly all men can withstand adversity; If you want to test a man's character, give him power. " Abraham Lincoln 
<br />
<br />"Of all tyrannies a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It may be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies. The robber baron's cruelty may sometimes sleep, his cupidity may at some point be satiated; but those who torment us for own good will torment us without end, for they do so with the approval of their own conscience." C. S. Lewis 
<br />
<br />"Everyone wants to live at the expense of the State. They forget that the State lives at the expense of everyone." Frederic Bastiat 
<br />
<br />"A government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away.â   Barry Goldwater 
<br />
<br />"All censorships exist to prevent any one from challenging current conceptions and existing institutions. All progress is initiated by challenging current conceptions, and executed by supplanting existing institutions. Consequently the first condition of progress is the removal of censorships." George Bernard Shaw 
<br />
<br />"Government is like an onion. To understand it, you have to peel through many different layers. Most outsiders never get beyond the first or second layer." Warren Bennis 
<br />
<br />"Nothing appears more surprising to those who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few." David Hume
<br />
<br />"In public affairs, stupidity is more dangerous than knavery, because it is harder to fight." Woodrow Wilson
<br />
<br />"Which government is the best? That which teaches us to govern ourselves." Goethe
<br />
<br />"Business has three main constituencies; government has dozens.   What constitutes a signal achievement in one constituencyâs eyesâ¦ may be a disaster to others."   Timothy Plumtre
<br />
<br />"The more corrupt the state, the more numerous the laws."  Tacitus
<br />
<br />"A good government implies two things; first fidelity to the object of government, which is the happiness of the people; secondly, a knowledge of the means by which that object can be best attained."  James Madison
<br />
<br />"What makes equality such a difficult business is that we only want it with our superiors." Henry Becque
<br />
<br />"In government, all of the incentive is in the direction of not making mistakes.  You can have 99 successes and nobody notices, and one mistake and youâre dead."  Lou Winnick
<br />
<br />"One law for lion and ox is oppression."  William Blake
<br />
<br />"Itâs a billion here and a billion there; the first thing you know it adds up to real money."  Senator Everett Dirksen
<br />
<br />"Much has been said about the analogy between running a business and running a government.  This is a sloppy analogy from a start.  If one simply substitutes  ârunning a businessâ on the one hand and âgoverning a parliamentary democracyâ on the other hand the falsity of the conceit is obvious."  Lord Bancroft
<br />
<br />"A government that robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend upon the support of Paul." George Bernard Shaw
<br />
<br />"A society of sheep must in time beget a government of wolves."  Unknown
<br />
<br />"Giving money and power to Government is like giving whiskey and car keys to teenage boys."  P. J. OâRourke
<br />
<br />"Every central government worships uniformity: uniformity relieves it from inquiry into an infinity of details, which must be attended to if rules have to be adapted to different men, instead of indiscriminately subjecting all men to the same rule." De Tocqueville
<br />
<br />"A little government and a little luck are necessary in life, but only a fool trusts either of them." P. J. OâRourke
<br />
<br />"Governing a large state is like boiling a small fish." Lao-Tzu
<br />
<br />"Business and government administration are alike in all unimportant respects." Wallace Sayre
<br />
<br />"The word government is from the Greek word, which means âto steerâ.  The job of government is to steer,  not to row the boat.  Delivering services is rowing and government is not very good at rowing."  E. S. Savas
<br />
<br />"An atomic energy plant can slip through parliament easily.  A rug in a mayorâs office â an issue everyone can understand â can tie up a municipal council for ages.  The risk is asymmetric.  In government, what gets you in a hassle is seldom the huge decisions that were clearly wrong, itâs the little things that that were clearly trivial by comparison." Anonymous official
<br />
<br />"Power worship blurs political judgment because it leads, almost unavoidably, to the belief that present trends will continue.  Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem invincible."  George Orwell
<br />
<br />"There is not enough jails, not enough policemen, not enough courts to enforce a law not supported by the people." Hubert Humphrey
<br />
<br />"Much of the language of business is competitive, even military, in nature: strategy, tactics, aggressive stances, exploitation of advantage, overcoming the competition, positioning, consolidation of position.  In government, the motivation is not financial advantage and  the context is not the competitive world of the marketplace.   Cabinetâs mandate is the attainment of that elusive goal  good government.   The ends of good government have to do with such abstract matters as social and economic well-being, personal freedom, equality under the law or cultural enhancement.  The possibility of so  many different interpretations of these objectives makes the task of government a good deal more contentious than that of business." Timothy Plumtre
<br />
<br />"The art of government is the organization of idolatry."  George Bernard Shaw
<br />
<br />"The budget should be balanced; the treasury refilled; public debt should be reduced; the arrogance of officialdom should be tempered and controlled; and assistance to foreign lands should be limited, lest the State become bankrupt.   The people should be forced to work and not depend on Government for assistance." Marcus Tullius Cicero
<br />
<br />"We have conferred a mystic popularity upon officials whose only virtue is their timidity; while our scorn of rebels and reformers is so great that we have ceased to persecute them.  The capitals and governments of the world are in the hands of caution; and change comes over them only in the night, unseen." Will Durant
<br />
<br />"It would be desirable if every Government, when it comes to power, should have its old speeches burnt." Viscount Snowden
<br />
<br />"Here is the values we shall find recurring wherever government is opposed: a belief that government, as a necessary evil, should be kept at a minimum; and that legitimate social activity should be provincial, amateur, authentic, spontaneous, candid, homogenous, traditional, popular, organic, right-oriented, religious, voluntary, participatory, and rotational.  Values contrasting with those are not polar opposites, but distant points on the continuum of approaches to government â namely, a belief that government is sometimes a positive good, and that it should be cosmopolitan, expert, authoritative, efficient, confidential, articulated in its parts, progressive, elite, mechanical, duties-oriented, secular, regulatory, and delegative, with a division of labor.  Ideally, government should combine all these values in a tempered way, since one set does not necessarily preclude the other. Butâ¦group after group in our history does treat the first cluster of values as endangered by the second, under siege from them." Gary Wills
<br />
<br />"The science of constructing a commonwealth or renovating it, or reforming it, isâ¦not to be taught a prioriâ¦That which in the first instance is prejudicial may be excellent in its remoter operation, and its excellence may rise even from the ill effects it produces in the beginning.  The reverse also happens; and very plausible schemes, with very pleasing commencements, have often shameful and lamentable conclusions."  Edmund Burke
