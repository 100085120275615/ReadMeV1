<span><strong>Will the Center Hold?</strong><br />Over the years I have been asked many times by my students about the Bergs and the Kabbala Center. My response is usually: Real kabbalists don't advertise. Almost anyone who calls themself a kabbalist isn't. Most importantly: do they walk the walk or just talk the talk? Every great kabbalist you have ever heard of from Rabi Shimon bar Yochai to the Arizal to the Great Chassidic masters, <strong>all of them without exception</strong> kept halacha (Jewish Law) very strictly and knew all of the revealed Torah. Without that, you can't get there from here! Look at the teachers of the Center and see: are they 100% committed to halacha? If so, great! If not, stay away. Are they in it for financial gain? If so, stay away.<br /><br /></span><span>Whatever you may hear from others is probably Lashon Hara (the Speech of Evil). So test it for yourself. As in (nearly) everything in This World there is certainly a mixture of Good and Ill..<br /><br /><br /><strong>Iraq, how will it end?</strong><br />It's clear that we can't win there using our regular style of warfighting and semi-relying on the newbie Iraqi government. However, just as clearly, President Bush can't ever back down. I agree that it would be great to achieve our goal of a democratic Iraq. If there was some way to truly and effectively clean out that sh*t-hole. However, we can't. There is no way to effectively control suicide bombers, not without a sealed border and serious checkpoints. That doesn't exist in Iraq. Looks like the only way out will be for the Dems to get back in power. They will of course immediately bring our boys home etc. That would be 2009 at the earliest. I do not at all relish the thought of the libs back in power. However when they do regain control, President Hillary will certainly abandon the oppressed peoples of the world once again to their dictators' devices...<br /><br /><strong></strong></span><br /><span><strong>Agony</strong><br />The three missing boys in Camden were found in the trunk of an abandoned Toyota Camry in the empty lot where they were last seen.

Her response: "I definitely think it's important for me to practice harder than what I have been," Williams said Saturday night, a pink visor pulled low above her reddened eyes. "I've never been big on practicing. I've kind of just been all about playing." <a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/06/26/sports/s082954D41.DTL"><span>http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/06/26/sports/s082954D41.DTL</span></a><span> </span><br /><br /></span></span>
