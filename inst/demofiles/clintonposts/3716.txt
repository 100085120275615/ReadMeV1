<div>We know that Pirro is going up against Hillary in '06 for the New York Senate seat.  I'm rooting for Pirro, but that probably goes without saying.  The AP just reported that Hillary got a fund raising letter at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. from Jeannine Pirro.  The AP goes on to report the contents of the letter and makes it appear that it was either done purposely or out of stupidity and doesn't, until the end of the article, say that Pirro's campaign manager said the fundraising appeal was sent because someone registered the information on Pirro's campaign Web site.  Not that it was definately because someone registered Hillary to get the letter, but her campaign manager "said" it was.<br />
<br />C'mon.  We all know someone played a joke and it was funny, I'll admit, but definately not such a newsworthy item that AP should be reporting on it.  This is anything BUT newsworthy.  How trifling can a major news source get?  Well, it WAS the AP after all.<br />
<br />Clinton's spokesman Howard Wilson said, "No wonder Ms. Pirro raised so little money,"  and said the letter was forwarded to Clinton's Senate office.  Can you say "Petty Asshole"?<br />
<br />While Jeannine Pirro goes to the heart of the people asking for donations, Clinton can keep doing her special Hollywood Galas for the big bucks.  In the end most of Hollywood can't vote for her in the Senate race and who will determine whether or not she keeps her seat? - New Yorkers.  Not the fancy pants, liberal, self-aggrandizing big mouths in Hollywood.</div>
