It has now escalated into a conservative campaign to swiftboat a decorated Marine veteran. </p>
<p>Once called one of the most hawkish members of Congress, Rep. John Murtha is now being presented as some anti war coward. His <a target="_blank" href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/06/the_haditha_story.html">remarks</a> about Haditha have unleashed just the latest salvo in the swiftboating strategy invented by conservatives, which they are now being forced to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/20060601-085033-5634r.htm">defend and explain</a>. </p><p>Prior to 2005, The Cybercast News Service (CNS), purveyor of all things conservative and run by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mediatransparency.org/personprofile.php?personID=21">L. Brent Bozell III</a>, had only one article about Rep. John Murtha.

''But somebody recommended this policy to him, and he took the recommendation. Somebody has to be held responsible, and he's got to make the decision who it was.'' ... Mr. Murtha is regarded by both parties as a respected voice on military matters. Citing poor supplies and support for the troops, he said he favored quick approval of the $87 billion Mr. Bush requested for Iraq but said the leaders needed to be replaced. He did not specify which. ... </p><p>THE STRUGGLE FOR IRAQ: CONGRESS; Democratic Hawk Urges Firing of Bush Aides (<a target="_blank" href="http://select.nytimes.com/search/restricted/article?res=F00F13FB3F5E0C748DDDA00894DB404482">Times Select</a>, September 17, 2003)</p></blockquote><p>In September 2003, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A7368-2003Sep26?language=printer">Iraq Toll Hits a Nerve With Murtha</a> obviously resounded across red and blue states, as well as north and south boundaries. However, with John Murtha considered a hawk by anyone's standards, the conservatives had to change his legendary biography, but how?</p><p>Even before the president's press secretary, Republican majority leader of the House, Rep. Tom Delay, aka the Hammer, took a preemptive shot. The Hammer tried to assail Murtha's hawk status through the Democratic Party. Delay made <a target="_blank" href="http://washingtontimes.com/national/20040506-115327-4519r.htm">Democrats the target</a>, by accusing Murtha and others of saying &quot;that American troops aren't up to the job.&quot; That was back in May, 2004. A few months later it simply wouldn't be enough. With Iraq unraveling and no way out, Murtha had begun to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/04228/361965.stm">dismantle the conservative playbook</a> on national security. This was serious.</p><p>Two years later, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/the-murtha-effect-why-re_b_15262.html">Arianna Huffington</a> would call it the &quot;Murtha Effect,&quot; which showed the conservative newspaper chain backed by Clinton hater Richard Melon Scaiffe, who is known as the &quot;Funding Father of the Right,&quot; endorsing Murtha's Iraq withdrawal plan in January 2006. </p><p>As the old Missouri saying goes, them's fightin' words.</p><p>That fight began on November 17, 2005, the day Murtha presented his plan for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/17/politics/17text-murtha.html?ex=1152331200&en=8853f82feb16f29d&ei=5070">redeployment from Iraq</a>, which called for a &quot;change in direction.&quot; After trying for years to get President Bush, Secretary Rumsfeld and the administration to change course, through letters and public pleas, the 37-year Marine veteran realized it wasn't going to happen. To say Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, didn't take Murtha's challenge lightly is an understatement.</p><blockquote><p>Murtha's resolution included language the Republicans wanted to avoid, such as &quot;the American people have not been shown clear, measurable progress&quot; toward stability in Iraq. It also said troops should be withdrawn &quot;at the earliest practicable date,&quot; although Murtha said in statements and interviews Thursday that the drawdown should begin now.</p><p>Armed Services Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) drafted a simpler resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of troops, saying it was a fair interpretation of Murtha's intent. Members were heatedly debating a procedural rule concerning the Hunter resolution when Rep. Jean Schmidt (R-Ohio) was recognized at 5:20 p.m. Schmidt won a special election in August, defeating Iraq war veteran Paul Hackett, and is so new to Congress that some colleagues do not know her name.</p><p>(snip)</p><p>It was past 10 p.m. when Murtha addressed a relatively subdued House. Hunter's resolution &quot;is not what I envisioned&quot; because it avoids a broader debate of the war, which &quot;is not going as advertised,&quot; Murtha said. &quot;The American people are way ahead of us&quot; in wanting a strategy to bring the troops home, he added. &quot;It's easy to sit in your air-conditioned offices and send them into battle.&quot;</p><p>(snip)</p><p>Top Democrats attacked the GOP tactic. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the Republicans &quot;engaged in an act of deception that undermines any shred of dignity that might be left in this Republican Congress.&quot; She called Hunter's resolution &quot;a political stunt&quot; and &quot;a disservice to our country and to our men and women in uniform.&quot;</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/18/AR2005111802896.html">House Rejects Iraq Pullout After GOP Forces a Vote</a><br />Democrats Enraged By Personal Attack</p></blockquote><p>This was the day Rep. Jean Schmidt basically <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thinkprogress.org/2005/11/18/schmidt-shame/">called Murtha a coward</a>, and then was made to apologize for her remarks because <a target="_blank" href="http://thinkprogress.org/2005/11/22/schmidt-marine/">she didn't have the evidence</a> to back it up. </p><p>One of the oddest headlines of November 18th, however, was when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5018733">NPR</a> ran <em>Long-time War Hawk, Murtha Is An Angry Dove</em>. After decades of being a military hawk, because Murtha couldn't get a response from President Bush and Donald Rumsfeld, after years of trying, Rep. John Murtha was now not just angry, but an &quot;Angry <em>Dove</em>.&quot;</p><p>Murtha's <a target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10118733/site/newsweek/">&quot;dark night of the soul&quot;</a> had reached a moment where he had to speak out. George W. Bush pitted against the 37-year Marine veteran was no contest and the Republicans knew it. Murtha had become a &quot;one man tipping point&quot; for President Bush. The &quot;war room&quot; was back.</p><blockquote><p>But White House aides concede that they, too, were at fault for having assumed that Bush was personally unassailable and that events&mdash;and explanations of them&mdash;would take care of themselves. A war-room defense was &quot;something we did well during the campaign,&quot; said Nicolle Wallace, Bush's communications director. &quot;Maybe incorrectly, we had hoped or presumed that wouldn't be necessary after the election.&quot;</p><p>It is. The war room now is back, staffed with many of the same people who ran it in 2004, led by the Boy Genius himself, Karl Rove. </p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10118733/site/newsweek/">Bush at the Tipping Point</a>, by Howard Fineman (Nov. 28, 2005 issue)</p></blockquote><p>Murtha's call for redeployment on Iraq was called a &quot;Cronkite moment,&quot; harkening back to when <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/28/shields.murtha/index.html">Walter Cronkite inspired LBJ</a> to say, <em>&quot;That's it. If I've lost Cronkite, I've lost middle America.&quot;</em> With Murtha asserting the Iraq policies of Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld had &quot;failed,&quot; the entire conservative foreign policy platform was in the kill zone.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Brent_Bozell">L. Brent Bozell III</a>'s first serious attack on Murtha since CNS praised Murtha for the 9/11 memorial legislation back in 2002, was coverage of Ken Mehlman claiming the Democrats were calling for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/Archive/200511/POL20051118a.html">&quot;surrender.&quot;</a> The next big story came on January 13, 2006, when Murtha's war hero status was called into question. </p><blockquote><p>&quot;[Murtha] is putting himself forward as some combat veteran with serious wounds and he's using that and it's dishonest and it's wrong,&quot; Bailey told Cybercast News Service on Jan. 9. Murtha served in the Marines on active duty and in the reserves from 1952 until his retirement as a colonel in 1990. He volunteered for service in Vietnam and was a First Marine Regiment intelligence officer in 1966 and 1967. </p><p>Murtha and Bailey, once allies, were forced to run against each other in a Democratic congressional primary in 1982 following redistricting. Murtha won the election. </p><p>Murtha has, in the past, publicly dismissed any questions about whether he deserved his two Purple Hearts, noting during his 1994 congressional campaign that &quot;I am proud of my service in Vietnam.&quot; </p><p>In his Friday, Jan. 13, response to the Cybercast News Service investigation, Murtha again defended his military record. </p><p>&quot;Questions about my record are clearly an attempt to distract attention from the real issue, which is that our brave men and women in uniform are dying and being injured every day in the middle of a civil war that can be resolved only by the Iraqis themselves,&quot; Murtha wrote in an email response. </p><p>&quot;I volunteered for a year's duty in Vietnam. I was out in the field almost every single day. We took heavy casualties in my regiment the year that I was there. In my fitness reports, I was rated No. 1.

Murtha's brother a defense department lobbyist? Did Murtha influence contracts his way? Seems fair game, but they deny it. But if that's fair, then what about <a target="_blank" href="http://downwithtyranny.blogspot.com/2005/12/duncan-hunter-even-worse-than-randy.html">Rep. Duncan Hunter's money shenanigans</a> as Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which are more varied and a lot deeper?</p><p>One of the big unknowns in the campaign against Rep. John Murtha remains Rep. Duncan Hunter. Newsweek reported that the FBI is investigating Brent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/000651.php">&quot;boom shaka laka&quot;</a> Wilkes&rsquo;s ties to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/000771.php">Duncan Hunter</a>. It was Duncan Hunter's association that got me <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=24189">interested</a> a couple of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=24202">weeks</a> ago, because where there are conservatives, money and defense contracts, corruption has been proven to follow. Just ask <a target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2005-11-29-cunningham-case_x.htm">conservative Republican Duke Cunningham</a> and the cast of characters around him that includes Duncan Hunter. The list is long, which a search on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/">TPM Muckraker</a> will reveal.</p><p>However, one member, Amanda Doss, who started <a target="_blank" href="http://murthalied.com/">Murthalied.com</a>, has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.murthalied.com/">folded one tent</a> and joined forces with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bootmurtha.com/">BootMurtha</a>. Evidently, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/New_Murtha_Lied_Website_posts_hateful_0625.html">she couldn't stand the heat</a>. BootMurtha is run by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bootmurtha.com/Pages/BaileyBrief.htm">Larry &quot;proud to be swiftboating&quot; Bailey</a>. Doss's original site came out of <a target="_blank" href="http://kerrylied.com/">KerryLied.com</a>, which was helped along by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38535">WorldNetDaily</a>. (Oh, there's also <a target="_blank" href="http://murthamustgo.blogspot.com/">MurthaMustGo</a>.) </p><p>That brings us to Tony Snesko, a prominent <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nationalreview.com/babbin/babbin200409080845.asp">Swiftboat Veterans for Truth</a> guy who <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2005/1/21/03848.shtml">&quot;inspired Operation Street Corner,&quot;</a> which is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.operationstreetcorner.com/osc/oscabout.htm">Doss's baby</a>. A fitting name, if you ask me. But that's not the only thing interesting about Mr. Snesko. His wife, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.leadershipprofiles.com/preview.asp?docid=370917&t=0">Valerie Snesko</a>, works as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/bio/staff/?id=677">personal appointment secretary</a> for Rep. Duncan Hunter. So it looks like we've come full circle. When I broke out with the Hunter - Murtha angle recently, I got a hold of an email that was reminiscent of the bad old days of the non denial denial. </p><blockquote><p>In light of other E-mails I have received today, I am assuming that you are connecting me with Murtha, who I have said nothing against and I am not associated with the Murthalied. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=24194">Tony</a></p></blockquote><p>If Tony is getting emails he has only himself to blame, because he's listed as the contact number for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nrcc.org/contents/events/">an engagement featuring Rep. Duncan Hunter</a> that appears on the National Republican Congressional Committee website.</p><p>It doesn't explain why conservative Rep. Duncan Hunter is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=24193">selling out</a> a fellow brother in arms.</p><p>Is Hunter's personal secretary being married to a former Swiftboat Veteran for Truth just a coincidence? Is it just a coincidence that the attacks on Murtha started immediately after Rep. Murtha dared to suggest redeployment of American troops from Iraq? Are all these people connected to each other and conservative causes, organizations, the Republican Party and their bloggers and writers, and the swiftboating acts against John Murtha all just one big coincidence? </p><p>It can't be to get Ms. Diane Irey elected instead of Murtha, because if you investigate her it turns out her husband went to Iraq to make money, only to have his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=13185">partner end up murdered</a>. You then find out the only claim to fame of Ms. Irey is the swiftboating of Rep. John Murtha. Irey has <a target="_blank" href="http://vets4irey.com/">Vets4Irey</a>, which is connected to <a target="_blank" href="http://vets4bush.com/">Vets4Bush</a> and was created by the same guy who allowed Senator John Kerry to be called a <a target="_blank" href="http://vets4bush.com/editorials.shtml">&quot;traitor&quot;</a> on the site as part of the swiftboating of the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004. Maybe we should just call what's happening to Murtha a congressional <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=24156">fragging</a>.</p><p>Oh, and speaking of fragging, what would the swiftboating of a Democratic veteran be without conservative Ann Coulter's latest comment about <a target="_blank" href="http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002689569">Rep. John Murtha</a>: <em>&quot;The reason soldiers invented 'fragging.'&quot; </em>Hey, but not to worry, Ann, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2006/6/17/152828.shtml">NewsMax</a> has your back.</p><p>Now called &quot;swiftboating,&quot; going after fellow combat veterans is a new phenomenon, invented by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=24093">conservatives</a> to go after veterans who buck the powers that be. It started with the swiftboating of Senator John McCain during the 2000 primaries and originated with George W. Bush's first presidential campaign. It has spread out to include former <a target="_blank" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/max-cleland">decorated veteran</a>, former Senator Max Cleland, as well as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.taylormarsh.com/archives_view.php?id=2263">retired generals</a> who have criticized the Iraq war policies of President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld.</p><p>Hang on, because it's not over yet. After all, November elections are coming up and as Iraq goes, so goes the conservatives, the Republican Party and the national security image they are trying so desperately to salvage.</p><p><em>Taylor Marsh</em></p>
