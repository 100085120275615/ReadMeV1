<p><font>As you all know, Iâm the lucky father of four beautiful children, and I feel no greater joy on this earth than watching them grow. My oldest daughter Mary has been a special inspiration, as she has met and overcome a number of personal challenges in her life. Sheâs always made me proud, showing courage, strength of character and more drive than anyone I know. Not only do I love her with all of my heart, but I genuinely like and respect her as a person. Itâs for all these reasons and more that, Iâm locking her in our basement. I guess I should explain. First off, I have a really nice basement. Thereâs cable down there, a really comfortable couch where I like to take naps when my wife thinks Iâm working on a âprojectâ, and thereâs even an old fridge filled with Yoo-hoo and an array of Little Debbie snacks. As you can plainly see, it ainât exactly a root cellar so cut me a little slack. </font></p>
<p><font>Second of all, Mary is about to start college. Away from home. Not near me. At a place where there are boys and, well, umâ¦boys! Why, I myself was a boy in college once and while my stay in the hallowed halls of higher education may have been brief, there is one thing that I do remember: Girls. There isnât a father of a daughter reading this that doesnât know exactly what Iâm talking about. We know what we were and weâre terrified. Even if you take boys out of the equation, thereâs the pervasive liberal agenda on college campuses, the possible ideological tyranny of tenured professors, and the exposure to unchecked peer pressure. What if Mary is at a party and someone offers her, sayâ¦a âHillary in 2008â button? Sure everyone experiments and does some crazy things when theyâre young, but the thought of my daughter advocating for another Clinton in the White House worries me so much Iâm pulling out the few remaining hairs that arenât leaving on their own. Baby, this is daddy sending you all his willpower to âjust say no!â </font></p>
<p><font>Drugs and alcohol are one thing, but the long-term side effects of Hillary as president are just too chilling to consider. Iâm still having flashbacks from her healthcare proposal of 1993. That was one scary tripâ¦</font></p>
<p><font>Now that Iâm really thinking about it, I know that my daughter is smartâ¦way smarter than her dad. I learn more from all my kids than Iâve ever taught them. In the end, sheâs going to be just fineâ¦even though Iâm sure something will happen that will make me nostalgic for one of my blackouts from the old days. Why did I waste them all on drinking? If only I could have put one in the âbankâ to withdraw now that Iâm a parentâafter all, what daddy canât remember canât make daddy crazy. Aw heck, Maryâs shown good judgment her whole life. I know sheâll make good decisions and continue down her own unique path. I trust herâ¦ but Iâm still locking her in the basement. With all the channels on cable these days, thatâs just as good as a college education, right? Plus, thereâs all that Yoo-hoo.</p>
