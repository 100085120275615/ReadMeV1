<div>You know what I really hate hearing from Democrats? You've probably heard it:<br />
<br />"I like Hillary--- I think she'd be a great president... but I just don't think she could get elected."<br />
<br />Oh? Why's that?<br />
<br />"So many people hate her."<br />
<br />Oh? Who says?<br />
<br />"Well, there's just so much Clinton-hatred out there."<br />
<br />Let's look at the electoral map, then, shall we?<br />
<br />In 1992, Bill Clinton won Colorado, West Virginia, New Mexico, Louisiana, Kentucky, and Arkansas--- all states lost by Kerry in 2004.<br />
<br />Sound like the country hates him yet?<br />
<br />In 1996, he picked up Florida, Missouri, Nevada, Ohio, Tennessee--- other states that Kerry lost in 2004.<br />
<br />Sounds like a real hated guy nationally, right?<br />
<br />People talk about "Clinton-hatred" like it's something believed by some large block of Americans. It's not; it's the word used to describe a radical and tyrannical minority that hated everything he stood for and, to stop him, stopped at nothing short of hauling the constitution out of its vault at the National Archives and ripping it to shreds.<br />
<br />No polling has EVER shown that Hillary is vehemently disliked on the national stage. To my Democratic friends: If you want a candidate who will represent you in the white house, VOTE FOR THE ONE YOU WANT IN THE PRIMARY.<br />
<br />If I hear the word "electable" once in the 2008 primary, I swear to God--- and you can hold me to this--- I will move to England.</div>
