	<blockquote><p>Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, sold his memoirs to Pearson PLC&#8217;s Penguin Press imprint for more than $8 million, according to those familiar with the situation. The book is expected to be published in fall 2007. </p>
	<p>&#8220;We think he is going to write a book that will live for a long time,&#8221; said Susan Petersen Kennedy, president of Penguin Group (USA). &#8220;He lived through an amazing part of history, and he was never able to speak out. He had to be very careful because of his position.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Mr. Greenspan also will look to the future. &#8220;He&#8217;s going to offer American readers a look at the economic situation, the political situation and the global economy,&#8221; Ms. Kennedy said. &#8220;He has a complete world view.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s pronouncements before Congress were closely watched and often eloquent, but they were also deliberately abstract, even opaque. Even so, Ann Godoff, publisher of Penguin Press, thinks the broad public will want to read the book. </p>
	<p>&#8220;He wants to write a general-interest book that will last for many generations,&#8221; said Ms. Godoff. &#8220;He is loaded with anecdotes and goes from one to the next.&#8221; </p>
	<p>The advance is one of the biggest in the history of U.S. publishing, but because it includes world-wide rights, it will be partly offset by sales to foreign publishers. </p>
	<p>Mr. Greenspan&#8217;s memoir will be edited by Scott Moyers, the editor in chief of Penguin Press. It isn&#8217;t clear if Mr. Greenspan will work with an outside writer, though Ms. Godoff said Mr. Greenspan told her he intends to write the first and final drafts. </p>
	<p>Robert Barnett, the Washington-based attorney who represented Mr. Greenspan, said more than a dozen publishers participated in the four-day auction. </p>
	<p>Mr. Barnett also represented the Clintons in their recent book projects. </p>
	<p>Former President Clinton&#8217;s memoir, &#8220;My Life,&#8221; received an advance estimated at $10 million or more from Bertelsmann AG&#8217;s Alfred A. Knopf imprint, while CBS Corp.&#8217;s Simon &#038; Schuster paid an $8 million advance for Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton&#8217;s memoir &#8220;Living History.&#8221; </p>
	<p>Press reports in 1994 stated that Pope John Paul II received an advance of $6 million to $7 million for &#8220;Crossing the Threshold of Hope,&#8221; published that year by Knopf. </p></blockquote>
