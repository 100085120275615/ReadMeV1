<div>Iâm seeing more and more articles like<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1425817,00.html"> this</a> one in the Guardian, a British left wing rag, calling on the left to get in on Iraq so as not to let American cowboy âconservativesâ define the new democracies that may emerge in the Middle East. I canât help being optimistic about Iraq when politicians as opportunistic as Hillary Clinton start flocking to Iraq to declare success.<br />
<br /> At some campaign stop somewhere last year I remember John Kerry saying something about how âweâ won the cold war, I remember thinking no thanks to you, whatâs this we shit John?  Could it be the left does not want to be wrong twice in 20 years?</div>
