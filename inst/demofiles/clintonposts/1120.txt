The Constitution is clear in assigning to Congress the power to write the laws and to the president a duty ''to take care that the laws be faithfully executed." Bush, however, has repeatedly declared that he does not need to ''execute" a law he believes is unconstitutional.<br /><br />Former administration officials contend that just because Bush reserves the right to disobey a law does not mean he is not enforcing it: In many cases, he is simply asserting his belief that a certain requirement encroaches on presidential power.<br /><br />But with the disclosure of Bush's domestic spying program, in which he ignored a law requiring warrants to tap the phones of Americans, many legal specialists say Bush is hardly reluctant to bypass laws he believes he has the constitutional authority to override.<br /><br />Far more than any predecessor, Bush has been aggressive about declaring his right to ignore vast swaths of laws -- many of which he says infringe on power he believes the Constitution assigns to him alone as the head of the executive branch or the commander in chief of the military.<br /><br />Many legal scholars say they believe that Bush's theory about his own powers goes too far and that he is seizing for himself some of the law-making role of Congress and the Constitution-interpreting role of the courts.<br /><br />Phillip Cooper, a Portland State University law professor who has studied the executive power claims Bush made during his first term, said Bush and his legal team have spent the past five years quietly working to concentrate ever more governmental power into the White House.<br /><br />''There is no question that this administration has been involved in a very carefully thought-out, systematic process of expanding presidential power at the expense of the other branches of government," Cooper said. ''This is really big, very expansive, and very significant."<br /><br />For the first five years of Bush's presidency, his legal claims attracted little attention in Congress or the media. Then, twice in recent months, Bush drew scrutiny after challenging new laws: a torture ban and a requirement that he give detailed reports to Congress about how he is using the Patriot Act.<br /><br />Bush administration spokesmen declined to make White House or Justice Department attorneys available to discuss any of Bush's challenges to the laws he has signed.<br /><br />Instead, they referred a Globe reporter to their response to questions about Bush's position that he could ignore provisions of the Patriot Act. They said at the time that Bush was following a practice that has ''been used for several administrations" and that ''the president will faithfully execute the law in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution."<br /><br />But the words ''in a manner that is consistent with the Constitution" are the catch, legal scholars say, because Bush is according himself the ultimate interpretation of the Constitution. And he is quietly exercising that authority to a degree that is unprecedented in US history.<br /><br />Bush is the first president in modern history who has never vetoed a bill, giving Congress no chance to override his judgments. Instead, he has signed every bill that reached his desk, often inviting the legislation's sponsors to signing ceremonies at which he lavishes praise upon their work.<br /><br />Then, after the media and the lawmakers have left the White House, Bush quietly files ''signing statements" -- official documents in which a president lays out his legal interpretation of a bill for the federal bureaucracy to follow when implementing the new law. The statements are recorded in the federal register.<br /><br />In his signing statements, Bush has repeatedly asserted that the Constitution gives him the right to ignore numerous sections of the bills -- sometimes including provisions that were the subject of negotiations with Congress in order to get lawmakers to pass the bill. He has appended such statements to more than one of every 10 bills he has signed.<br /><br />''He agrees to a compromise with members of Congress, and all of them are there for a public bill-signing ceremony, but then he takes back those compromises -- and more often than not, without the Congress or the press or the public knowing what has happened," said Christopher Kelley, a Miami University of Ohio political science professor who studies executive power.<br /><br /><span>Military link </span></strong><span><br /></span><span><div align="left"><br /></span></div><strong>Many of the laws Bush said he can bypass -- including the torture ban -- involve the military.<br /><br />The Constitution grants Congress the power to create armies, to declare war, to make rules for captured enemies, and ''to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces." But, citing his role as commander in chief, Bush says he can ignore any act of Congress that seeks to regulate the military.<br /><br />On at least four occasions while Bush has been president, Congress has passed laws forbidding US troops from engaging in combat in Colombia, where the US military is advising the government in its struggle against narcotics-funded Marxist rebels.<br /><br />After signing each bill, Bush declared in his signing statement that he did not have to obey any of the Colombia restrictions because he is commander in chief.<br /><br />Bush has also said he can bypass laws requiring him to tell Congress before diverting money from an authorized program in order to start a secret operation, such as the ''black sites" where suspected terrorists are secretly imprisoned.<br /><br />Congress has also twice passed laws forbidding the military from using intelligence that was not ''lawfully collected," including any information on Americans that was gathered in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protections against unreasonable searches.<br /><br />Congress first passed this provision in August 2004, when Bush's warrantless domestic spying program was still a secret, and passed it again after the program's existence was disclosed in December 2005.<br /><br />On both occasions, Bush declared in signing statements that only he, as commander in chief, could decide whether such intelligence can be used by the military.<br /><br />In October 2004, five months after the Abu Ghraib torture scandal in Iraq came to light, Congress passed a series of new rules and regulations for military prisons. Bush signed the provisions into law, then said he could ignore them all. One provision made clear that military lawyers can give their commanders independent advice on such issues as what would constitute torture. But Bush declared that military lawyers could not contradict his administration's lawyers.<br /><br />Other provisions required the Pentagon to retrain military prison guards on the requirements for humane treatment of detainees under the Geneva Conventions, to perform background checks on civilian contractors in Iraq, and to ban such contractors from performing ''security, intelligence, law enforcement, and criminal justice functions." Bush reserved the right to ignore any of the requirements.<br /><br />The new law also created the position of inspector general for Iraq. But Bush wrote in his signing statement that the inspector ''shall refrain" from investigating any intelligence or national security matter, or any crime the Pentagon says it prefers to investigate for itself.<br /><br />Bush had placed similar limits on an inspector general position created by Congress in November 2003 for the initial stage of the US occupation of Iraq. The earlier law also empowered the inspector to notify Congress if a US official refused to cooperate. Bush said the inspector could not give any information to Congress without permission from the administration.<br /><br /><span>Oversight questioned</span> </strong><br /><div align="left"><br /><strong>Many laws Bush has asserted he can bypass involve requirements to give information about government activity to congressional oversight committees.<br /><br />In December 2004, Congress passed an intelligence bill requiring the Justice Department to tell them how often, and in what situations, the FBI was using special national security wiretaps on US soil. The law also required the Justice Department to give oversight committees copies of administration memos outlining any new interpretations of domestic-spying laws. And it contained 11 other requirements for reports about such issues as civil liberties, security clearances, border security, and counternarcotics efforts.<br /><br />After signing the bill, Bush issued a signing statement saying he could withhold all the information sought by Congress.<br /><br />Likewise, when Congress passed the law creating the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, it said oversight committees must be given information about vulnerabilities at chemical plants and the screening of checked bags at airports.<br /><br />It also said Congress must be shown unaltered reports about problems with visa services prepared by a new immigration ombudsman. Bush asserted the right to withhold the information and alter the reports.<br /><br />On several other occasions, Bush contended he could nullify laws creating ''whistle-blower" job protections for federal employees that would stop any attempt to fire them as punishment for telling a member of Congress about possible government wrongdoing.<br /><br />When Congress passed a massive energy package in August, for example, it strengthened whistle-blower protections for employees at the Department of Energy and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.<br /><br />The provision was included because lawmakers feared that Bush appointees were intimidating nuclear specialists so they would not testify about safety issues related to a planned nuclear-waste repository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada -- a facility the administration supported, but both Republicans and Democrats from Nevada opposed.<br /><br />When Bush signed the energy bill, he issued a signing statement declaring that the executive branch could ignore the whistle-blower protections.<br /><br />Bush's statement did more than send a threatening message to federal energy specialists inclined to raise concerns with Congress; it also raised the possibility that Bush would not feel bound to obey similar whistle-blower laws that were on the books before he became president. His domestic spying program, for example, violated a surveillance law enacted 23 years before he took office.<br /><br />David Golove, a New York University law professor who specializes in executive-power issues, said Bush has cast a cloud over ''the whole idea that there is a rule of law," because no one can be certain of which laws Bush thinks are valid and which he thinks he can ignore.<br /><br />''Where you have a president who is willing to declare vast quantities of the legislation that is passed during his term unconstitutional, it implies that he also thinks a very significant amount of the other laws that were already on the books before he became president are also unconstitutional," Golove said.<br /><br /></strong><strong><span>Defying Supreme Court </span></strong></div><span><div align="left"><br /></span></div><strong>Bush has also challenged statutes in which Congress gave certain executive branch officials the power to act independently of the president. The Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed the power of Congress to make such arrangements. For example, the court has upheld laws creating special prosecutors free of Justice Department oversight and insulating the board of the Federal Trade Commission from political interference.<br /><br />Nonetheless, Bush has said in his signing statements that the Constitution lets him control any executive official, no matter what a statute passed by Congress might say.<br /><br />In November 2002, for example, Congress, seeking to generate independent statistics about student performance, passed a law setting up an educational research institute to conduct studies and publish reports ''without the approval" of the Secretary of Education. Bush, however, decreed that the institute's director would be ''subject to the supervision and direction of the secretary of education."<br /><br />Similarly, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld affirmative-action programs, as long as they do not include quotas. Most recently, in 2003, the court upheld a race-conscious university admissions program over the strong objections of Bush, who argued that such programs should be struck down as unconstitutional.<br /><br />Yet despite the court's rulings, Bush has taken exception at least nine times to provisions that seek to ensure that minorities are represented among recipients of government jobs, contracts, and grants. Each time, he singled out the provisions, declaring that he would construe them ''in a manner consistent with" the Constitution's guarantee of ''equal protection" to all -- which some legal scholars say amounts to an argument that the affirmative-action provisions represent reverse discrimination against whites.<br /><br />Golove said that to the extent Bush is interpreting the Constitution in defiance of the Supreme Court's precedents, he threatens to ''overturn the existing structures of constitutional law."<br /><br />A president who ignores the court, backed by a Congress that is unwilling to challenge him, Golove said, can make the Constitution simply ''disappear."<br /><br /><span>Common practice in '80s</span></strong><br /><div align="left"><br /><strong>Though Bush has gone further than any previous president, his actions are not unprecedented.<br /><br />Since the early 19th century, American presidents have occasionally signed a large bill while declaring that they would not enforce a specific provision they believed was unconstitutional. On rare occasions, historians say, presidents also issued signing statements interpreting a law and explaining any concerns about it.<br /><br />But it was not until the mid-1980s, midway through the tenure of President Reagan, that it became common for the president to issue signing statements. The change came about after then-Attorney General Edwin Meese decided that signing statements could be used to increase the power of the president.<br /><br />When interpreting an ambiguous law, courts often look at the statute's legislative history, debate and testimony, to see what Congress intended it to mean. Meese realized that recording what the president thought the law meant in a signing statement might increase a president's influence over future court rulings.<br /><br />Under Meese's direction in 1986, a young Justice Department lawyer named Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote a strategy memo about signing statements. It came to light in late 2005, after Bush named Alito to the Supreme Court.<br /><br />In the memo, Alito predicted that Congress would resent the president's attempt to grab some of its power by seizing ''the last word on questions of interpretation." He suggested that Reagan's legal team should ''concentrate on points of true ambiguity, rather than issuing interpretations that may seem to conflict with those of Congress."<br /><br />Reagan's successors continued this practice. George H.W. Bush challenged 232 statutes over four years in office, and Bill Clinton objected to 140 laws over his eight years, according to Kelley, the Miami University of Ohio professor.<br /><br />Many of the challenges involved longstanding legal ambiguities and points of conflict between the president and Congress.<br /><br />Throughout the past two decades, for example, each president -- including the current one -- has objected to provisions requiring him to get permission from a congressional committee before taking action. The Supreme Court made clear in 1983 that only the full Congress can direct the executive branch to do things, but lawmakers have continued writing laws giving congressional committees such a role.<br /><br />Still, Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton used the presidential veto instead of the signing statement if they had a serious problem with a bill, giving Congress a chance to override their decisions.<br /><br />But the current President Bush has abandoned the veto entirely, as well as any semblance of the political caution that Alito counseled back in 1986. In just five years, Bush has challenged more than 750 new laws, by far a record for any president, while becoming the first president since Thomas Jefferson to stay so long in office without issuing a veto.<br /><br />''What we haven't seen until this administration is the sheer number of objections that are being raised on every bill passed through the White House," said Kelley, who has studied presidential signing statements through history. ''That is what is staggering. The numbers are well out of the norm from any previous administration."<br /><br />Exaggerated fears?<br />Some administration defenders say that concerns about Bush's signing statements are overblown. Bush's signing statements, they say, should be seen as little more than political chest-thumping by administration lawyers who are dedicated to protecting presidential prerogatives.<br /><br />Defenders say the fact that Bush is reserving the right to disobey the laws does not necessarily mean he has gone on to disobey them.<br /><br />Indeed, in some cases, the administration has ended up following laws that Bush said he could bypass. For example, citing his power to ''withhold information" in September 2002, Bush declared that he could ignore a law requiring the State Department to list the number of overseas deaths of US citizens in foreign countries. Nevertheless, the department has still put the list on its website.<br /><br />Jack Goldsmith, a Harvard Law School professor who until last year oversaw the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel for the administration, said the statements do not change the law; they just let people know how the president is interpreting it.<br /><br />''Nobody reads them," said Goldsmith. ''They have no significance. Nothing in the world changes by the publication of a signing statement. The statements merely serve as public notice about how the administration is interpreting the law. Criticism of this practice is surprising, since the usual complaint is that the administration is too secretive in its legal interpretations."<br /><br />But Cooper, the Portland State University professor who has studied Bush's first-term signing statements, said the documents are being read closely by one key group of people: the bureaucrats who are charged with implementing new laws.<br /><br />Lower-level officials will follow the president's instructions even when his understanding of a law conflicts with the clear intent of Congress, crafting policies that may endure long after Bush leaves office, Cooper said.<br /><br />''Years down the road, people will not understand why the policy doesn't look like the legislation," he said.<br /><br />And in many cases, critics contend, there is no way to know whether the administration is violating laws -- or merely preserving the right to do so.<br /><br />Many of the laws Bush has challenged involve national security, where it is almost impossible to verify what the government is doing. And since the disclosure of Bush's domestic spying program, many people have expressed alarm about his sweeping claims of the authority to violate laws.<br /><br />In January, after the Globe first wrote about Bush's contention that he could disobey the torture ban, three Republicans who were the bill's principal sponsors in the Senate -- John McCain of Arizona, John W. Warner of Virginia, and Lindsey O. Graham of South Carolina -- all publicly rebuked the president.<br /><br />''We believe the president understands Congress's intent in passing, by very large majorities, legislation governing the treatment of detainees," McCain and Warner said in a joint statement. ''The Congress declined when asked by administration officials to include a presidential waiver of the restrictions included in our legislation."<br /><br />Added Graham: ''I do not believe that any political figure in the country has the ability to set aside any . . . law of armed conflict that we have adopted or treaties that we have ratified."<br /><br />And in March, when the Globe first wrote about Bush's contention that he could ignore the oversight provisions of the Patriot Act, several Democrats lodged complaints.<br /><br />Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, accused Bush of trying to ''cherry-pick the laws he decides he wants to follow."<br /><br />And Representatives Jane Harman of California and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan -- the ranking Democrats on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees, respectively -- sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales demanding that Bush rescind his claim and abide by the law.<br /><br />''Many members who supported the final law did so based upon the guarantee of additional reporting and oversight," they wrote. ''The administration cannot, after the fact, unilaterally repeal provisions of the law implementing such oversight. . . . Once the president signs a bill, he and all of us are bound by it."<br /><br /><span>Lack of court review </span></strong></div><div align="left"><strong><span><br /></span>Such political fallout from Congress is likely to be the only check on Bush's claims, legal specialists said.<br /><br />The courts have little chance of reviewing Bush's assertions, especially in the secret realm of national security matters.<br /><br />''There can't be judicial review if nobody knows about it," said Neil Kinkopf, a Georgia State law professor who was a Justice Department official in the Clinton administration. ''And if they avoid judicial review, they avoid having their constitutional theories rebuked."<br /><br />Without court involvement, only Congress can check a president who goes too far. But Bush's fellow Republicans control both chambers, and they have shown limited interest in launching the kind of oversight that could damage their party.<br /><br />''The president is daring Congress to act against his positions, and they're not taking action because they don't want to appear to be too critical of the president, given that their own fortunes are tied to his because they are all Republicans," said Jack Beermann, a Boston University law professor. ''Oversight gets much reduced in a situation where the president and Congress are controlled by the same party."<br /><br />Said Golove, the New York University law professor: ''Bush has essentially said that 'We're the executive branch and we're going to carry this law out as we please, and if Congress wants to impeach us, go ahead and try it.' "<br /><br />Bruce Fein, a deputy attorney general in the Reagan administration, said the American system of government relies upon the leaders of each branch ''to exercise some self-restraint." But Bush has declared himself the sole judge of his own powers, he said, and then ruled for himself every time.<br /><br />''This is an attempt by the president to have the final word on his own constitutional powers, which eliminates the checks and balances that keep the country a democracy," Fein said. ''There is no way for an independent judiciary to check his assertions of power, and Congress isn't doing it, either. So this is moving us toward an unlimited executive power." </strong><br /><br /></div><a href="http://bombshelter.org" target="_blank"><div align="left"><img alt="Impeach the Bush Regime!" src="http://cache.boston.com/bonzai-fba/Reuters_Photo/2006/05/01/1146456546_0953.jpg" border="0" /></a></div><strong><span><span>Cheney To Head Mafia</span><br /></span><br />Spoof.com / K.C. Bell<br /><br />"Say cheese?"<br /><br />Following the recent arrest of Bernardo Provenzano, former head of the Mafia, a vacuum was created soon to be filled by retiring Vice President Dick Cheney. Mr. Provenzano eluded the police (real thing, not old singing group) for the last 43 years, while successfully running the organization from a secret location. Following the arrest, a worldwide search was initiated by several headhunter agencies endeavoring to locate a replacement.<br /><br />Though the position was initially offered to Osama Ben Laden, who refused, being too busy with a killing agenda promoting love of god, the job was quickly snapped up by Vice President Dick Cheney, announcing he was best qualified to head the organization. Cheney's Curriculum Vitae included his extensive experience working in the corporate world while head of Halliburton, additional experience in politics, most recently serving as Vice President and having at least one hit under his belt.<br /><br />News leaked out to the BBC that Tony Blair was livid when discovering his name failed to make the short list of applicants. In protest, Blair withdrew three promised peerages, two knighthoods, contracts to rebuild the London bridge, both houses of Parliament, British side of the Chunnel, the controversial pickle building, and a partridge in a pear tree. Blair issued a formal complaint at the Hague.<br /><br />Told he was addressing the wrong body to review his plea, Mr. Blair insisted his qualifications to head the Mafia were substantially greater than those of Mr. Cheney, suggesting that his C. V. could prove he single-handedly managed to start the war in Iraq. He argued that without England, the United States would never have had a coalition. Hence, no war in Iraq or suicide bombers in London. He even sexed up fraudulent documents from Italy promoting the threat of WMD and lastly, boasted of being the god father of the phrase, The people's Princess. Ole.<br /><br />Back to Cheney ~<br /><br />Making an appearance on the Oprah show, final gateway for all career announcements and confessional of horrific personality disorders, Mr. and Mrs. Cheney briefed the hostess, and the world, of their plans to embark upon a new life at an undisclosed location in a cave somewhere below sea level in Sicily. Besides their new cave, they will take over the management of a Pecorino cheese factory. Made of sheep's milk, Cheney will take on the duties of a sheperd. Both promised to send Oprah a wheel of cheese dotted with tasty black pepper corns. Yummy.<br /><br />Always cheerful, Lynn Cheney also had a new children's book to promote about the Mafia which was titled, My Favorite Killing, 96 pages, $29.00, all proceeds going directly to her favorite charity.<br /><br />Written by K.C.

Without a warrant. That's nothing. And it's not news.<br /><br />This is: the snooping into your phone bill is just the snout of the pig of a strange, lucrative link-up between the Administration's Homeland Security spy network and private companies operating beyond the reach of the laws meant to protect us from our government. You can call it the privatization of the FBI -- though it is better described as the creation of a private KGB.<br /><br />********************<br />For the full story, see "Double Cheese With Fear," in Armed Madhouse: Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf and Other Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Class War." ********************<br /><br />The leader in the field of what is called "data mining," is a company, formed in 1997, called, "ChoicePoint, Inc," which has sucked up over a billion dollars in national security contracts.<br /><br />Worried about Dick Cheney listening in Sunday on your call to Mom? That ain't nothing. You should be more concerned that they are linking this info to your medical records, your bill purchases and your entire personal profile including, not incidentally, your voting registration. Five years ago, I discovered that ChoicePoint had already gathered 16 billion data files on Americans -- and I know they've expanded their ops at an explosive rate.<br /><br />They are paid to keep an eye on you -- because the FBI can't. For the government to collect this stuff is against the law unless you're suspected of a crime. (The law in question is the Constitution.) But ChoicePoint can collect if for "commercial" purchases -- and under the Bush Administration's suspect reading of the Patriot Act -- our domestic spying apparatchiks can then BUY the info from ChoicePoint.<br /><br />Who ARE these guys selling George Bush a piece of you?<br /><br />ChoicePoint's board has more Republicans than a Palm Beach country club. It was funded, and its board stocked, by such Republican sugar daddies as billionaires Bernie Marcus and Ken Langone -- even after Langone was charged by the Securities Exchange Commission with abuse of inside information.<br /><br />I first ran across these guys in 2000 in Florida when our Guardian/BBC team discovered the list of 94,000 "felons" that Katherine Harris had ordered removed from Florida's voter rolls before the election. Virtually every voter purged was innocent of any crime except, in most cases, Voting While Black. Who came up with this electoral hit list that gave Bush the White House? ChoicePoint, Inc.<br /><br />And worse, they KNEW the racially-tainted list of felons was bogus. And when we caught them, they lied about it. While they've since apologized to the NAACP, ChoicePoint's ethnic cleansing of voter rolls has been amply assuaged by the man the company elected.<br /><br />And now ChoicePoint and George Bush want your blood. Forget your phone bill. ChoicePoint, a sickened executive of the company told us in confidence, "hope[s] to build a database of DNA samples from every person in the United States ...linked to all the other information held by CP [ChoicePoint]" from medical to voting records.<br /><br />And ChoicePoint lied about that too. The company publicly denied they gave DNA to the Feds -- but then told our investigator, pretending to seek work, that ChoicePoint was "the number one" provider of DNA info to the FBI.<br /><br />"And that scares the hell out of me," said the executive (who has since left the company), because ChoicePoint gets it WRONG so often. We are not contracting out our Homeland Security to James Bond here. It's more like Austin Powers, Inc. Besides the 97% error rate in finding Florida "felons," Illinois State Police fired the company after discovering ChoicePoint had produced test "results" on rape case evidence ... that didn't exist. And ChoicePoint just got hit with the largest fine in Federal Trade Commission history for letting identity thieves purchase 145,000 credit card records.<br /><br />But it won't stop, despite Republican senators shedding big crocodile tears about "surveillance" of innocent Americans. That's because FEAR is a lucrative business -- not just for ChoicePoint, but for firms such as Syntech, Sybase and Lockheed-Martin -- each of which has provided lucrative posts or profits to connected Republicans including former Total Information Awareness chief John Poindexter (Syntech), Marvin Bush (Sybase) and Lynn Cheney (Lockheed-Martin).<br /><br />But how can they get Americans to give up our personal files, our phone logs, our DNA and our rights? Easy. Fear sells better than sex -- and they want you to be afraid. Back to today's New York Times, page 28: "Wider Use of DNA Lists is Urged in Fighting Crime." And who is providing the technology? It comes, says the Times, from the work done on using DNA fragments to identity victims of the September 11 attack. And who did that job (for $12 million, no bid)? ChoicePoint, Inc. Which is NOT mentioned by the Times.<br /><br />"Genetic surveillance would thus shift from the individual [the alleged criminal] to the family," says the Times -- which will require, of course, a national DNA database of NON-criminals.<br /><br />It doesn't end there. Turn to the same newspaper, page 23, with a story about a weird new law passed by the state of Georgia to fight illegal immigration. Every single employer and government agency will be required to match citizen or worker data against national databases to affirm citizenship. It won't stop illegal border crossing, but hey, someone's going to make big bucks on selling data. And guess what local boy owns the data mine? ChoicePoint, Inc., of Alpharetta, Georgia.<br /><br />The knuckleheads at the Times don't put the three stories together because the real players aren't in the press releases their reporters re-write.<br /><br />But that's the Fear Industry for you. You aren't safer from terrorists or criminals or "felon" voters. But the national wallet is several billion dollars lighter and the Bill of Rights is a couple amendments shorter.<br /><br />And that's their program. They get the data mine -- and we get the shaft.<br /><br />Greg Palast is author of Armed Madhouse: Who's Afraid of Osama Wolf?, China Floats Bush Sinks, The Scheme to Steal '08, No Child's Behind Left and Other Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Class War, out June 6.

"It is unseemly for the Vice President to continue to benefit from this company at the same time his Administration funnels billions of dollars to it. The Vice President should sever his financial ties to Halliburton once and for all.</strong><br /><br /><a href="http://bombshelter.org" target="_blank"><div align="left"><img alt="Impeach the Bush Regime!" src="http://www.conspiracyplanet.com/images/ACF17B.jpg" border="0" /></a></div><div align="left"><strong><span>Cheney's shady charitable contributions net $2 million refund</span><br />by clammyc<br /><br />Once again, Cheney lies about not benefiting financially from Halliburton.<br /><br />So, to bring this all back and to summarize, we have this:<br /><br />By exploiting a law that was meant for people to donate to Katrina relief, Cheney was able to net a $2,000,000 tax refund.<br /><br />At least half, if not more if this refund was solely due to their exploiting of this law.<br /><br />In order to do this, they had to write a personal check for over $2,000,000 at the end of 2005.<br /><br />None of the donations were to any Katrina relief organizations.<br /><br />The donations were from income related to Halliburton, which Cheney supposedly had no financial ties to.<br /><br />In any other year, they still would have received a few hundred thousand in tax refunds from this "non-financial tie" to Halliburton, if they donated the proceeds to charity.<br /><br />In each of the prior three years, their donations were never more than 4%-5% of their 2005 totals, the only year that this law applies to.<br /><br />Once again, they flat out lie in their press release by obscuring the million or so that they personally benefited from this transaction.<br /><br />The timing, while not illegal, is extremely self serving and shady, especially in light of the fact that they should not be benefiting financially from any ties to Halliburton.<br /><br />I just fucking hate him.

War Criminals?</span><br />By charlie smith<br /><br />Gail Davidson laid criminal charges against U.S. President George W. Bush. A Provincial Court judge later declared them a "nullity". Mark Mushet photo.<br /><br />Some lawyers claim the U.S. is guilty of crimes against humanity<br /><br />Serving tea in her kitchen in her home on Vancouverâs West Side, Gail Davidson seems more like a friendly neighbour than a wild-eyed revolutionary. Davidson, a grandmother, laughs easily, enjoys gardening, and speaks with a remarkable absence of egotism. In this setting, itâs hard to comprehend that she is a key figure in an international campaign to hold U.S. President George W. Bush accountable for committing war crimes. But that has become her central preoccupation.<br /><br />Davidson, cochair of an international group called Lawyers Against the War (LAW), says she is the only person in the world who has ever laid criminal charges against Bush. On November 30, 2004, Davidson walked into Vancouver Provincial Court and convinced a justice of the peace to accept seven Criminal Code charges against Bush while he was visiting Canada. She brought evidence to support her contention that Bush should be held criminally responsible for counselling, aiding, and abetting torture at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and at a U.S. military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Each offence carries a prison sentence of up to 14 years.<br /><br />On December 6, Provincial Court Judge William Kitchen ruled in an in-camera hearing that those charges were a ânullityâ. In law, this means they never occurred even though they had been approved. Kitchen permitted Davidson to reveal outside the courtroom that his decision was based on Bushâs âdiplomatic immunityâ.<br /><br />LAW cochair Michael Mandel, a law professor at Osgoode Hall law school at York University, claimed in a December 6 news release that Kitchenâs decision was âirregular in procedure and wrong in substanceâ. However, Michael Byers, a UBC expert in global politics and international law, told the Georgia Straight that a sitting head of state always has diplomatic immunity.<br /><br />Davidson told the Straight that she has a âpersonal commitmentâ to ensure that Bush, U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, and others are eventually held accountable. âThey have obviously committed a wide range of international crimes of the most serious nature,â Davidson said. âSo I canât see how members of the United Nations such as Canada can avoid prosecution of those people and still maintain the integrity of their own legal systems.â<br /><br />Davidson is one of dozens of lawyers in different countries who are pursuing Bush and other top U.S. officials through the courts and at citizensâ tribunals. On the same day that Davidson filed her private prosecution against Bush in Vancouver, the New Yorkâbased Center for Constitutional Rights laid war-crimes charges in Germany against Rumsfeld and nine other U.S. military and civilian personnel. LAW joined this action.<br /><br />In February, a German court threw out the case, rejecting CCRâs contention that the U.S. is unwilling to prosecute its own senior officials.<br /><br />CCR president Michael Ratner described the ruling in a news release as âa purely political decisionâ to enable Rumsfeld to attend a security conference in Germany. Wolfgang Kaleck, a German human-rights lawyer who handled the case for CCR, e-mailed the Straight on April 5 saying he is appealing the ruling.<br /><br />In addition, CCR has launched civil suits for military detainees against Bush and other top officials in U.S. courts. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled last June that U.S. courts may review detentions of foreigners at Guantanamo Bay. Last month, U.S. officials revealed that at least 108 people have died in U.S. custody in Iraq and Afghanistan; 26 are confirmed or suspected criminal homicides.<br /><br />CCR is also representing Maher Arar in his lawsuit against former U.S. attorney general John Ashcroft. Arar, a Syrian-Canadian, alleged that in September 2002, U.S. officials yanked him off a plane during a stopover at JFK Airport in New York. Arar claimed he was driven to Maine, put on a plane to Jordan in the Middle East, and driven to Syria, where he was tortured for a year in a tiny cell. Arar has denied any connection to al-Qaeda.<br /><br />U.S. journalist Seymour Hersh, author of Chain of Command: The Road From 9/11 to Abu Ghraib (HarperCollins, 2004), reported that Bush signed a decree creating an unacknowledged âspecial-access programâ. Over a three-year period, Hersh wrote, suspected terrorists were transported under this program to secret prisons in allied countries for harsh interrogations. Hershâs sources claimed that these interrogation techniques were introduced into the Abu Ghraib prison.<br /><br />Last month, the American Civil Liberties Union and Human Rights First, a New Yorkâbased group, filed a 77-page civil suit against Rumsfeld on behalf of eight military detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan. The plaintiffs allege that Rumsfeld âformulated, approved, directed or ratified the torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatmentâ¦as part of a policy, pattern or practiceâ.<br /><br />Hina Shamsi, a New York lawyer with Human Rights First, told the Straight that a great deal of work went into preparing this case. Lawyers worked with human-rights and humanitarian organizations in Iraq and Afghanistan to identify people who had been mistreated in U.S. detention centres. Then the clients had to be interviewed.<br /><br />The civil complaint alleges that, among others, Arkan M. Ali, a 26-year-old Iraqi, âsuffered severe beatings to the point of unconsciousness, stabbing and mutilation, isolation while naked and hooded in a coffin-like box, prolonged sleep deprivation enforced by beatings, deprivation of adequate food and water, mock execution and death threatsâ.<br /><br />The same lawsuit alleges that another Iraqi plaintiff, Sherzad Kamal Khalid, 34, was also subjected to torture, including sexual abuse involving assaults and threats of anal rape. A third, high-school student Ali H., was allegedly dragged from one location to another after surgery, forcefully ripping away the dressing and exposing him to infection. Mehboob Ahmad, a 35-year-old Afghanistan citizen, was allegedly beaten, suspended from the ceiling to cause pain, and intimidated by a vicious dog.<br /><br />The case centres on Rumsfeldâs decision to personally sign off on âunlawfulâ interrogation techniques in December 2002. According to the civil complaint, Rumsfeld âexpressly permitted cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and tolerated or authorized tortureâ.<br /><br />The so-called December Rumsfeld Techniques included the use of âstress positionsâ, 20-hour interrogations, the removal of clothing, and playing upon a detaineeâs phobias to induce stressânone of which are permitted in U.S. army manuals.<br /><br />On January 15, 2003, Rumsfeld rescinded his blanket authorization. The following April, he personally approved 24 techniques, which included âsleep adjustmentâ, âdietary adjustmentâ, and the display of false flags during interrogation to trick detainees. Rumsfeld allegedly ensured that harsher techniques could be used with his personal authorization. The civil complaint doesnât mention the special-access program.<br /><br />âAlthough there has been other lawsuits filed on behalf of detainees for abuse suffered in U.S. detention facilities, none of those have focused on the policy-making role of a top U.S. official,â Shamsi said. âWhat we have done here is connect the dots. We connect the creation of interrogation policies and the beginning of abuse in Afghanistan with the migration of those policies to Iraq.â<br /><br />The plaintiffsâ 17-member legal team includes retired U.S. rear admiral John Huston and retired U.S. brigadier-general James Cullen, who are both lawyers. By press time, Rumsfeld had not filed a response. The ACLU also filed civil suits last month against three senior military officials beneath Rumsfeld, including Lieut.-Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, former commander of U.S. military forces in Iraq.<br /><br />The U.S. Department of Defense issued a news release last month âvigorouslyâ disputing the plaintiffsâ allegations in all four cases against U.S. officials: âNo policies or procedures approved by the Secretary of Defense were intended as, or could conceivably have been interpreted as, a policy of abuse or condoning abuse.â<br /><br />UBCâs Byers said that this type of human-rights litigation in national courts usually has little chance of success. âThis is a way of attracting media attention for the entirely noble purpose of informing the public, and achieving change as a result of public opinion,â he said.<br /><br />The recent lawsuits did not target Bush, who enjoys extra protection under the U.S. Constitution as that countryâs commander-in-chief. On December 21, 2004, the ACLU released a Federal Bureau of Investigation e-mail suggesting that Bush issued an executive order allowing interrogators to use military dogs and permit âsensory deprivation through the use of hoodsâ.<br /><br />Meanwhile, citizensâ tribunals have issued their own rulings, according to a recent LAW newsletter. Following two days of hearings at the London School of Economics in November 2003, a panel of eight international law professors decided there was âsufficient evidenceâ for the International Criminal Court prosecutor to investigate senior U.K. officials for crimes against humanity committed in Iraq.<br /><br />On December 12, 2004, a citizensâ tribunal comprising judges from Korea, Japan, and Indonesia concluded that British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi Junâichiro, and Philippines President Gloria Arroyo âcould be appropriately prosecutedâ. The tribunal found Bush guilty of âtorture and maltreatment of Iraqi detaineesâ.<br /><br />âThey came to the conclusion that Bush and the other people indicted were guilty of a variety of crimes, number one, of course, waging a war of aggression against Afghanistan,â Davidson said. âAlso, they were guilty of using weapons that were prohibited by the laws of war. Some of the weapons that they cited in their judgment were the use of depleted uranium, use of fuel-air explosives such as daisy cutters, cluster bombs, and antipersonnel mines.â<br /><br />In a January 2005 article in Energy Bulletin, Dr. Chris Busby, the U.K. representative on the European Committee on Radiation Risk, claimed that thousands of children all over the world will die from the use of depleted uranium in modern weapons. He noted that radiation from the Chernobyl nuclear-reactor accident reached Wales.<br /><br />Last October, the prestigious British medical journal the Lancet published an epidemiological study that estimated anywhere between 8,000 and 194,000 Iraqis have died because of the war. The leader of the study, Dr. Les Roberts, made a âconservativeâ estimate of 100,000 war-related deaths, according to a BBC report. Iraq Body Count, a British nongovernmental group that tabulates media reports of civilian deaths in Iraq, stated that its number approached 20,000 on the second-year anniversary of the invasion.<br /><br />Iraqi lawyers have demanded that Bush and Blair be charged as war criminals. According to a March 23 story on www.islam-online.net/, Fallujah bar association chairman Kamal Hamdoun claimed that U.S. attacks on his city âare a blatant violation of the Geneva Conventions and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which ban the killing of the wounded, captives and civiliansâ.<br /><br />The Nuremburg Tribunal that prosecuted Nazi leaders described a war of aggression as the âsupreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the wholeâ. LAW cochair Mandel, author of How America Gets Away With Murder: Illegal Wars, Collateral Damage and Crimes Against Humanity (UBC Press, 2004), claimed in his book that the U.S. bore ultimate responsibility for all war-related deaths in Iraq, including those caused by suicide bombers.<br /><br />âEvery death was a crime for which the leaders of the invading coalition were personally, criminally responsible,â Mandel wrote. âWhen General [Vince] Brooks said the soldiers at the Karbala checkpoint were exercising their âinherent right to self-defenseâ he was talking nonsense: an aggressor has no right to self-defense. If you break into someoneâs house and hold them at gunpoint and they try to kill you but you kill them first, theyâre guilty of nothing and youâre guilty of murder.â<br /><br />Human Rights Watch alleged in a 2004 report, The Road to Abu Ghraib, that the Bush administration has âeffectively sought to re-write the Geneva Conventions of 1949 to eviscerate their most important protectionsâ. Those include freedom from humiliating and degrading treatment, as well as from torture. âThe Pentagon and the Justice Department developed the breathtaking legal argument that the president, as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, was not bound by U.S. or international laws prohibiting torture when acting to protect national security, and that such laws might even be unconstitutional if they hampered the war on terror,â it stated.<br /><br />U.S. law professor John Yoo, a former Bush ad?ministration Justice Department lawyer, wrote an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal last year claiming that the war with al-Qaeda is not governed by the Geneva Conventions for two reasons: al-Qaeda is not a state, and its members violate the laws of war by targeting civilians. âWhile Taliban fighters had an initial claim to protection under the conventions (since Afghanistan signed the treaties), they lost POW status by failing to obey the standards of combat for legal combatants: wearing uniforms, a responsible command structure, and obeying the laws of war,â Yoo wrote.<br /><br />Charles Gittings, a Washington state computer programmer, has filed three âamicus curaieâ (friend of the courts) briefs in U.S. courts opposing this legal interpretation. During a recent visit to Vancouver, Gittings told the Straight that he thinks the Bush administration deliberately set out to do an end run around the Geneva Conventions following the September 11 attacks. He cited a November 13, 2001, presidential military order, which gave Rumsfeld wide latitude in dealing with detainees.<br /><br />Gittings has alleged that the treatment of detainees violates a 1996 U.S. federal statute banning war crimes. The law carries the death penalty. When Gittings was asked what his goal is in pursuing these cases, he replied: âGeorge Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, John Ashcroft, and everybody down the line in prison, serving probably life sentences for their crimes, actually.â<br /><br />The ACLU and other groups have urged U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to appoint an outside special counsel to investigate. Gonzales, as the former White House counsel, wrote a memo in January 2002 advising Bush that the Geneva Conventions didnât apply to enemy combatants in Afghanistan.<br /><br />Gail Davidson isnât holding out much hope that Bush administration officials will ever be punished in the United States, but she doesnât rule out the possibility of it occurring elsewhere. She said there is certainly enough latitude under Canadaâs Crimes Against Humanity and War Crimes Act to prosecute senior Bush administration officials if they visit Canada after leaving office. However, charges under this act must be approved by the attorney general of Canada, Irwin Cotler.<br /><br />âI think we still have a great reluctance to see our kings decrowned and prosecuted,â Davidson said. âHow many years after the Magna Carta are we? That was 1215. And we still arenât absolutely comfortable with somebody crying that the king is naked.â<br /><br />According to the Canadaâs War Crimes Program annual report, the policy is unequivocal: âCanada will not be a safe haven for persons involved in war crimes, crimes against humanity or other reprehensible acts.â<br /><br />The annual report states that 2,608 persons complicit in war crimes or crimes against humanity have been prevented from entering Canada. Another 325 were deported.<br /><br />So far, none of them have been high-ranking officials in the Bush administration.<br /><br /></strong><span><span><span><u><strong>The Revolution Will Be Televized</strong></u></span> </span></span><br /><div align="left"><span><strong>If you live on the Island of Hawai'i</strong></span><span></div><span></span></span><div align="left"><span><strong>Watch our FutureWorks FilmLabs<br />Cable Access Festival every week!</strong></span><span><br /></div><span></span></span><div align="left"><span><strong><span>Sundays 3-4 pm and Mondays 11pm to Midnight<br /></span></span><span><span>Channel 54</span></strong></span></div><span><div align="left"></span><span> </div><span></span></span><div align="left"><span><strong>If you live on the Island of Maui</strong></span><span><br /></div><span></span></span><a href="http://www.akaku.org/xtv_frames.shtml/" target="_blank"><div align="left"><span><img alt="XTV Revolutionizes TV user interface!" src="http://www.akaku.org/graphics/logos/x_tv_Logos.gif" border="0" /></span></div></a><span><div align="left"> </div><span></span></span><div align="left"><span><strong>Go to XTV<br />& program one of our shows yourself!<br />Then watch it on Channel 54 at your convenience!</strong></span><span></div><span></span></span><div align="left"><br /><a href="http://www.akaku.org/xtv_frames.shtml" target="_blank"><span><span>Maui XTV Interface!!!<br />Click Here for search &amp; selection form!</span></a></span></div><div align="left"><br /></div><div align="left"><span><strong><span>Request a Bombshelter Broadcast Program:<br /></span></span><span><span>5115 Revolution Televized Pt. 1<br />5801 Earth Wrenches and Anarchy<br />5256 Orwell Rolls in His Grave 1<br />4941 Uncovered Pt2 - Behind Iraq<br />5763 Bush Family Fortunes </span></strong></span></div>
