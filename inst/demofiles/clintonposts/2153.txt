<br />I'm now sitting in a friend's apartment in Los Angeles surrounded by gear for the next segment of the summer adventure.  Jason is frantically telling me to get something posted to the blog before we run to the airport in twenty minutes for a midnight flight to Costa Rica.  We'll promise to be a little more diligent about updates during the next month!<br />
<br />The last adventure in Maui was visiting the summit and crater of Haleakala.   We were lucky and landed a cancellation for one of the three cabins and had a little overnight backpacking trip.  The above photo gives you an idea of the immense scale of the crater itself at an elevation of 10,000 feet.<br />

<br />Not quite the Hillary and Tenzeng expedition, but a pretty tough band of adventurers.  All of us were in pretty good spirits in the beginning, but notice the footwear on Sharon and Joe.  This turned out to be a poor decision on loose volcanic rock.   Note for future visits.<br />

<div>The above was most likely a sulfur vent and was once believed to be bottomless by the native Hawaiians.  In turn, some drug induced hippies during the 1970s threw themselves into the vent and discovered it was only 65 feet deep.   Ouch.  The natives believed that tossing in the placentas of their newborns would provide increased strength and health during the course of their children's lives<br />

<br />We were greeted at out cabin by a pair of Nene, the Hawaiian State bird.  They are the most endangered geese in the world and almost lost two more of the species when five hungry hikers found them at Holua.<br />

<br />Do not feed the Nene.  Giving them water is OK though.<br />

<div>This shot was taken the following morning during the grueling climb back out of the crater.  We were actually photographed on the hike out for the cover of next year's Haleakala brochure!  Keep your fingers crossed!<br />
