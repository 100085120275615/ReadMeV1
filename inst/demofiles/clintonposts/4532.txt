<p>I don&#8217;t usually repost content from other blogs, mostly because if you wanted to read the other blog, I figure you would have found it already. But this made me scream out loud:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://fakegaynews.com/index.php/2006/08/iowa-not-like-dar-williams-song-report-disappointed-lesbians/">Iowa Not Like Dar Williams Song, Report Disappointed Lesbians</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>âI thought Iowa would help me find a way to say âI love youâ to Latonya,â confessed passenger Hillary Uxbridge. âI had it all planned out in my head. I would tell her, and then sheâd say that she feared that to fall in love with me would be to fall from a great and gruesome height. And then we would make out.â</p>

<p>Since I have actually experienced this same disappointment with Iowa, well except I had someone to make out with, I felt this post deserved some pimpin&#8217;. Not that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fakegaynews.com/">FakeGayNews.com </a>needs any help from my little blog.</p>
<p>Also worth noting over there: <a target="_blank" href="http://fakegaynews.com/index.php/2006/08/knocked-up-lesbian-has-some-explaining-to-do/">Knocked Up Lesbian Has Some Explaining To Do</a></p>
