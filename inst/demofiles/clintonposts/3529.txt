<div>Since I devoted the previous post to Hillary, I thought Iâd write about George W. at this one, in the spirit of bipartisanship.  <br />
<br />I saw the President on TV yesterday poking fun at himself at <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/30/bush.press.dinner.ap/index.html">the annual dinner for the White House Correspondents Association,</a> with Steve Bridges alongside impersonating him.  He looks convincingly just like George W.  I couldnât stop laughing.  <br />
<br />Poking fun at his oratory skills, George W. said at one point:  âI continue to spread our agenda globally and around the world, as well as internationally,â to howls of laughter from media people.  <br />
<br />The president wasnât the only butt of jokes last night.  âWhereâs the Great White Hunter?â Bridges asked.   <br />
<br />The president responded:  âIâm sorry Dick Cheney couldnât be here tonight.â<br />
<br />âDick Cheneyâs such a goof ball,â Bridges continued.  âHe shot the only trial lawyer in the country who is for me.â<br />
<br />So this is good. Mocking oneself in front of the press and media people who are some of his most harshest critics is disarming, and endearing.  <br />
<br />âLadies and gentlemen,â the president said, âI am feeling chipper tonight.  I survived the White House shakeup.â<br />
<br />But I think the best line was when Bush tried to repeat his impersonatorâs words.  Bridges said: "We must enhance non-compliance protocols sanctioned not only at IAEA formal sessions, but through intercessional contact." <br />
<br />And Bush repeated:   "We must enhance non-compliance protocols sanctioned not only at E-I-E-I-O sessions, but through intersexual conduct."</div>
