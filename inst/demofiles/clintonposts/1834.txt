<br />Just when I was thinking I had cornered Cool-Mom market, my kids jumped in to save me. <br />
<br />Cierra (my 6 year old says to me, "Mom, do you know you look just like that lady who is on the cover of the magazine by the couch."  My ears perked up. "Really??" I asked.  <br />
<br />Mentally I reviewed every rag mag I've bought in the last several weeks. I couldn't wipe the smile off my face. In deed this was going to be just the ego boost my, "not feeling so cute" day needed. I grinned and replied, "That's so nice.  Which on?"  <br />
<br />Now in my head I've already narrowedd it down to either Jessica Simpson (curvacious, young, beautiful blonde - fabulous comparison and Cierra is due for a raise in her allowance). I also thought the possibilities of it being Britney Spears (a bit chubby faced at the moment, and going through a bit of a white-trashy phase at the moment, but again....young, pretty and nothing to sneeze at).  Other blonde frequenteirs of the Star, People, US, InStyle, all made breif appearances in my mind. Could it be Reese Whitherspoon? <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3915/1138/1600/xin_04010320154904001691.0.jpg">

<br />Oh, I know... It must be Heather Locklear. My husband likes to think we look alike. No, no, no she's too old for Cierra to see a comparison.<br />

<br />"Cierra, show Mommy which lady you're talking about."  Together we walked to the pile of magazines. I watched with excited anticipation as she pulled from the stack a copy of Orange Coast Magazine.  It wasn't Jessica Simpson on the cover.  My heart sank to my knees and my ego face planted on the floor, an irriversable dive. On the cover was <br />
