<span>cindy sheehan is a brave woman. i believe in what she represents: a broken-hearted, patriotic american, disappointed and let down by her country's president who was elected to promote and protect the best interests of the american people, but has only promoted and protected the best interests of the american oil companies, who continue to get rich from the pockets of the people at the mercy of the gas pump. isn't it crazy how we barely have a livable wage system, yet we still manage to pay for the war in iraq, our cars and suvs that get lousy gas mileage, and the astronomically priced gas for those guzzlers, but it's the mega rich who get the tax breaks?

i just took a look at cindy's website. it speaks alot for a military mom to take a stand for the life of her son. please visit her site and offer her your support. </span><a href="http://meetwithcindy.org/"><span>http://meetwithcindy.org/</span></a><span> </span>
<span>from there you can link to </span><a href="http://www.meetwiththemothers.org/"><span>http://www.meetwiththemothers.org/</span></a><span> and look up your state to find out if your congressmen and representatives were brave enough to meet with cindy and the mothers. (major props to <a href="http://www.meetwiththemothers.org/userdata_display.php?modin=50&uid=421">Sen. Hillary Clinton [D, NY]</a> and <a href="http://www.meetwiththemothers.org/userdata_display.php?modin=50&amp;uid=299">Rep. Charles Rangel [D, NY-15]</a> )

you should also contact you representatives and tell them how you feel about our sons-daughters-husbands-wives-moms-dads dying for this ignoble cause.

okay, i'll get off my soapbox... for now. but I warn you. i feel another political post brewing... beware! </span>
