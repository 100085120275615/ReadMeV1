Sen. Chris Dodd will be heading out to Iowa and New Hampshire next month to test the presidential waters, according to <a href="http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-dodd0828.artaug28,0,6341014.story?coll=hc-headlines-home">the<i> Courant</i></a>. His biggest problems right now are his late start, and low name recognition: <blockquote>Earlier this month, at least six candidates visited the Iowa State Fair, a favorite and well-publicized stop for political hopefuls. A local television station poll at the fair found former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, the party's 2004 vice presidential nominee, and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton tied among Democrats with 33 percent each.<br /><br />Dodd was not among the 10 candidates mentioned in the survey.</blockquote><br />However, as the article mentions, Dodd is well-known among some of the party faithful because of his brief stint as the head of the DNC during the mid-1990s (a glorious time for Democrats), and he has already raised about $2 million. He also has good connections in New Hampshire and has the added benefit of being a northeasterner, although that didn't help Joe Lieberman. <br /><br />I suspect that it won't help Dodd, either. The only northeastern senator with a shot this time around is Hillary Clinton, and Dodd is not a convincing alternative to her.<br /><br />We'll keep an eye on the Dodd campaign as it develops, although a lukewarm reception next month could spell its end.<br /><br /><i>Source</i><br />Lightman, David.
