<br />And hell, I can think of dozens. I HATE self checkout.  Self-checkout, IMHO, is a frickin' plot to make me the customer help Kroger and whatnot to make as much money off of me while providing as few jobs as possible.  And it rarely does smotthly. and there are a gajillion people standing around looking anxious while I do it.  And there's always some dumbass employee standing at the <span>opposite</span> end of the self-checkout cattle chute tapping his or her toes and looking anxious at the same time.  In one phrase: too much scrutiny.</div>
