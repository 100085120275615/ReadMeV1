<p>It seems that this Baptist Minister is bringing his own preconceived notions to the idea of women and the presidency.  That, and his understanding of grammar sucks.</p>
	<p>The word &#8220;he&#8221; is often used on a gender-neutral basis to refer to men and women alike.  Similarly, we refer to cars and other inanimate objects, like the country, as &#8220;she&#8221;.  This guy has lost it.  I don&#8217;t want Hillary to be our next president, but I want her to lose at the ballot box, not based on some chauvinistic reading of the constitution.</p>

According to a Baptist Minister, the U.S. Constitution prevents Hillary Rodham Clinton - or any woman - from serving as President. He says that contrary to what feminists think, the 19th Amendment did not de-gender the nationâs highest office. Article II, Section 1 declares 16 times the President will be a man.</p>
	<p>Thatâs right, men only. Women need not apply.</p></blockquote>
