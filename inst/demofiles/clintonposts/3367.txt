<div>LAST NIGHT Democratic Senatorial candidate Ned Lamont defeated incumbent Senator  Joseph Liberman in Connecticut's Democratic primary. Liberman vows that he will continue his campaign <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060809/ap_on_el_se/primary_elections">as an independent</a>, potentially dividing Democratic voters and  aiding the Republican challenger.<br />
<br />Frankly, this isn't all too shocking because Joe Liberman has been outside the Democratic mainstream for a long time now. Pundits keep mentioning that the Senator has fallen far since he was a vice presidential candidate in 2000 but they seem to forget why Al Gore picked him as his running mate. Soured by Clintoinfidelity problems, Gore picked Liberman  because he was the staunchest Democrat to criticize  Clinton, not because he was well-liked or popular within the party.</div>
