<a href="http://www.ericscheske.com/blog/?p=1924">Interesting post at the Daily Eudemon</a> on actress Kate Hudson's views on marriage and monogamy:</span>
<br />  <span>
<span>
<blockquote>ââ<a href="http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2005/08/06/keeping_the_faith/">I donât believe [monogamy] is realistic</a>. But I believe that we, as people, have the power to make it happen.â She added: ââI will not disrespect my husband and stray.â ...Asked if she believes [her husband] has remained faithful, Hudson said, ââIf for some reason, thatâs what he has to go do, I just donât want to know. As long as things are good in our house, just please, donât get caught.â</blockquote>
</span>
</span> <span> When she says monogamy is "not practical", I believe she means "not natural." Which is true, it isn't. It takes an enormous amount of discipline, but it is achievable. Hudson's views here are entirely healthy. It is important to recognize that the institution of marriage is a constant battle against biology and human nature. If one fails to acknowledge this, they can't possibly forge the weapons needed to fight the battle.</span>
<br /> <br />
<span>Where Miss Hudson's views become unhealthy and where her acknowlegement of the difficulties of monogamy become moral surrender is in her explicit endorsement of a Hillary Clinton/Carmela Soprano "don't ask, don't tell" policy on marital fidelity. Many women, especially among the affluent, have some fashion of this policy with varying degrees of consciousness. </span>
<br /> <br />
<span> If a man keeps his wife happy (i.e. keeps the money coming in, cares for his children, attends to his wife's sexual needs on at least a basic level), he can get away with a moderate amount of discreet infidelity. It's not that these women don't care or don't suspect. They simply aren't going to look that hard. A happy woman is simply not going to go on the hunt without reason. However, start neglecting your children, stop holding up your end in the bedroom, fail to keep enough steaks in the freezer and you will get caught. Highly immoral and sad, but it is reality for many, many people.</span>
