<div>In my afternoon class at summer school, I'm teaching 11 kids who have just finished kindergarten and are going into grade one. So they're five, maaaybe six. Two of the kids, a boy and a girl, have been inseparable since the beginning of summer school. Today, Safad* came up to me and announced: "Miss Hillary, Susanne* just kissed me."<br />
<br />I laughed to myself, thinking, there's got to be some appropriate teacher-y thing to say here, but I have no idea what it is. I was too amused to think of anything quick enough. These kids are little. They do stuff like that. Honestly, I think it's just super cute, as long as it doesn't get out of hand.<br />
<br />"Oh. What do you want me to do?"<br />
<br />He grinned. "Nothing." And off he went, back to the special teacher's chair to scrunch up with Suzanne and finish reading the book they were sharing.<br />
<br />I called over to Suzanne, "Suzanne, I know Safad is your friend, but we don't kiss at school."<br />
<br />She called back, with all the innocence of a child:<br />"I know. I couldn't<em> help</em> it. I just LIKE him sooo much!"<br />_____________<br />* Names changed</div>
