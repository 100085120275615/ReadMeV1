I didn't have time to peruse through other right/conservative sites, so I don't know if I'm a minority opinion here...<br /><br />Despite all the best efforts by well-meaning abstinence educators -we have millions of "unwanted pregnancies" in the United States each year and that number translates into millions of abortions. I would rather see women take the overdose of progesterone <i>before</i> the embryo attaches to the uterine wall and becomes viable than after when it would need to be sucked from her womb limb by limb.  Though I am very pro-life, I'm not a subscriber to the "every sperm is sacred" theory...<br /><br />I don't buy the argument being offered by "conservative groups" that this pill will "encourage promiscuity". (If I moved somewhere that allowed prostitution and heroin I still wouldn't partake in either...the fact that it was legal wouldn't change my own convictions.)<br /><br />Here's the thing though, this decision better <i>drastically</i> decrease those abortion statistics. It's easy, cheap, convenient and women will have NO excuse to have abortions when they could have handled their business in a less barbaric manner...<br /><br />(*Remember: The "Morning After Pill" and the "Abortion Pill" (RU-486) are very <a href="http://nydailynews.healthology.com/nydailynews/15417.htm">different drugs</a> -Plan B will not <i>end</i> a pregnancy, just <i>prevent</i> one.*)
