<div>Yes, I know it's still four years off, and probably not where we should be focusing our collective energies at the moment, but the rumors are already flying, and so far, I'm not too thrilled with them.
<br />
<br />Rumor #1: Hillary Clinton in 2008. I like Hillary Clinton. I think she would make a fine president. But not in 2008, and if that means never, then so be it. Hillary Clinton would more than likely be to the left what George W. Bush is to the right. She will energize the Democratic base just as Bush has energized the Republican base. She will return liberalism to the White House just as Bush brought conservatism back to the White House after Bill Clinton. The result will most likely be the same problem we are experiencing now: a divided nation. The only difference will which half of the country is happy, and which is not. Like I said, Hillary Clinton could make a great president, but she is simply ahead of her time. Who knows what the next four years will bring, but I'm going to go out on limb here and predict that George Bush won't do much to bring the country together, nor will he care much about doing so, and working for all Americans, not just half of them. Thus, what America will need in 2008 will be someone who can and will do what George Bush cannot and will not: re-unite the United States of America.
<br />
<br />Rumor #2: John Kerry in 2008. Again. I don't know how true this one is, but I hope it's 100% fiction. As I said above, we will need someone who can bring this country together in 2008, and that someone is most decidedly not John Kerry. While he may be willing to try to bring the country together, it is not a goal he will be able to achieve. While there would more than likely be some exceptions, a Kerry run in 2008 would invariably attract the same people who voted for him two weeks ago, and push those who voted for Bush to his Republican opponent. Whether Kerry wins that race or not, our nation's biggest problem would continue to thrive until at least 2012.
<br />
<br />I know I keep saying it, but since it doesn't seem to be setting in with much of the country, I'm going to continue to say it again and again: this nation needs to be brought back together. Unfortunately, there are painfully few politicians who both understand and are capable of achieving that most important of goals. Let's hope we see one of their names on the ballot in 2008.
