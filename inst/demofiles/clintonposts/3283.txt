<div>In a great show of solidarity with American soccer fans, Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) and Sen. John Kerry (D-MA) quickly drafted a bill to pull our soccer team from Germany.  The bill was put together during the halftime of today's match against Ghana as the U.S. was on the losing side of the 2-1 partial result.<br />
<br />According to Kerry, "the U.S. team had already lost two of its best men in a match against Italy last Saturday. Any further losses will severely hurt our chances of winning again here at home."<br />
<br />The bill was defeated 97-2 with Sen. Chuck Schummer (D-NY) abstaining.</div>
