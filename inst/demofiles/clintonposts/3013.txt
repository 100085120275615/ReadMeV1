<div>ELECTION RETURNS SHOW DEMOCRATS LOST DECEASED VOTE
<br />     --Heralds A Graveyard Shift?
<br />     An analysis of election results from the 2004 presidential election shows erosion of Democratic support in many of the party's traditional bases of support--women, Catholics, etc.  Another traditionally Democratic base which may be trending Republican is the deceased voter segment of the electorate.  While in years past, especially in Illinois, cemeteries could be counted on to come in late and heavy for the Democratic nominee, this year saw dead voters decidedly turning to Bush.  "The current Democratic issues like Social Security, fiscal responsibility, and Iraq," one analyst said, "just aren't getting traction with the deceased, for obvious reasons, I guess.  The truth is, a lot of these voters are in Limbo, and the swing issue for them is really which candidate claims to have the best rapport with Heaven, and I guess the gut feeling here was that that candidate might be Bush."
<br />     Democratic leaders say that the loss of Mayor Richard Daley has never been felt more than this year, with many Democrats stating they could only imagine what Daley could have done with the uncounted provisional votes in Ohio.  "We've got to realize that 1960 and Mayor Daley aren't coming back, and our dominance in the cemeteries is over," one Democratic leader said.  "For one thing, Mayor Daley could credibly offer dead voters good jobs on the government payroll.  Also, Nixon was never that closely associated with the religious issue."  "We're getting killed above and below ground," said another leader, "we've just got to come up with a better way to reach these people."
