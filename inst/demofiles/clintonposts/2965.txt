<div>By any stretch of the imagination, Joe Lieberman (and I think by inference, ALL traditional Democrats) is in a real battle as he tries to fend off cable millionaire Ned Lamont for Lieberman's Senate seat in Connecticut.  Great analysis <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/012/417qzbtn.asp">here from Matthew Continentti of <span>The Weekly Standard</span>
</a>.  As Continentti details, one of the most interesting parts of this race has been watching the reaction of current Democrat senators.  Only a few have come out in support of Lieberman; most (including Hillary Clinton) are saying they'll support the party's primary winner.  I would think that "mainstream" (for whatever that word is worth) Democrats are very interested in how this race plays out.  If Lamont pulls off the upset, look for the far-left "New Democrats" to be extremely energized and, in turn, mount challenges in the future against many of those who currently are, in essence, staying on the sidelines (or are very weak in their support of Lieberman).  Either way, the Democrat party is experiencing the first tremors of what could be a seismic shift.  It has become, for all practical purposes, a party where "right turns are NOT allowed."</div>
