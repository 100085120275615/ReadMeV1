<div>Well, apparently the democrats in Connecticut are so unhappy about Senator Joseph Lieberman's support for the war in Iraq (the war that Jean Bethke Elshtain calls 'responsible'), that they were willing to nominate someone with basically no political experience just to send the message: "we don't support the war in Iraq!"  Is Senator Lieberman listening?  <br />
<br />Is Hillary Clinton listening?  She has, to my disappointment, been a supporter of the Iraq War.  Last week, she finally criticized the war, calling for the resignation of Donal Rumsfeld.  About time, Hillary!  You supported the war when you thought it was popular, and only recently, when you realized it was becoming unpopular, you started questioning it.  Perhaps Hillary had an eye toward Connecticut when she called for Rumsfeld's resignation.<br />
<br />Are there any Democrats listening?  The only Democrats I can think of who unequivocally spoke out against the war from the very beginning were Howard Dean and Jimmy Carter.  I am tired of these Democrats who are just now becoming anti-war, when they realize it helps them politically.  They are just hopping on the anti-war bandwagon.<br />
<br />Re-elect Jimmy Carter as the next president of the United States!</div>
