<p>Two of New York&#8217;s potential 2008 White House contenders are hosting interesting visitors today.</p>
<p>U.S. Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-NY, <a href="http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060825/NEWS05/608250383/1026/NEWS10">will meet</a> at her Chappaqua, Westchester County home with anti-war Connecticut Democratic primary winner Ned Lamont - a fascinating guest, given that she will face off here in New York against her own anti-warÂ primary challenger, Jonathan Tasini, in just three weeks.</p>
<p>Clinton, whoÂ has drawn ire from Tasini and other left-leaning Dems by voting for the Iraq War and subsequently refusing to call for an exact timetable for withdrawal of troops, told reportersÂ yesterday that the meeting was Lamont&#8217;s idea.</p>
<p>She said the two would discuss &#8220;a full range of issues,&#8221; which might - or might not - include the war.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/hill_hosts_a_dove_in_for_lamont_nationalnews_ian_bishop__post_correspondent.htm">According to the New York Post</a>, Clinton will be offering Lamont advice on how to defeat now-independent candidate U.S. Sen. Joe Lieberman in a general election. The same Joe LiebermanÂ she backed when he was running as a Democrat just a few short weeks ago, and with whom her husband campaigned in the days before the Connecticut primary.Â </p>
<p>Clinton aides told the Post the senator has already cut Lamont a check from her political action committee, HillPAC.</p>
<p>Lamont told the Post that unlike Lieberman, Clinton learned her lesson on the war.Â She supported the Reid-Levin amendment, which calls for withdrawal, but sets no specific date. Lieberman was one of only five Dems who didn&#8217;t vote for the amendment. Clinton has also been highly critical of the Bush administration forÂ its handling of the war.Â Â </p>
<p>A few hours to the North, Gov. George Pataki <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/washington/25campaign.html?ref=washington">will be hosting</a> 15 Republican state senators from New Hampshire - still home to the first GOP presidential primary contest, although (so far) no longer for the Dems - at the Saratoga racetrack asÂ part of his ongoing effort to curry favor with key party members nationwide as he eyes a possible White House run.

<p>(Look for that tidbit on Page 2Â in the Web version of Adam Nagourney&#8217;s piece about the rush by &#8216;08 hopefuls to snap up consultants and operatives, who, it turns out, are in short supplyÂ compared toÂ the number of would-be candidates). Â </p>
<p>Pataki is also holding his annual governor&#8217;s day at the races fundraiser today, the proceeds of which he&#8217;ll be splitting with the state Republican Party. GOP gubernatorial nominee John Faso will also be at the track, raising money for his own run.</p>
<p>The two Republicans <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/25/nyregion/25york.html">ate their way through</a> the first day of the State Fair in Syracuse yesterday, making sure to hitÂ an all-important sausage sandwich stand.</p>
<p>They were joined by GOP state comptroller candidate J. Christopher Callaghan and GOP/Conservative U.S. Senate candidate John Spencer, both of whom also ate sausage-and-pepper heroes.</p>
<p>Spencer&#8217;s Republican primary opponent, KT McFarland, at the fair for her first day back on the campaign trail after a brief suspension to handle her daughter&#8217;s shoplifting arrest, begged off consuming sausage, as she was heading to the Onondaga County GOP clam bake, but promised to return toÂ do her gustatory duty.Â
