So, ummmm...Ned Lamont won. &nbsp;Hooray for us, right? &nbsp;Hooray for all those CT activists, right?</p><p><br />Well, yes. &nbsp;The blogs helped support a groundswell of grassroots activism on the ground in CT, and lots of people worked their butts off to make this happen.</p><p><br /><b>But gimme a break people. &nbsp;We didn't do this--not the bloggers, and not the CT activists.</b></p><p><br />This was never our race to win. &nbsp;It was Joe Lieberman's to lose. &nbsp;More specifically, it was the DLC's to lose.</p><p><br /><i>And, as usual, the DLC lost. &nbsp;Again.</i> &nbsp;With that ever familiar 48% number staring them in the face.</p><p><br />Let's face some cold, hard facts, people. &nbsp;We didn't do this, because what we supposedly DID was <i>impossible</i> to do--in any politcal climate. &nbsp;</p><p><br />In one corner, you had a bunch of unpaid volunteers, Internet rabble-rousers, and an inexperienced politician whose highest post had been County Selectman.</p><p><br />In the other, you had the <b>three-time Senator, former vice-presidential candidate, visible party statesman, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, the other popular CT senator Dodd, most of Organized Labor, the women's groups and the environmental groups, most of traditional Democratic party support, paid lobbyist support, paid armies of GOTV staff, the slick ad money, the top DLC consultants, and a 3 to 1 budget gap.</b></p><p><br />I'm sorry. &nbsp;That's not David vs. Goliath. &nbsp;This isn't even the NBA champions versus a rec league team.<i>That's more like an ant vs. my shoe.</i></p><p><br />And the shoe lost.</p><p><br />-------------------------</p><p><br />But then, the DLC is an old shoe--and the most politically incompetent shoe I've ever seen. &nbsp;<b>The truth is that the DLC couldn't beat my dead great-grandmother.</b> &nbsp;Or yours.</p><p><br />They couldn't beat their own shadow. &nbsp;<i>So why did anyone think they could beat Karl Rove?</i></p><p><br />----------------------------</p><p><br />Honestly, the GOP doesn't need Diebold to win elections. &nbsp;All it needs is to have the DLC as an opponent.</p><p><br />America underestimates just how far we've been sold down the river by these incompetent DLC clowns. Let me repeat this again:</p><p><br />A three-time Senator, former vice-presidential candidate, visible party statesman, Bill Clinton, Hillary Clinton, Harry Reid, Barbara Boxer, the other popular CT senator Dodd, most of Organized Labor, the women's groups and the environmental groups, most of traditional Democratic party support, the slick ad money, the top DLC consultants, lobbyist support, armies of paid GOTV staff, and a 3 to 1 budget gap <i>couldn't beat a freaking County Selectman and his unpaid volunteers.</i></p><p><br />In fact, all that DLC institutional support garnered THE SAME 48% AGAINST US THAT IT GARNERED AGAINST GEORGE W. BUSH. &nbsp;The DLC had to turn the guns of 6 presidential candidates in a circular firing squad to bring down Howard Dean.</p><p><br />You see, I don't think Karl Rove's a genius. &nbsp;I think that America has been served with the biggest bunch of political mental midgets it has seen since the Know Nothing Party--or since the Pennsylvania Greens, take your pick.</p><p><br />I think that these people who get paid the big bucks for no other reason than to WIN ELECTIONS, couldn't win an election for elementary school class president--especially given equal resources with its 5th grade opponent.</p><p><br />And the result of that is an bumbling, evil idiot for a president who should never have held a second term in the first place if we had had anything but total bumbling idiots for a political opposition party.</p><p><br />And a nation in shambles.</p><p><br />-------------------------------</p><p><br />It's time to rout them ALL out, one by one.</p><p><br />Republicans have lies backed by money and power. &nbsp;We have the truth, backed by unpaid energy, little money and no power.</p><p><br /><i><b>The DLC has proved that no matter what advantage it begins with, it's incapable of beating either.</b></i></p><p><br />It's time to take them behind the woodshed and put the poor, useless creatures out of their misery and get some fresh blood in there.</p><p><br />Even my dead great-grandma's. &nbsp;She'd be a better bet to get more than 48% of an election.<br /></p><p>
