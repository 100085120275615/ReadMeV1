<div align="justify">I am currently dealing with post-partum depression. T0-night, for the first time since I was 18, I am going to bed outside what George H.W. Bush called "the Big Tent of the Republican Party." I reregistered this day as an American Independent.</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">My annoyance with the G.O.P. has been growing for a long time, and I suppose this step wasinevitable since the time I voted third party back in the 80s, when pro-abort Republican Ed Schau was running to unseat pro-abort Senator Cranston. Why this action?</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">Well, of course, as a committed Monarchist, I never really liked the party name. But beyond that there was the growing conviction that I was simpky participating in a meaningless political ritual, a sort of political Kabuki. Apart from tone and rhetoric, it becomes increasingly obvious that there is little or no difference between the policies of the Clinton and Bush II administrations. Whether or not one is pro-Iraq war, the fact remains that our intervention there was conducted according to the Clinton Doctrine, the idea that we would intervene anywhere we deemed a threat, regardless of national sovereignty. The feminisation and homosexualisation of the military continues apace, there will be no advocates of overturning Roe v. Wade appointed to the High Court, and on and on.</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">Yet the G.O.P. continue to take the "social conservative" vote for granted, all the while giving them nothing, materially. The Democrats do the same to their core constituencies, the minorities and organised labour. The central committes of both parties have more in common with each other than with their own rank and file. (Of course, the SC, labour, and minorities have much more in common with each other than either do with their party leadersip).</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">The rivalry between the two parties is more apparent than real. The British, Canadians, Australians, and subjects of various other Crown Commonwealth realms are wonderful for their own empty political rituals. The openings of Parliament by the Queen, Governors-General and other viceroys always showcase the Monarch or her standins offering the "Speech from the Throne, in which she or they offer the current government's agenda (although she menions "my government in the course of the oration, she has no control over the contents pf what she utters.</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">This is responded to by the "Address-in-Reply." Debate over this introduction constitutes the first debate on new policies. The debate may be lively, but the formla of the address is unchanging. The version used in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales is typical:</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">"To His/HerExcellency [name of the Governor], Governor of the State of New South Wales in the Commonwealth of Australia.</div>
<div align="justify">MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCY___We,the Members of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our thanks for Your Excellency's speech, and to express our loyalty to the Sovereign.</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">2. We assure Your Excellency that our earnest consideration will be given to the measures to be submitted to us, that we will faithfully carry out the important duties entrusted to us by the people of New South Wales, and that the necessary provision for the Public Services will be made in due course.</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">3. We join Your Excellency in the hope that our labours may be so directed as to advance the best interests of all sections of the community."</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">It would be easy to smile at the idea of the primarily republican NSW Assembly expressing their loyalty to the Sovereign, considering how many of its members want to overthrow the Monarchy. But it is no more fanciful than the Governor referring to "My Government" during the throne speech.</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">Now, so long as the republicrats have a lock on power, our elections are essentially meaningless exercises in Kabuki (admittedly without the beauty or grace of that ancient Japanese artform). I wish it were not so (though, to be sure, I wish that Speeches from the Throne and Addresses in Reply meant what they said too). But things are as they are, not as we would wish.</div>
<div align="justify"> </div>
<div align="justify">Friends have told me that voting Third Party is a waste of vote; but having voted Republlican all my life, with the likes of Anthony Kennedy as reward, I think that I have been doing so my entire adult life. Perhaps, now, my voting really will mean something!</div>
