<p>I am slowly readjusting to regular life and trying to get things sorted out around here. This is made more difficult by a cold with a pesky cough that&#8217;s been keeping me up at night. I was looking forward to getting lots of crafting time in now that my school work&#8217;s all done (yay!) but it seems that will have to wait a bit longer while I mope about on the couch and in bed watching bad television and drinking juice.</p>
	<p>In the meantime, here are my bunny and kitty from <a href="http://weewonderfuls.typepad.com/">Hillary&#8217;s</a> great pattern book that I made for my niece. She seemed to enjoy them and gave them some funny nonsense names that I can&#8217;t remember. I liked how they turned out too, and they were really easy to make. As some of the first stuffed things that I have made I thought it would be hard, but not at all!</p>
