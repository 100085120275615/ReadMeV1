<span>So . . . I suppose I can't start a commentary on politics without discussing the upcoming election.  Normally, I find election seasons rather exciting, but I have to say, this one has been a real snore.  Memo to John Kerry:  There are millions of voters in the United States, like me, who were born during or after the Vietnam War.  To us, it has all the relevance of the Great Depression - as a chapter in a history textbook.  I think I speak for a lot of my peers when I say, "What have you done during OUR lifetimes?"  Aside from my other reservations about Senator Kerry - and they are legion - I just have to wonder about a man for whom the last thing he did of which he was proud, apparently, was over 30 years ago.</span>

<span>What is it with liberals that they always seem to miss the point?  From "You weren't in Vietnam" to "It's just about sex", they not only aren't on the same page with the rest of us, they don't even seem to be reading the same book.  Sometimes, they don't appear to be in the same library.  We're treated to an endless series of "Aha!" moments from them where they pounce on what they believe to have been the central issue, only to be totally wrong.</span>

<br />
<span>For the record, no one objected to Bill Clinton because he didn't go to Vietnam.  Most of the country, after all, didn't go to Vietnam.  That wasn't the point.  Had he used legitimate, legal methods to keep from going to war, no one would have thought twice about it.  The point is, was, and always will be that he DIDN'T use legitimate methods.  THAT is what made him a draft dodger, not just the fact that he didn't go.</span>
<br />
<span></span>
<br />
<span>Fast forward to 2004, where the Democrats have triumphantly nominated a Vietnam veteran and called everyone else in the nation who didn't set foot in Vietnam a draft dodger, regardless of how or why they stayed home.  Point missed.</span>
