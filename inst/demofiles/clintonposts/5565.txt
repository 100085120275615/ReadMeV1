Since I packed up all my nightstand books for the move awhile ago, I've been without anything to read for too long. And of course, I need one more thing to keep me from writing! So we went to the bookstore the other day and I bought the following:<br /><br />1.<a href="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0060878835.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V54590358_.jpg"><img src="http://ec1.images-amazon.com/images/P/0060878835.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V54590358_.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060878835/sr=8-1/qid=1154964673/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-5374097-6835162?ie=UTF8">Queen of the Oddballs</a> by Hillary Carlip<br /><br />A very fun and easy read (I'm already finished), it's the Hollywood memoir of a comedy writer/performer/jill-of-all-trades and has lots of good pop culture tidbits and pictures. This woman met and befriended Carly Simon, won a Gong Show contest, and appeared in Xanadu, what more could you ask for?<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />2.<a href="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1416503854.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_V60832810_.jpg"><img src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1416503854.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_V60832810_.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416503854/sr=1-1/qid=1154964919/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-5374097-6835162?ie=UTF8&s=books">Why Moms Are Weird</a> - by <a href="http://www.pamie.com">Pamela Ribon</a><br /><br /><br />I started reading Pamie's blog 5 or 6 years ago, another comedy writer who is damn funny. She wrote another book (Why Girls are Weird) that was good and I'm expecting the same here. I'm drawn to witty women, particularly when I'm feeling my most cynical and in need of some levity - like now. Although I mainly read non-fiction, I've been jonesing for some escape. Also with fiction, I like to go with a known quantity - I hate when fiction disappoints and I'm picky enough that it often does. Hell, I think I'm the only person who hates Barbara Kingsolver after only reading 1 chapter because she wrote in present tense. Who does that?<br /><br /><br />3. <a href="http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/0060592885.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg"><img src="http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/0060592885.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIsitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,45,-64_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060592885/sr=1-1/qid=1154965548/ref=sr_1_1/104-5374097-6835162?ie=UTF8&s=books">I'm no one you know</a> - by Joyce Carol Oates<br /><br />Well, ok, so I had to balance out the funny with the angst. I've read several of her short stories and would like to get a better feel for her writing so this collection of short stories should do the trick, particularly when the review says something like: <span>her new searing short stories explore the malevolent aspects of human sexuality with unflinching authenticity and a cathartic fascination</span>. I say, bring on the cathartic fascination and malevolent sex!<br /><br /><br /><br />4. <a href="http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/037570129X.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIlitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,32,-59_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_.gif"><img src="http://ec3.images-amazon.com/images/P/037570129X.01._BO2,204,203,200_PIlitb-dp-500-arrow,TopRight,32,-59_AA240_SH20_SCLZZZZZZZ_.gif" border="0" alt="" /></a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/037570129X/sr=1-1/qid=1154965821/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-5374097-6835162?ie=UTF8&s=books">Autobiography of Red</a> - by Anne Carson<br /><br />As per our previous conversation re: poetry (see a few entries ago), I decided to check this out. Why are all the angsty women named Carson? (With the exception of a certain <a href="http://viviandarkbloom.tripod.com/hair.htm">insatiable hair consultant</a> of course).<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />5. The July/Aug issue of <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200607">Atlantic Monthly</a><br /><br />I waded through most of this yesterday. I had a subscription for many years, but the guilt of not wanting/being able to get through every issue eventually made me give it up; also the news was depressing and I couldn't deal with any more stories about war and Bush and the state of the union. Although that's still the case, I wanted a magazine I could flip through and read or not read whatever. I have one story left marked that I plan to read and hey, V, you would enjoy it: <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200607/florence-murder">The Monster of Florence</a> about a serial killer who preyed on couples making love up in the hills around Florence, IT. Right up your alley! I'm a sucker for true crime and it sounds like this has a bunch of sordid details and sketchy Italian political mechinations going on.<br /><br />That be it. I need to get out and mow the parts of the grass that aren't dead from the heat and pack up shit in the garage. It's only 85 right now so I'd better get out there - we're supposed to have storms this afternoon so that's cool (they all passed by us last night - did you see the moon? It was pretty incredible and nearing full).
