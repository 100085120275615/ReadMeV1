<div>First, a quote from so-called "victims' rights" advocate Marc Klaas, discussing John Mark Karr, the man who claims to have been present when JonBenet Ramsey was killed, though none of his claims are adding up (and he now looks to be little more than a man trying to grab a slice of celebrity):<br />
<br />"...[Karr] [reportedly] obsesses about little dead girls, and he was arrested in [one of] the [largest] child-sex-trafficking destinations on the face of the globe, [Thailand]. Whether he had anything to do with JonBenet's murder or not, I think it's very important he be put away for a very, very long time."<br />
<br />Not that I don't find <em>everything</em> about the Ramsey case perverse, but am I to understand, now, that a) having a perverse obsession, and b) traveling to Thailand, is enough to have you "put away [in prison] for a very, very long time"?  <br />
<br />So: <em>that</em> is why so-called "victims' rights" self-promoters like Wendy Murphy and Marc Klaas are among the most dangerous hucksters in the country.  <br />
<br />And lest you think the above quote from Klaas is indicative of Klaas' belief that Karr <em>did</em> in fact kill Ramsey, check <em>this</em> Klaas quote out, from the same interview:<br />
<br />"There's more evidence suggesting this guy didn't do it than there is suggesting he did do it."<br />
<br />It's quite the statement about a person, when their views about the American criminal justice system are so extreme that, by law, they <em>could never be seated on any jury anywhere in the United States</em>.  To me, that's one prerequisite for me listening to your views on the criminal justice system: you have to have views sufficiently in line with the Constitution to enable you to sit on a jury.  What despicable liars like Murphy, Klaas, and Nancy Grace have in common is that <em>none</em> of them, consistent with their own professions of belief, would be qualified to sit on a jury.  <br />
<br />Any jury, on any charge, anywhere in the United States or its territories.<br />
<br />As well to have an anarchist holding forth on the mid-term elections!  Or a Christian Scientist discoursing on the best medical treatments for the common cold!  It is <em>shocking</em>, even <em>horrifying</em>, how little many Americans know about one of their three civic duties--serving on a jury (the others: paying taxes and, hypothetically, being susceptible to the draft)--and the <em>clear</em> reason for this ignorance is <em>television</em>.  Radicals like Marc Klaas, whose views have no valid place in American discourse on the law--or, no more a valid place than the Unabomber's on law enforcement--are given legitimacy by corporate behemoths like MSNBC and CNN, such that Americans think it's consistent with being a red-blooded American to convict a man based on his hobbies and travel plans.<br />
<br />Next, there's Eleanor Clift, discussing how the Republicans will use the specter of Osama bin Laden to win November's mid-term elections:<br />
<br />"A Republican Senate hopeful in New York is already linking Hillary Clinton to Osama in a television ad that attacks Clinton for voting against the Patriot Act and speaking out against the administration's unauthorized wiretapping."<br />
<br />Amazing.  The fact that the Bush Administration has done <em>nothing</em> to catch the man who master-minded September 11th--over the last five years--is somehow a feather in their cap?  What a world.  What's more amazing is that, if Clift's prediction is accurate, and if the Senate race in New York is any indication, the explanation for why Bush <em>couldn't</em> deliver the man who killed 2,700 Americans in 2001 will be a) we couldn't tap his phone all those times he personally called the U.S. since September 11th, and b) the Patriot Act, which operates only domestically, would have been stronger without Democrats in office, and might have caught bin Laden all those times he visited the U.S. since 2001.  <br />
<br />It's an argument which falls apart, I suppose, if bin Laden <em>hasn't</em> been vacationing in Boca Raton recently, and if he <em>hasn't</em> made a habit of using his Sidekick to drunk-dial Americans here on American soil.  <br />
<br />I think it's the <em>Democrats</em> who should be playing the Osama bin Laden card, as in: where is he?  And does the fact that 200,000 U.S. soldiers can't find him on their own suggest that maybe we need better intelligence and law enforcement resources on the case, as opposed to more "boots on the ground"?  Does it perhaps suggest, also, that Iraq is a major distraction in the war on terror?<br />
<br />More lies from our President, discussing the recent federal court decision holding his domestic wire-tapping scheme unconstitutional:<br />
<br />"If al-Qaida is calling in to the United States, we want to know why they're calling."<br />
<br />Fantastic!  Unfortunately that little observation has absolutely <em>nothing</em> to do with the President's domestic wire-tapping scheme, which was and is so virulently unconstitutional that issue-spotting the many ways in which this despicable little decree violates our civil liberties and founding documents should be a prerequisite for entering law school--instead of the LSAT.  <br />
<br />Bush's ongoing attempt to deceive Americans regarding his wire-tapping program goes something like this: we can presently listen to al-Qaida communications whenever we want--provided we have "probable cause," which means sufficient cause to make any reasonable person believe doing so would elucidate any aspect of a criminal plot--yet the President's self-appointed task is to convince Americans that unless we can wire-tap al-Qaida calls <em>without</em> probable cause, we can't tap them at all.  <br />
<br />In legal circles, that sort of representation would constitute a <em>misrepresentation</em>--or, more colloquially, a lie.  Good thing the leader of the free world has less integrity than the average lawyer.</div>
