<div>I also realized that lines on the face are good if youâre an actor. Sometimes lines can add character where there is none. A squint can be elevated from a mere actorly gesture into an acting choice. <br />
<br />Take Clint Eastwood for example. In <u>Million Dollar Baby</u> he and Morgan Freeman just had to stand there, look impassively and say nothing to earn an Oscar nomination; meanwhile poor Hillary Swank had to spend months in strenuous training and preparation to earn accolades for her acting. They just relied on their lines; she had to memorize hers.<br />
<br />Sometimes a few lines on the face may convey more meaning than a dozen on page. So I should just stop right now and frown. Or smile. Or squint.<br />
<br />You may raise your eyebrows now.</div>
