<br />FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:<br />
<br />CLINTON MEETS WITH ANTI-WAR CANDIDATE FROM CT, BUT REFUSES TO DEBATE WAR IN NY.<br />
<br />NEW YORK, NY - Today Sen. Clinton is meeting with Ned Lamont, the anti-war Democratic challenger from Connecticut at the same time she continues to refuse to discuss the war with her own primary challenger, Jonathan Tasini.<br />
<br />âWhy is Senator Clinton apparently willing to discuss issues with anti-war candidates from other states, but isnât willing to do so publicly with her own New York Democratic primary challenger,â said Tasini.<br />
<br />âIs she afraid to let voters know where she actually stands on the issues?âThe Marist poll released yesterday found that only ten percent of Democrats in New York say they will vote for a pro-war candidate whereas 64 percent (up from 62 percent from the last Marist poll in July) say they would vote an anti-war candidate.<br />

<br />âI believe that this war is illegal and immoral and that we should bring home our troops immediately.â<br />
