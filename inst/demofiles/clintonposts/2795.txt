<div><p>That seems to be what Erick over that the great <a href="http://www.redstate.com/stories/elections/2006/wapo_to_gop_you_are_doomed_part_iii">RedState.com</a> is hinting at with this story.</p>

<p>Not sure I'm with him yet, but I would not be terribly suprised, sadly.  The Post is a two-faced newspaper.  On the one hand, they do excellent reporting and aren't as looney all the time (for instantce, the absolutly <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/17/AR2006081701541.html">SLAM</a> France today) but they also hold a very fixed political position and it can bleed over into their reporting.  The recent front and back page haymakers they have thrown at Allen day after day are proof that the Post has certain figures they just don't like.  I don't recall this wall to wall coverage for Hillary Clinton's crack about Ghandi working in a gas station.  </p>

<p>So it would not suprise me for Jim VandeHei to cut corners to prove a political point.</p></div>
