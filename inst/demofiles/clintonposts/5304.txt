Ha. Â Hillary "Wal-Mart Board" Clinton is an anti-Wal-Mart guerrilla? Â Joe 
Biden, the Senator from Citibank, wielding an RPG?
<p>
Hezbollah:
<ul>
<li>Has an actual popular movement base
<li>Delivers some fraction of the proverbial goods to that base
<li>Can fight
<li>Is willing to tangle with Israel
</ul>
If Democrats actually resembled Hezbollah, you might be able to vote again.

Thanks for your blog. Â It's welcome reading from the confines of Beltway 
Democratic-support organizations.
