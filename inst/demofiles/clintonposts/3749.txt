<div>When did Americans become <strong>entitled</strong> to <em>cradle-to-grave</em> care by our government? This phenomenon - blaming the current presidential administration for everything that goes wrong in American's lives - is relatively new. In fact, it is new and exclusive to President George W. Bush.<br />
<br />Currently we're witnessing more <strong>entitlement whining</strong> from Americans than ever before. Why?<br />
<br />
<strong>Politics.</strong> And the <strong>Main Stream Media</strong>. The actual events of the day are not going to be reported if the MSM is at odds with the "news" philosophically. The MSM will "report" what they wish happened, what they want to happen, what they hope will happen, all in the hope that they will <strong>change the course of events</strong>.<br />
<br />So why the whining and absurd expectations coming from Hurrican Katrina victims and now, Americans in Lebanon?<br />
<br />
<strong>Some history:</strong>
<br />Statistically, there was more damage from flooding during the Clinton administration than during the first Bush administration, and the number of disaster declarations under Clinton was higher. After removing damage and precipitation effects, the researchers found that Clinton's declaration numbers were about the same as Bush's.<br />
<br />Yet, Americans were not barraged with negative media about the Clinton administration's failure to <strong>save</strong> each and every victim of flooding, hurricane, tornado oe earthquake.<br />
<br />
<strong>This was hushed-up:</strong>
<br />FORGOTTEN NATIONAL TRAGEDY: BILL CLINTON AND 1,000 DEATHS IN THE "CHICAGO HEAT WAVE" OF 1995<a name="112616395384452321"> </a>
<br />Hillary Clinton has called for a "Katrina Commission." How come she never called for a commission to investigate why at least <a href="http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/pr96/apr96/noaa96-21.html">1,000 Americans died</a> in a 1995 heat wave when her husband was president?The "Chicago heat wave" killed more people than Hurricane Andrew, TWA Flight 800, the Oklahoma City bombing and the Northridge, CA earthquake, combined.<br />
<br />Curiously, Hillary Clinton did not point out what her husband and administration did to prevent widespread suffering as a result of the massive heat wave that struck the Midwest in 1995 and was particularly devastating to the city of Chicago.<br />For one terrible week in July 1995, daytime temperatures in Chicago soared above 100 degrees; even at night the mercury barely dipped below that. Public-health officials knew the prolonged heat would be deadly, especially for frail seniors, but they were stunned by the final death toll. Altogether, the heat wave killed more than 700 Chicagoans, more than double the number who died in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. As New York University sociologist Eric Klinenberg writes in Heat Wave, his remarkable book about the tragedy, "The proportional death toll ... in Chicago has no equal in the record of U.S. heat disasters."

<br />Hillary hopes, that with the help of the MSM, Americans have short memories.<br />
<br />
<strong>On disasters</strong>:<br />Guidelines governing the president's decision include consideration of a state's ability to respond, but these guidelines are vague, leaving the process open to influence from media coverage, cronyism, and political pressure.

<br />listed by:<br />
<span>President, Fiscal Years, Number Disaster, Declarations, Counties Included, Damage (millions 1995 dollars)<br />

<br />Although the differences among presidents do not follow political party lines, they do correspond to some general policy orientations. President Reagan's small number of PDDs is consistent with his stated goal of reducing the role of the federal government and returning responsibilities to the states. In contrast, President Clinton put a priority on federal disaster response, expanding the role of FEMA and the prominence of its director.<br />
<br />The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake occured on October 18, 1989 in the Santa Cruz Mountains of Central California.<br />Depth: 16.79 km<br />Magnitude: 6.9 Mw, 7.1 Ms, 6.7 Ml<br />Faulting:This earthquake was the first major event to occur along the San Andreas fault zone since the <a href="http://seismo.berkeley.edu/faq/1906_0.html">1906</a> earthquake. The Loma Prieta earthquake ruptured the southernmost 40 km of the 1906 break, in comparable amounts of right-lateral strike slip and reverse slip motion. Deaths: 63<br />Injuries: 3,757<br />Property Damage: $ 5,900,000,000. At the time, this was the most costly natural disaster in the United States.<br />
<br />Californians at the time of that earthquake, did not demand that the state or Federal government save them. George H. W. Bush was President. He <em>was not</em> universally hated by the media.<br />
<br />The Northridge Earthquake, which struck at 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17, 1994, killed 72 people, injured 11,846 and caused more than $12.5 billion in damages, making it one of the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history.<br />
<br />Again, no demand for government entitlements by victims of the quake. Bill Clinton was President and was the darling of the MSM.<br />
<br />So, what's happening now? The <strong>
<em>main stream media</em>
</strong> hates President Bush with such passion and conviction that regardless of how ridiculous it sounds, they <strong>blame him and his administration for every disaster</strong>.<br />
<br />One example is "Journalist" <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/paulkrugman/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More Articles by Paul Krugman">PAUL KRUGMAN</a> in a September 5, 2005 article in the New York Times:<br />
<br />"Each day since Katrina brings more evidence of the lethal ineptitude of federal officials. I'm not letting state and local officials off the hook, but federal officials had access to resources that could have made all the difference, but were never mobilized."<br />
<br />Another by Sasha Brown, in November 23, 2005:<br />
<br />"Although Hurricane Katrina was a "natural" disaster, there are lessons to be learned from some of the highly unnatural disasters that followed in its wake, a panel of experts told a crowd gathered in Kirsch Auditorium on Nov. 15.<br />Sponsored by the Program in Science, Technology and Society (STS), the talk was the fifth in a series of symposia asking the "Big Questions After Big Hurricanes." This symposium was titled, "What's So Natural About Natural Disasters?"<br />"America had expectations that the government would respond," said the Class of 1947 Career Development Associate Professor Meg Jacobs, one of the three speakers."<br />
<br />***<br />And instead of the incessant complaining about how slow the federal government was to respond, where were the reports of the long-standing government corruption of New Orleans and the subsequent failures of the local and state governments of Louisanna? <em>New York Daily News'</em> Errol Louis writes: "Louisiana and New Orleans have a long, well-known reputation for corruption: as former congressman Billy Tauzin once put it, "half of Louisiana is under water and the other half is under indictment."<br />That's putting it mildly. Adjusted for population size, the state ranks third in the number of elected officials convicted of crimes (Mississippi is No. 1). Recent scandals include the conviction of 14 state judges and an FBI raid on the business and personal files of a Louisiana congressman."<br />
<br />he continues...<br />"In 1991, a notoriously corrupt Democrat named Edwin Edwards ran for governor against Republican David Duke, a former head of the Ku Klux Klan. Edwards, whose winning campaign included bumper stickers saying "Elect the Crook," is currently serving a 10-year prison sentence for taking bribes from casino owners. Duke recently completed his own prison term for tax fraud.<br />The rot included the New Orleans Police Department, which in the 1990s had the dubious distinction of being the nation's most corrupt police force and the least effective: the city had the highest murder rate in America. More than 50 officers were eventually convicted of crimes including murder, rape and robbery; two are currently on Death Row."<br />
<br />Every American adult over the age of 35 remembers the news stories and knows that New Orleans officials are notorious for their corruption.<br />
<br />As Cybercast News Service <a href="http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=/Nation/Archive/200509/NAT20050907a.html" target="_blank">previously reported</a>, state lawmakers and the Orleans Levee Board engaged in an ongoing battle between 1996 and 2001 over how the board spent money. Residents of the levee district also defeated a tax increase proposed by the board. New Orleans City Councilwoman and former Orleans Levee Board Member Peggy Wilson recalled those battles. "Nobody was convinced that [the levee board] needed any more money and, of course, they didn't," Wilson charged. Instead of spending money on levee maintenance and improvements, the levee board focused on widening bridges and making other accommodations for riverboat casinos, she said. The casinos are a major source of the levee board's funding since they pay for use of the riverfront property adjacent to their "boats."<br />
<br />***<br />And now we are being subjected to the incessant whining by Americans in Lebanon about The U.S.'s slow evacuation from Lebanon. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi released this statement: "The United States government has an obligation to get thousands of its citizens out of harm's way in Lebanon quickly and safely. That means making it clear to the combatants that we will not tolerate any interference with our evacuation activities."<br />
<br />The United States has an obligation to "rescue" people who voluntarily traveled to Lebanon, moved there or attend University? These people are not hostages. And they are not naive. The American-born U.S. citizens who traveled or moved to Lebanon did so to make a political statement. But now they want out?<br />
<br />Read what the MSM talking heads and political opportunists are saying about the evacuation process:<br />
<br />JACK CAFFERTY: Remember Katrina? France has gotten more than 700 of their people out!<br />
<br />CHRIS JANSING: Sort of brought back, you know, the whole Katrina thing.<br />
<br />ANDERSON COOPER: It's like Katrina all over again.<br />
<br />NANCY PELOSI: Just another manifestation of the Katrina mentality.<br />
<br />HARRY REID: It is too bad that this is being treated as a mini Katrina.<br />
<br />ANDREA KOPPEL: The slow response that the Bush administration had after Katrina...<br />
<br />MILES O'BRIEN: One of the people we talked to earlier today equated it to...Katrina!<br />
<br />KATE SNOW: Some in Capitol Hill are bringing up memories of Hurricane Katrina.<br />
<br />DAVID SHUSTER: The image of Americans terrified has burned the Bush administration before following Hurricane Katrina.<br />
<br />PAULA ZAHN: You have heard Katrina, calling it "a mini-Katrina."<br />
<br />
<em>...there's not an original thought in the bunch. Did they get their talking points off the DNC website? From Howard Dean's mouth directly to you via the MSM...</em>
<br />
<br />and <a href="http://newsbusters.org/node/6481" target="new">(NB: Looking for Something to Kvetch About, MSM Settles for 'Slow Evacuation')</a>
<br />
<br />It's no longer NEWS reporting: "The news, you have to look at it the same way you look at any retail product on the shelf at your favorite store. It's product. It's packaged. It's assembled. It's marketed. The news today is not what happened. The news today is what reporters want to happen. The news today is propaganda. The news today is agenda-oriented."(<em>Rush Limbaugh</em>)<br />
<br />So I ask... what are so many Americans doing in Lebanon?<br />

<br />"One thing is lost in all the press coverage of the whining Americans who went to Lebanon of their own accord and now want us to pick up the tab to get them out.<br />THE MAJORITY OF AMERICANS IN LEBANON ARE HEZBOLLAH SUPPORTERS.<br />Most of them are Shiite Muslims, many of whom hold dual U.S. and Lebanese citizenship. Many are anchor babies born here to Muslims in the U.S. illegally. Some are illegal aliens who became citizens through rubber-stamping Citizenship and Immigration Services (and its INS predecessor) coupled with political pressure by spineless politicians.<br />Of the 25,000 American citizens and green-card holders in Lebanon, at least 7,000 are from Dearborn, Michigan, the heart of Islamic America, and especially Shia Islam. These 7,000 are mostly Shi'ite Muslims who openly and strongly support Hezbollah. Ditto for many of the rest of the 25,000 that are there.

<br />
<br />And these people have the audacity to whine about the conditions of their <em>rescue</em> from a country they <strong>chose to live in and/or travel to</strong>, that is now at war.<br />
<br />The entitlement mentality spreading across our country is a shameful creation of the political left and MSM. <em>Big Government will take care of you. You</em> deserve <em>to be taken care of</em>.<br />
<br />As long as it's not George Bush doing the caring. Regardless of what he and his administration does to keep America safe, the irrational hatred of him by the elite leftie media will only fuel their means-to-an-end lying, falsifying, perjurous behavior; and, continue to perpetuate the entitlement mentality of America's sheeples.</div>
