<p>I saw this list, and I HAD to repost it.</p>
<p>(Full credit for this list goes out to Neal Boortz, Syndicated AM Talk Show host)</p>
<p><strong>Why you shouldn&#8217;t vote Republican</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They have absolutely no fiscal discipline whatsoever. No congress has ever blown money on vote-buying programs quite like the current Republican congress has.
</li>
<li>There are far too many Republicans who want to take their personal religious blueprints for behavior and make them law.</li>
<li>The seem unwilling to press the advantage when it is theirs to press.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re prudes.</li>
<li>Stem cell research.</li>
<li>Donald Wildmon</li>
<li>The McCain-Feingold Campaign Reform Act.</li>
<li>Democrats think that it&#8217;s odd that the jails are so full while our crime rate is going down.</li>
<li>The Medicare Prescription Drug benefit for the Gimme Generation</li>
<li>If they had their way, Terri Schiavo&#8217;s soul would still not be at rest.</li>
<li>They pay more attention to K Street than they do to the American workers and businessmen carrying the load.</li>
<li>They can&#8217;t even protect America&#8217;s borders.</li>
<li>Do you want your kids to come home from a government school and tell you that the Earth is only 6000 years old?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why you shouldn&#8217;t vote Democrat</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They clearly will not defend America from Islamic Fascism &#8230; not now &#8230; not until the price of that defense is catastrophic.</li>
<li>They think terrorism is a law enforcement problem.</li>
<li>Their war against individualism.</li>
<li>They think America is great because of its government.</li>
<li>They seem to think that income is distributed, not earned.</li>
<li>They promote class warfare.</li>
<li>They have almost single-handedly destroyed black culture in America.</li>
<li>Hillary Clinton.</li>
<li>They&#8217;re joined at the hip with teacher&#8217;s unions.</li>
<li>Taxes can never be too high for Democrats.</li>
<li>They fully intend to destroy talk radio.</li>
<li>Their love of mob rule.</li>
<li>The fully intend to turn illegal aliens into Democrat voters.</li>
<li>Like the Republicans; they refuse to protect America&#8217;s borders</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why your shouldn&#8217;t vote Libertarian</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>With over 50% of the American people harboring strong libertarian feelings, they can&#8217;t manage to mount a viable third-party campaign.  How would they manage to govern?</li>
<li>Not only will they not defend America&#8217;s borders, they don&#8217;t really think the borders need defending.</li>
<li>Though philosophically they&#8217;re right, they fail to see that their &#8220;legalize drugs&#8221; agenda isn&#8217;t exactly a winner with the American people.</li>
<li>They never jumped on eminent domain abuse as the party agenda.  People will react when they think their property rights are being threatened &#8230;. and the Libertarians couldn&#8217;t take advantage of this.</li>
<li>Have you seen the way some of the people at their convention dress?</li>
</ul>
