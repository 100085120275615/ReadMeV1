An old friend of mine is outraged by the deviousness (and I'm sure he would say the deviance) of the Far Left. I don't know about deviance, but a certain amount of cyber-treachery is involved in his latest discovery.<br /><br /><strong>Try this</strong>: Go to <a href="http://www.google.com">Google</a> and type the word "failure" in the search box. Hit Enter. See what comes up.<br /><br />Is the result a political bias on the part of the people at Google, where the corporate motto is "Don't be evil"? Nope.<br /><br />But political bias and a low form of evil are involved. It's called "google-bombing" and it involves a deliberate guerilla effort by anonymous and "determined" Bush-haters to wage a dirty-tricks insurgency of their own. Is it fair and legal? Sure. Is it malicious? Sure. Will conservative operatives pick it up? Sure. But it shows exactly the lengths to which the disloyal opposition will go to stain the other side (<em>expect to see some form of this regarding Hillary</em>.) We don't need foreign wars ... we're too busy trying to annihilate ourselves.<br /><br />Here's <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/googlebombing-failure.html">Google's official explanation</a> posted last year:<br /><br /><a name="112690048674935931"><strong><span>Googlebombing 'failure'</span></strong></a><br /><em>9/16/2005 12:54:00 PM</em><br /><em></em>Posted by Marissa Mayer, Director of Consumer Web Products<br /><br />If you do a Google search on the word [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=failure">failure</a>] or the phrase [<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=miserable+failure">miserable failure</a>], the top result is currently the White Houseâs official biographical page for President Bush. We've received some complaints recently from users who assume that this reflects a political bias on our part. I'd like to explain how these results come up in order to allay these concerns.<br /><br />Google's search results are generated by computer programs that rank web pages in large part by examining the number and relative popularity of the sites that link to them. By using a practice called <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;c2coff=1&q=googlebombing&amp;btnG=Search">googlebombing</a>, however, determined pranksters can occasionally produce odd results. In this case, a number of webmasters use the phrases [failure] and [miserable failure] to describe and link to President Bush's website, thus pushing it to the top of searches for those phrases.<br /><br />We don't condone the practice of googlebombing, or any other action that seeks to affect the integrity of our search results, but we're also reluctant to alter our results by hand in order to prevent such items from showing up. Pranks like this may be distracting to some, but they don't affect the overall quality of our search service, whose objectivity, as always, remains the core of our mission.
