<p>Let's all rally around the political class.&nbsp; There is a HUGE scandal at Fannie Mae, yet the good ol' boy/girl network that is the DC establishment has won out.&nbsp; The financial statements at Fannie Mae were plainly manipulated by the management in cahoots with the senior financial officers to maintain the huge financial bonuses they gave themselves.&nbsp; The management at Fannie Mae was littered with ex-Clintonites.</p><p>After an investigation, the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/business/20060824-124204-3786r.htm">Washington Times reports </a>that the investigation has been closed:</p><blockquote><p>Fannie Mae, the government-sponsored mortgage lending giant, won't face criminal charges over its multibillion-dollar accounting irregularities, the U.S. attorney's office said today after two years of investigation. </p><p>...One knowledgeable Justice official said today that it was not expected that any individuals would be charged. This individual requested anonymity because, while the investigation of the company has been closed, the overall investigation has not been officially closed.</p></blockquote><p>This is a major scandal because at any regulated public company, the&nbsp; executives would be charged with fraud, misuse of company funds and would be fighting criminal prosecution.&nbsp; However, this is Fannie Mae.&nbsp; Fannie Mae has given huge amounts of &quot;support&quot; to government candidates and therefore can count on lots of pressure on government officials to quash the serious stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp; No one from either party wants to turn off the spigot, so the investigation is closed...&nbsp; however if there is a large hue and cry by the populace, you will note that the government will leave the investigative door open just a touch.</p><p>This is my part of the HUE AND CRY.&nbsp; I think that it is appropriate to write your congressman and Senators a little note about this.&nbsp; Franklin Raines, the ex-CEO and his cohorts including Jamie Gorelick of the 9/11 commision fame should be hung up by their fingernails.&nbsp; What gives them a pass, when the public companies of the nation are sweating bullets and hemmoraging billions of dollars in fees to comply with the burdens of Sarbanes-Oxley?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
