<p>I can&#8217;t believe that I&#8217;ve been blogging for almost 5 years now.Â  I had a great deal to say about 9-11, about &#8220;The War,&#8221; about the elections and about Iraq.</p>
<p>So frickin&#8217; what?</p>
<p>Why is it that in the real world I have friends of all political and religious persuasions, but in politics all I hear is shouting?Â  Who will the next Democratic nomination go to?Â  Hillary Clinton?Â  Fine.Â  And the republican nominaton?Â  John McCain? Fine.</p>
<p>Can we focus on the issues now?Â  OK?</p>
<p>Iraq: We are staying there until we win. Dems know it.Â  GOP knows it.</p>
<p>Iran: Can&#8217;t be allowed to have the bomb.Â  Is being allowed to have the bomb.</p>
<p>EU: Whatever.</p>
<p>Education: Everybody needs to learn reading, math and history.Â  Everyone living in America ought to have access to an outstanding education that prepares them to live a life they love.</p>
<p>Health Care: Everybody needs to be healthy.<br />
Crime : Criminals should be caught and punished.</p>
<p>Can&#8217;t we do that?Â  We can do that.Â  Let&#8217;s do that!
