Why do you always lick the tips of your fingers after eating potato chips?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
I tried to lick other people&#039;s fingers, but some considered that &#034;rude.&#034;</p>

What is the dumbest question you have ever been asked by an arrestee?</p>

After locking up a guy for DUI at 4am, he asked, &#034;Hey, can you call my boss and tell him I&#039;ll be out sick today?&#034;</p>

What is the dumbest crime you have ever investigated?</p>

Quadruple murder.  No, I would say it had to be The Great TastyKake Theft.  A store manager caught a kid stealing two TastyKakes â a Philly delicacy â and captured it on the store&#039;s video camera.  The manager wanted me to drop everything and get a warrant for this kid.  Total value stolen: $2.00.</p>

Sometimes doing the right thing is tough.  Sometimes we have to choose between bad and worse.  You are in a tough business.  I have known snipers that get bothered even though what they did was absolutely right.  It seems being a cop would have some similar circumstances.  Did you ever lose any sleep over the choices you had to make at work? </p>

Crime never sleeps!  The worst incident I can recall occurred about ten years ago.  A 6&#039;2&#034;, 300-pound man was running in and out of traffic, high on PCP and crack.  I arrived with my backup, an older female, who tried to talk to the guy.  He started taking off his clothes and said, &#034;I am Jesus Christ!&#034;  The next thing I know, he tries to grab my backup&#039;s pistol.  I rear back with my nightstick and hit him across his chest as hard as I could.  The man looked at me and laughed.  I immediately called for an Assist Officer, and it took seven of us to get him in the wagon.  For the next few days, I was waiting for the call that the guy died.  Not from the drugs, but from my Babe Ruth impersonation.  I was scared to death.  IAB cleared me, and it was a necessary action, but I still had doubts.</p>

<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Of course, not.  Guns don&#039;t kill people; dangerous minorities do.</p>

Hey copper, Ooops I mean Detective, Do you ever get any sun on those legs of yours or do you use them to light your way at night?</p>

When the Mother Ship lands, who do you think they&#039;ll avoid killing: the bronzed, cancer-ridden surfers, or the pale, alien-looking misfits?  I stand by my decision.</p>

<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
None.  I don&#039;t like bloggers.  Kidding!  I already knew Deathlok from Temerity of High Maintenance and Grimjack from Grim Musings, and I recently met Ssssteve from First With Flair and Fitch from Radioactive Liberty.</p>

Not a one.  Kidding again!  All four are top-notch people.  There is a laundry list of others who I would like to meet.</p>

This may seem like bull, but I&#039;m not much of a gun guy.  I love my city-issued Glock 17 because it&#039;s idiot proof.  A good idea, since Philadelphia hires so many idiot cops.  Hell, they hired me!  My father-in-law gave me his Smith &#038; Wesson .38 snub-nose revolver for my birthday a few years back.  That&#039;s nice and small, but packs a punch.  As for my third, my friend has an AR-15 assault rifle that is a dream to shoot.  Little kick, and a comfortable weapon to hold.</p>

<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Because the fat ones won&#039;t fit in my template.  Heh.</p>

You told us who Kyle likes, which cartoon characters are your favorites?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
I would say my top three â in order of importance â are Daffy Duck, Stewie Griffin, and Howard Dean.</p>

After watching the &#034;candidates&#034; visit the Iowa State Fair, I have one question of great political importance.  Which is worse, eating a deep-fried twinkie or getting a sweaty hug from Joe Biden?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Oh, thanks a lot, that&#039;s a fair choice!  I would probably go with the one without all the fat, artificial coloring, and flavoring that won&#039;t rot my insides: the deep-fried Twinkie.</p>
<p><img src="http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f75/basilsblog/cigargirlio7.jpg" alt="camarks" border="0" width="186" height="240" /><br />
Did you prefer the movie &#034;Wyatt Earp&#034; or &#034;Tombstone&#034;</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
I prefer Fahrenheit 9/11.  God, I don&#039;t believe I actually wrote that.  &#034;Wyatt Earp&#034; was which of the following: 1. Too long, 2. Too boring, 3. Had Kevin Costner, or 4. All of the above.  The correct answer is 4, so &#034;Tombstone&#034; gets the nod.</p>
<p><img src="http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f75/basilsblog/cigargirlio7.jpg" alt="camarks" border="0" width="186" height="240" /><br />
Are you really a sharp shooter? If so, how did you become one? Military? Or are you a for real law man? Never mind, I see on your profile that you are a police detective (very sexy). But is it really all that sexy of work? I wouldn&#039;t think so. It&#039;s a wholenother breed of man (or woman) to do that kind of work.</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
I&#039;m sorry, but I don&#039;t remember anything past the &#034;very sexy&#034; comment.  At the Police Academy, everyone shot a &#034;Badge Course&#034; â a contest where high scores earned a Police Badge (almost like a commendation).  From lowest to highest, the badges read &#034;Sharpshooter,&#034; &#034;Expert,&#034; &#034;Distinguished,&#034; and &#034;Distinguished 100&#034; (a perfect score).  I shot &#034;Expert,&#034; and missed &#034;Distinguished&#034; by two points, but Sharpshooter sounds better.   I was never in the military, but I am a real PPD Detective.  It is not exactly filled with the glamour NYPD Blue or Law &#038; Order make it out to be, but it&#039;s the best job in the department.</p>

That&#039;s the guy I send over to the homes of rude commenters.  Actually, it was a picture and a quote from the film &#034;Snatch.&#034;   It&#039;s one of my favorite movies.  I usually post some pic in the sidebar to distract readers from my lousy writing.</p>

<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Since Al Gore invented the internet.  It varies, because I started my first blog in late 2004, before jackass trolls made me shut it down in January, 2005.  I started SYLG on June 6, 2005, and have been boring readers ever since.</p>
<p><img src="http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f75/basilsblog/cigargirlio7.jpg" alt="camarks" border="0" width="186" height="240" /><br />
What do you hate to see on others&#039; blogs? This can mean content, images, or whatever.</p>

A lack of fabulous babes!   The last thing I want to be is the Blog Police.  Many blogs are personal, and include the blogger&#039;s personality, likes and dislikes, what have you.  Thus, I won&#039;t rip a blog because of something I find objectionable.  Having said (or wrote) that, if I personally visit a blog that has a ridiculous amount of four-letter words, pornography, or simply a lack of entertainment value, I won&#039;t come back.  And, for the record, I don&#039;t tolerate F-bombs or their equivalents on SYLG.</p>

What do you like to see blogged about? In other words, what topic will most likely cause you to comment on someone else&#039;s blog?</p>

I like people to write about my fine, upstanding blog!  Okay, that felt dirty.  To answer your question, I like almost anything: politics, sports, current events, pop culture; anything that is fairly topical, and (most of all) entertaining.  As far as comment motivation goes, I try to comment on every blog in my sidebar at least once a week.  That gets more and more difficult each day, but I also like to surf the blogosphere to find something worthwhile.  And, if I see a new commenter on SYLG, they always get a &#034;Welcome!&#034; and a reciprocal visit from me.  I don&#039;t like to comment for the sake of commenting, but if I have an opinion, you&#039;ll hear it.</p>

As a Tom Clancy reader myself, which of his books to favor and why?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
The one with Ben Affleck in it.  I&#039;m kidding.  Ben Affleck is a no-talent clod.  Red Storm Rising and Patriot Games are probably my favorites.  Although, his work of late has really taken a downturn in my opinion.</p>
<p><img src="http://i45.photobucket.com/albums/f75/basilsblog/tinkerbell.gif" alt="" width="142" height="198" border="0" /><br />
As a detective how do you feel about Clancy&#039;s political opinions about the release of top secret information?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
I regard the opinions of celebrities with the same disdain the blogosphere takes mine.  Clancy is a writer.  Write, damn it!  And keep your political opinions to yourself. </p>

Did you find a decline in your blog readers after your post about Patsy Ramsey? BTW, I happen to agree with you on it.</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Yeah, my average daily readership dropped from 8 to 3.  I would by lying if I said I didn&#039;t check out my daily stats, but I didn&#039;t see a real fluctuation after the Ramsey post â although I wouldn&#039;t have blamed the readers if they were steamed.</p>

<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Because that prissy little bitch Xbox wouldn&#039;t return my calls!  I rarely drink, I don&#039;t smoke, and crystal meth is getting too expensive.  Thus, PS2 is my main source of stress relief.  Without it, I would have to take out my frustrations on the public . . . from a clock tower.</p>

When will we finally see the swiftness of Jack Bauer, the justice of Vic Mackey and the occassional hot smoking SLYG calendar girl brought to the mean streets of Philidelphia?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Insol, you magnificent bastard, you read my mind!  Unfortunately, the answer to your question is &#034;When pigs fly.&#034;  Thanks to Philadelphia&#039;s suspect hiring practices, the only Jack Bauer or Vic Mackey you&#039;ll see wearing a PPD uniform is during &#034;24: Philadelphia.&#034;  As far as the fabulous babes go, there are plenty of them in the Philadelphia area . . . and none of them will give me the time of day!</p>

So you&#039;re a police detective. Cool! Is it true what they say about Cops and Donuts?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Erroneous!  Erroneous!  Believe it or not, many Philly cops visit Dunkin Donuts because their coffee is out of this world.  And for the record, I have NEVER eaten a donut in uniform â simply because I don&#039;t want people perpetuating the stereotype.</p>

What kind of heat do you pack, and if you had your choice for something else, what would that be?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
I like Icy Hot Heat Packs, especially when my knees . . . Oh, sorry.  Philadelphia police officers carry the Glock 17 on duty, although a few old-timers still carry .38 revolvers.  If I could choose something else, it would be the Desert Eagle, and shotguns would be in every car.  Nothing scares a thug more than a shotgun.</p>

Great.  A racing fan.  You know they just drive fast and turn left, right?  Nah, I&#039;m pulling your chain.  I&#039;m a HUGE NASCAR fan, but I also watch the occasional F1 or Indy Car race.  And Danica Patrick doesn&#039;t hurt, either.</p>

What was the worst experience you ever had in Court that you are allowed to discuss?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
A few weeks ago, I was involved in a jury trial.  I was &#034;on call&#034; at the division until the jury was selected â as is procedure.  The ADA calls me at 11am and tells me the judge is gonna hold me in contempt unless I get there a.s.a.p., so I fly out the door and race down.  When I get to the courtroom, the gallery is full, and the judge â a knucklehead named DeFino â called me into his chambers.  He left the doors open, and began to yell, curse, and berate me for ten minutes.  I mean, how dare I follow procedure instead of appearing before His Highness?  After he was done yelling and cursing, he called my captain, who explained I did nothing wrong.  DeFino dismissed me and had me walk out to the courtroom, where the gallery and the jury were sitting.  The &#034;judge&#034; wanted to let everyone know I was incompetent, I guess.  Any hoo, they called me to the stand, and I read the signed confession (after Miranda) of an aggravated assault into the record.  The judge dismissed me after my testimony, but as I was leaving, said on the record in front of the jury, &#034;Remember what we talked about, Detective.  Don&#039;t make that mistake again!&#034;  I left and the next day I heard that the jury found the offender not guilty on all counts.  NOT GUILTY after a SIGNED CONFESSION was obtained???  No one can tell me the jury didn&#039;t clear this scumbag because Judge DeFino tainted my testimony.   No one.  And, by the way, all court cases are public record after the decision, so there&#039;s no impropriety here.</p>

Honestly, it&#039;s watching these jackass judges in action.  Whether it&#039;s coming two hours late or coming to ludicrous decisions, the Philadelphia Judicial System is a comedy unto itself.</p>

PC, but hopefully with something better than dial-up.  As of now, my blog is published on a computer that works on hamster power.</p>

Since I am actually related to Wyatt Earp and his brothers, I wondering if this guy was, in reality, related in any way to Wyatt Earp.  Or, is he simply using a pseudonym.</p>

I am not, but Wyatt Earp sounded better than by birth name: Biff Biffman.</p>

I got together for dinner with Sssteve from First With Flair and Fitch from Radioactive Liberty.  Sssteve came from Washington (not D.C.)  to Philly with his brother to buy a car.  Seriously.  They then drove it home, where it soon died in Sssteve&#039;s brother&#039;s arms.  I just laughed and laughed!</p>

Does that processed, jet-propelled crap in the can count?  If not, I&#039;d have to say Swiss.  Those yodeling, fondue-dipping, pacifists really know their stuff.</p>

What&#039;s the best part of your job?</p>

There&#039;s a &#034;best part?&#034;  Most new cops would say &#034;helping people.&#034;  Me?  Since most of the people in my detective division hate the police, I would say it&#039;s putting scumbags away for a long, long time.</p>

The worse?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
The pay, the hours, the current city administration.  Pretty much everything else.</p>

What would you be doing if you weren&#039;t a dectective?</p>

Probably sitting around all day, blogging in my underpants.  Oh wait: I do that now.  Well, I would have to say I&#039;d still be coaching high school lacrosse and busting my hump to get a writing job.  I&#039;d love to write a novel, but in all honesty, I&#039;m not that talented.</p>

What does blogging do for you?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Ask not what blogging can do for you.  Ask what you can do for blogging!  Writing has always been my outlet, and it&#039;s my main source of stress relief.  The fact that a few kind readers deem SYLG worthy enough to read both amazes and humbles me. </p>

Have you ever been wrong and admitted it?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
No!  Not at all!!  NEXT QUESTION!!!  I thought Scott Peterson would be acquitted and Kobe Bryant would be convicted.  Man, I really dropped the ball there.  I thought there was no way Hillary Clinton would be elected U.S. Senator.  What was I thinking?  I thought SYLG would land an interview at Basil&#039;s.  Hey, I&#039;m one for four!  Whoo hoo!  I like to say that I am wrong more times before 9am than most people are all day.</p>

What makes you happiest?</p>
<p><img src="http://i79.photobucket.com/albums/j134/basilsblog2/wyatt.jpg" alt="wyatt" width="150" height="150" border="0" /><br />
Bubble baths, sunsets, and unicorns.  Sorry, that&#039;s what makes Miss June happiest.  I&#039;m a simple man.  (Read: Big, dumb guy.)  If you omit the usual answers of family, friends, etc., my answer is playing ice hockey.  Even at 37, I still get a thrill lacing up the skates and stepping onto the ice.  The rink is my happy place.  It&#039;s the greatest game in the world.</p>

Vic Mackey or Andy Sipowicz?</p>

Although I probably look more like Andy, Vic is the man.  He is the cop that every cop wants to be, whether he or she admit it or not. </p>
