<p>As the rest of the nation ponders solutions to Iraq war troubles, progressive bloggers are also mired in their own strategic quagmire in CT. After toppling Sen. <b>Joe Lieberman</b> (I-CT) in the 8/8 Dem primary, progressives are finding it more difficult than anticipated to rid themselves permanently of the 18-year incumbent. Now that it's clear cable exec <b>Ned Lamont</b> (D-CT) faces a tough battle that threatens to drain progressive resources and attention from other races, as well as draw out GOPers in close House races, some are arguing that Lamont should be cut loose to focus on the larger war against the GOP. For now, the "stay the course" crowd is winning the debate. But a lot, as they say, can change between now and 11/06.</p>

<p>Sen. <b>John Kerry</b>'s (D-MA) 8/20 comparison of Sen. <b>Joe Lieberman</b> (I-CT) to VP <b>Cheney</b> on ABC's <i>This Week</i> (video <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/Politics/story?id=2334709&page=1&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312">here</a>) led the league in blogger reaction 8/20.</p>

<p><a href="http://ronbeas2.blogspot.com/2006/08/question-democrats-should-be-asking.html"><b>Middle Earth Journal</b></a> thought the description was pretty accurate and wanted to see more Dems take a similar position: "So where do some of the other personalities in the Democratic party fall. We will find out in the next couple of weeks. The litmus test will be if they actively campaign for Ned Lamont. Now it's really nice that many of them have endorsed Lamont but that's not enough. Are they going to side with the pro-neocon Republican Lite of the DLC or a majority of the base. Yes, they are going to have to decide who they are going to alienate. This is especially true of any who have presidential aspirations. Yes, Hillary I'm talking to you and that goes for Bill as well. Yes, Joe Biden I'm talking to you. The next couple of weeks you need to decide - are you with us or against us?"</p>

<p><a href="http://connecticutblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/help-me-count-joe-liebermans-lies.html"><b>CT Blog</b></a> has video of Lieberman on <i>Face The Nation</i> and asks readers to "point out Joe's lie in the interview." Under the header "Iraq Better Than One Year Ago, Worse Than Six Months Ago" <a href="http://lamontblog.blogspot.com/2006/08/joe-iraq-better-than-one-year-ago.html"><b>Lamont Blog</b></a> was already on the case, summarizing Lieberman positions on Iraq: "July 6th: Iraq better than it was a year ago. Iraqi military ready to lead the fight. August 20th: Iraq worse than it was six months ago. Iraqi military not ready to lead the fight."</p>

<p>Conservatives also noted the dust up. <b>Allahpundit</b> at <a href="http://hotair.com/archives/2006/08/20/video-kerry-on-lieberman-lieberman-on-kerry/"><b>Hot Air</b></a> posted heavily edited video of the two performances but questions recent Lieberman personnel decisions: "Question: is he going too far to woo Republican voters? James Joyner notes that Liebs just hired Neil Newhouse, a pollster who, literally, has never had a Democrat for a client. Connecticut's a blue state last I checked; as such, he might do well to worry a little more about alienating left-wing fencesitters than right-wingers who would sooner burn their ballot than vote for the McGovernite candidate."</p>

<p>Also on the right <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/007853.php"><b>Captain's Quarters</b></a> finds the Lieberman-Cheney comparison farcical: "Democrats seem intent on painting Joe Lieberman as a pariah these days. The ever-ridiculous Kerry has to push it even farther with a ludicrous comparison to conservative Dick Cheney. I doubt that Cheney ever garnered a 75 rating with NARAL (identical to <b>Chris Dodd</b>), nor did the VP's legislative voting record land him square in the middle of the Democratic caucus, as does Lieberman's."</p>

<p><b>DK</b> at <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009470.php"><b>Talking Points Memo</b></a> set off a lefty blogswarm by questioning progressive priorities in CT: "Should progressives shift their money and attention from the Connecticut Senate race to more important contests? Lamont v. Lieberman is a carnival sideshow, a titillating and distracting spectacle. Rove is the carnival barker. So ignore the hoopla and keep moving on down the midway, folks. The main event is still to come, and it will be in places like Montana, Missouri, and Ohio. We've come too far to get side-tracked now. Absolutely."</p>

<p><a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_08_13_atrios_archive.html#115599039373190192"><b>Atrios</b></a> was annoyed by DK's focus: "I'd like more of that advice going to, say, the people who gave money so that <b>Hillary Clinton</b> could have $22 million cash-on-hand. Does <b>Bill Nelson</b> need $12 million to run against <b>Katie Harris</b>? On the House side, does <b>Marty Meehan</b>, who won with 67% of the vote last time, really need to have 5 million bucks in the bank? There is always an incredible misallocation of resources in elections and that's the money which flows to incumbents. Sure, they're not all safe and it's understandable that they need somewhat of a defensive warchest just in case, but if you want to criticize where donors are directing their money (and attention) start there."</p>

<p><b>Nathan Newman</b> at <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2006/aug/19/challenger_money_incumbent_money"><b>TPM Cafe</b></a> linked to data on HRC campaign fund sources and questioned Atrios' reasoning: "That incumbent money isn't progressive money that cares whether Dems control the Senate-- it's money by special interests looking to buy access and influence with those with potential power. .. So the issue for labor and ideological groups is not whether to give money to Hillary or Lamont-- almost none of them are doing so now.  The groups interested in progressive control of the Senate are choosing between Lamont and [Sherrod] Brown and [Clair] McGaskill.   Talking about lobbyists giving money to Hillary has little to do with the choices progressive groups are making in deciding which challengers to fund to increase progressive power."</p>

<p>DK <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009473.php">fired back</a> on his own: "Call me crazy, but I think I'll stick with criticizing the circular firing squad that is the Lieberman-Lamont race, rather than focusing on whether everyone has their fair share of bullets, as Atrios seems to want to do." <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_08_13_atrios_archive.html#115601147898309420"><b>Atrios</b></a> responded by shifting the blame to Dem leadership: "this race is about more than Lamont now, it's about 3 important House races that Lieberman's going to [mess up] with all of his Republican pals. Attention must be paid by time-wasters like myself because too many of the powers that be have apparently forgotten that they do, indeed, have a Lieberman Problem. It's not a circular firing squad, it's the implicit Republican candidate (Lieberman) versus the explicit Democratic one (Lamont). Joe's going to try to win by bringing Republicans to the polls, and when he does it won't be the fault of Lamont supporters, it'll be the fault of Lieberman and Dems who failed to confront him."</p>

<p>Consensus on the left centered on the value of Lieberman's defeat outside CT:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>AR</b> at <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009476.php"><b>Talking Points Memo</b></a>: "Strategically, those of us who work on "brand architecture" understand the notion of "anchor brands". This race is not an either/or proposition (support Lamont and ignore the other races). There is an interaction effect -- the more traction Lamont gets, the more the "Democrat" brand benefits, and vice versa."</li>
<li>mcjoan at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/19/2016/78070"><b>DailyKos</b></a>: "What is important in this race, and why it deserves the attention it has garnered not only in the blogosphere, but also in the traditional media, is the national implications it has. ...

<li>a <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009484.php"><b>TPM</b></a> reader: "Sorry but with your and Atrios' blog battle over Joe Momentum the real issue is being missed. This is now an issue about the basis of the Democratic Party - if Lieberman gets re-elected as a Independent after loosing a Democratic Party primary and the Dems in the Senate welcome him back into their caucus like nothing has happened our Party is dead.

There's a partisan divide, sure, but there's a much bigger divide between those on the inside of the Hill and those of us who aren't.

<p>Conservative bloggers read Sen. <b>John Kerry</b>'s (D-MA) 8/20 comparison of Sen. <b>Joe Lieberman</b> (I-CT) and VP <b>Cheney</b> as part of Kerry's '08 ambitions. <a href="http://bluecrabboulevard.com/2006/08/20/court-jester/"><b>Blue Crab Boulevard</b></a>: "Mindlessly ambitious, Kerry does not realize how utterly silly he sounds these days. This is a fundamentally uncurious person with a long record of mediocrity (that being the kindest assessment of his political career). His vilification of Lieberman is all about Joe's failure to recant a position that Kerry once openly backed. A position that Kerry abandoned not out of principle, but to advance his career."</p>

<p><a href="http://ace.mu.nu/archives/193259.php"><b>Ace of Spades</b></a> also focussed on Kerry's principles: "Republicans voted for the Iraq War because they believed in it. ... Democrats voted for the Iraq War, a war they believed was doomed to become a Vietnam-style quagmire, in order to to retain/expand political power. Which is worse? John Kerry voted for a war he never believed in, and always thought would result in thousands of American casualties, because he was too chicken[excrement] to voice his true beliefs." <a href="http://decision08.net/2006/08/20/john-kerry-the-biggest-ahole-in-politics/"><b>Decision '08</b></a> questioned Kerry's commitment to democracy: "Tell me something, Mr. Jackass - er, I mean, Senator Kerry; if Joe Lieberman is so out of touch with the voters of Connecticut, why are you attacking him? His Independent candidacy doesn't matter, right, since he'll surely lose? Isn't the Democratic Party big enough for dissent, or is it a Soviet-style home for apparatchiks now?</p>

<p><b>Pamela Leavey</b><a href="http://blog.thedemocraticdaily.com/?p=3944"><b>The Democratic Daily</b></a> responded to Decision'08 directly: "When John Kerry spoke out about Joe Lieberman on 'This Week' today, he spoke out because Lieberman is "making a Republican case," and "adopting the rhetoric of Dick Cheney," on the issue of Iraq. Kerry spoke out not only about Lieberman but the Republican "stay the course" rhetoric. In a word, what Kerry said today was classic "dissent" against Iraq and the current administration. Sorry Decision '08, but you can't have it both ways. Kerry's entire interview today with George Stephanopoulos was all about "dissent" - "dissent" against an administration out of control, a president who has overstepped his authority over and over again."</p>

<p><i>Natural Born Killers</i> producer and progressive activist <b>Jane Hamsher</b> at <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/08/20/three-cheers-for-kerry/">firedoglake</a> also sang Kerry's praises: "Kerry has done the right thing before - he had the courage to lead the filibuster against Alito even though he knew all the hacks were going to accuse him of pandering to the base. ... but Kerry now looks prophetic - Alito is a third-rate legal mind who owes his fealty to the fundies, and Kerry's actions will be well remembered both in the blogosphere and the history books." <b>SusanG</b> at <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/8/20/114513/792"><b>DailyKos</b></a> argues Kerry has defined a new litmus test for all '08ers: "Let's hope all 2008 hopefuls jump on the bandwagon and begin to realize that cutting Joe off is one non-negotiable requirement to nomination."</p>

<p>Conservative <a href="http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/007859.php"><b>Captain's Quarters</b></a> looks at a <i>New York Times</i> 8/21 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/21/washington/21mccain.html?ex=1313812800&en=4953508f1a5c85f6&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss">article</a> on Sen. <b>John McCain</b> (R-AZ) recruiting efforts in SC and sees "the heart of this article is the question as to whether McCain is the logical choice to bear the Bush mantle into another election. However, outside of war policy and taxes, many Republicans may ask themselves if they want to continue the policies of <b>George Bush</b> at all, especially on domestic spending. And this is where McCain has the advantage."</p>

<p>CQ sees two major barriers between McCain and the GOP base: "McCain still has to answer for the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, the monstrosity that put political-speech restrictions into American law. Conservatives have opposed this strongly since before it passed Congress, and are not likely to trust McCain with executive power while he continues to support government restrictions on political speech. Had it not been for the BCRA, McCain could probably have won the nomination by acclaim. ... Nor will they easily trust him with judicial appointments, not after his Gang of 14 grandstanding maneuver. McCain gave liberals cover for their assertions that prominent jurists like <b>Henry Saad</b> and <b>Janice Rogers Brown</b> were either incompetent or too radical to sit on appellate courts."</p>

<p><b>Machiavel</b> at <a href="http://www.redstate.com/stories/elections/2008/we_are_the_new_deciders"><b>RedState</b></a> also looks at McCain maneuverings in SC, <a href="http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2006/08/post_56.html"><b>Hotline On Call</b></a> (go team!) report on McCain locking up Maj. General <b>Stan Spears</b>, and argues McCain is barking up the wrong tree: "McCain is in essence fighting the last war, locking up the endorsements he imagines were denied to him last time. ... In short, McCain thinks he was doomed by a powerful, insular cabal of Republican insiders, so he's building a powerful, insular cabal of his own. But Bush in 2000 also had plenty of grassroots support and led decisively in public opinion polls, while McCain's position with the grassroots is much more precarious and will likely remain so."</p>

It is nothing but a declaration of defeat dressed up to look like a vision for the future. Not only would abandoning Iraq to its fate now be irresponsible, it would almost certainly lead to disintegration and dictatorship, with a high risk of a wide regional conflict.</blockquote><br />

<p><b>Tom Hayden</b> at <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tom-hayden/what-the-peace-movement-s_b_27660.html"><b>The Huffington Post</b></a> offers up a six point peace movement platform on violence in the Middle East:</p><br />
<ul><li>Instead of staying the course, we demand that our officials immediately change the course we are on. <br />
Instead, we must prevent a military escalation by our stalemated warmakers. There should be no US or [US-backed] Israeli bombing against Iran or Syria. We demand to know if the White House and Pentagon have any active plans to do so, as reported by such reputable sources as <b>Seymour Hersh</b>.</li><li>Second, we demand that the White House yield to the bipartisan Congressional demand that there be no funding of permanent military bases in Iraq.</li><li>Third, we demand a timetable for ending the US occupation and bringing the US troops home. We will petition and demand that the White House relinquish its formal role to the United Nations Security Council when a re-authorization vote is scheduled later this year.</li><li>Fourth, a "Marshall Plan" for Iraq. A US transfer to the UN would permit a fresh approach to negotiations with the insurgents, reconciliation, humanitarian assistance, reconstruction. and transitional security arrangements. We must shift from unilateralism to multi-lateralism. </li><li>Fifth, respect for the sovereignty of Iraq in all its diversity must be at the heart of any transition. A UN-appointed body must mediate the complex issues of amnesty for those who fought the occupation, and an agreement on equitable power sharing concerning oil revenues and security arrangements, among other issues. Proposals for a false federalism that would actually subdivide the country into satelites should be rejected.</li><li>Finally, the US will have to change course in the region, seriously promote a viable Palestinian state, and abandon all neo-conservative fantasies of turning Sunnis against Shiites in a regional sectarian conflict.</li><br />

<p><a href="http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000547.php"><b>The Sneeze</b></a> shares a story of his six-year-old Game Show Network loving son dinner antics:</p>

<p>My 6-year-old (<a href="http://www.thesneeze.com/mt-archives/000489.php">who's now okay with being six</a>) has been watching the Game Show Network. I know this because he turned our dinner into a game show in which he was the host and I was the contestant. The rules are easy. You're given a multiple choice question with 4 possible answers. Each question is worth 1 million dollars. What makes the game fun is sometimes the questions don't make sense, sometimes there's more than one correct answer and sometimes he's just wrong.</p>

<p>It's very entertaining to watch him run the game, especially as he comes up with the multiple choice answers on the fly. I wrote down all the questions and answers, essentially creating a "home version." [For space the Blogometer offers one example].</p>
2. Which restaurant invented chicken?
A) Islands
B) Deli
