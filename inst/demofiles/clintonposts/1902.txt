<br />Kofi Annan arrived in Monrovia amidst heavy security yesterday evening after paying a visit to Sierra Leone. The intense security surrounding his visit reflected the latent paranoia of civil unrest here in Monrovia, and the main road from Roberts International Airport to the Pan-African Plaza (UNMIL headquarters) downtown was completely closed to traffic from 6pm until 10pm. Liberian riot police and UN troops lined the entire route and blanketed the city. Things came to a standstill. The precautions seemed a bit extreme. Was it really necessary to shut down the city from late afternoon onwards, even if the visitor is the UN Secretary General?<br />
<br />Today, with Kofi Annan in meetings, several hundred Liberians marched on the UNMIL headquarters in support of the establishment of a war crimes tribunal in Liberia. The demonstrators wore black t-shirts and carried 16 caskets on their shoulders to symbolize those who died in Liberiaâs 14 years of civil warâ-one casket to represent the dead from each of Liberiaâs 15 counties, and one casket to represent the international peacekeepers and foreign nationals who also perished in the war.<br />

<br />The group that organized the demonstrationâ-a local activist organization calling itself the Forum for the Establishment of a War Crimes Courtâ-failed to obtain a permit for the demonstration and was warned against staging the march. The demonstration was held despite the warnings. Fortunately, the Liberian government let the demonstrators proceed, and the governmentâs tolerance was perhaps the most significant display of the day. The demonstrators also successfully delivered a petition to a UN official to be forwarded to the UN Security Council in New York City. The petition requests the Security Council to consider a resolution for the establishment of a hybrid Special War Crimes Court for Liberia (similar to the one established in Sierra Leone) to prosecute those most responsible for atrocities in Liberia in the last decade and a half. But the establishment of such a court is unlikely in the foreseeable future. The creation of a hybrid war crimes tribunal would require the consent of the Liberian government, which is improbable given that many of those responsible for the conflict remain in power, including the House Speaker Edwin Snowe (the former son-in-law of ex-president Charles Taylor), Senator Jewel Howard Taylor (Taylorâs wife), Senator Adolphus Dolo (a former general under Taylorâs government), and Senator Prince Johnson of Nimba County (the former leader of the now defunct Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia, who can be seen in a blue hat peering over Charles Taylorâs shoulder in <a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/6106/671/1600/Taylor.Warlord.jpg">this picture</a>).<br />

<br />Despite the long odds, the Forum for the Establishment of a War Crimes Court has been very vocal of late. It is not too keen on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission as the chosen institution for transitional justice. Members of the group delivered a similar petition to the National Legislature five weeks ago seeking domestic legislation to establish a war crimes court. The 21-page petition, which was read aloud by the House Clerk, enumerated the alleged massacres, atrocities, summary executions, and other crimes committed by members of the current Legislature and government, including the âbutcheringâ of 400,000 Liberians, the raping of over 50,000 underage girls, and âthe hacking off of limbs coupled with the betting murder game that saw pregnant womenâs stomachs ripped open.â The accuracy of their casualty figures is impossible to confirm, but even if the numbers are outsized and hyperbolic (and they could just as well be short of the mark), their descriptions of the atrocities reflect the truth.<br />
<br />This morning, Kofi Annan was set to address a joint session of the National Legislature, followed by more meetings with UNMIL and the various UN agencies around town. In conjunction with his visit, the University of Liberia announced a proposal to establish a new Kofi Annan School of Peace and Development Studies. More high-profile visitors are expected in Monrovia in the coming weeks. Former President Bill Clinton, British Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, and heads of the World Bank and African Development Bank are expected to arrive in Monrovia around July 12 for a donorâs conference on Liberiaâs poverty reduction strategy, including proposals for canceling some of Liberiaâs close to US $3.5 billion in external debt.</div>
