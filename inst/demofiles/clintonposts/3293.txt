<div>In the last few days we have had a number of interesting things said and done by the liberals who run the Democrat party that point out how insane they really are.<br />
<br />Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean said last week that, â<em>Republicans havenât worked an honest day in their lives</em>.â<br />
<br />Today he said, â<em>Republicans all behave the same. They all look the same. Itâs pretty much a white Christian party</em>.â<br />
<br />This just a few weeks after Dean stated â<em>I hate all Republicans."</em>
<br />
<br />Hillary Clinton stated yesterday that the Bush administration is, "<em>intent upon consolidating and abusing power.</em>" This from the woman whose husband abused more than just power. (See Monica Lewinski).<br />
<br />Newsweek Magazine had to retract a story about a Koran abused by being flushed down a toilet when it turned out to be made up and only sourced by a single person.<br />
<br />The International Red Cross, an extreme leftist group not be confused with the American Red Cross, has said that the U.S. terrorist prisoner camp in Cuba, âIs no better than a Nazi Concentration camp.â<br />
<br />Amnesty International, a far left group that donated thousands of dollars to the Kerry campaign, has said that the U.S. is running âGulagsâ. Comparing Quantanomo Bay to the Soviet Death camps not only proves that Amnesty International is a whacko group, but that they canât even get their history right.<br />
<br />But that is the danger. Neither do the American people know their history. And the left is counting on that as they proceed with their final solution to the âBush Problemâ.<br />
<br />That solution is Impeaching Bush.<br />
<br />I kid you not.<br />
<br />Right now there are at least 7 web sites calling for the Impeachment of President Bush.<br />
<br />For what?<br />
<br />War Crimes.<br />
<br />Take your pick from below of the war crimes Bush is guilty of according to the insane liberals:<br />
<br />
<strong>We ignored the U.N. and invaded a country</strong>. (Not trueâ¦the U.N. authorized the war. But the hell with the U.N anyway.)<br />
<br />
<strong>We are torturing and KILLING prisoners</strong>. (Not trueâUnderwear on the head and a women with the top button undone on her uniform is not torture, unless you are a gay liberal.)<br />
<br />
<strong>Indefinite imprisonment of the terrorists is torture</strong>. (Not trueâthey can be held forever).<br />
<br />
<strong>The U.S. Has abused the Koran</strong>. (Since when do the liberals care about a religious book?) But no intentional abuse has happened. One copy of the Koran got urine on it when the wind blew it from a vent onto the book. How does that compare to American Liberals banning the Bible in schools?<br />
<br />What about all the Korans that were DESTROYED When Al Qaeda blew up a mosque last week? Where is the outrage then? Oh thatâs right. They are allowed to destroy their holy book. We get in trouble for even supplying them to prisoners out of the kindness of our hearts.<br />
<br />The left is also crying that the terrorists have no legal help. Seems the nutsy left thinks we should be giving lawyers to all the terrorists in our military prisons. Itâs unfortunate for the left that the Geneva Convention agreements does not require that of ANY of these prisoners since they are NOT Prisoners of War. They wear no uniform of any country that is a signer of the Geneva Accords. Therefore these prisoners have no rights other than what we CHOOSE to give them.<br />
<br />The prisoners are also being told to cry âtortureâ the minute they are caught and detained. The Al Qaeda guidebook, recently updated and obtained by the U.S. forces, explains in detail how to do this. So the American liberal left is now on the same page as the terrorists.<br />
<br />Nice.<br />
<br />The nutsy left thinks that this War Crimes tactic is their ticket back to power. Impeach Bush and take over the country! I can hear the Howard Dean scream now. Yippee!!!!<br />
<br />I was hoping for the impeachment Of Bill Clinton for years. I sold IMPEACH CLINTON stickers at race tracks and by mail starting the month after Clinton was elected. I thought it would ultimately be for all the fraud and crimes he did as Arkansas Governor. Who could have thought that Bubba would get caught by the Blue Dress and a true hero named Linda Tripp? (As opposed to a criminal traitor like Deep Throat).<br />
<br />When the gutless Republicans in the Senate failed us all and let the âSex Fiend In Chiefâ walk they did no one any favors, except that maybe now it means the very word Impeachment is taboo to thinking people.<br />
<br />How the hell do the liberals think they can Impeach Bush when the Articles Of Impeachment they scribble in crayon are 100% false?<br />
<br />Clinton lost his law license and his place in history because of what he did.<br />
<br />Bush will lose his breath laughing so hard when he reads what his enemies think is a logical argument for his impeachment.<br />
<br />But the liberals donât care.<br />
<br />They are so angry and outrageous because they have nothing left.<br />
<br />They canât win elections.<br />They have lost the White House.<br />They have lost the U.S. Senate.<br />They have lost the House Of Representatives.<br />They have lost the Red States.<br />They canât control their whackiness and their screwy people.<br />They canât come up with anything positive to say or do.<br />They canât stop the Republicans from running the government.<br />They have lost control of the media.<br />They are headed for the dustbin of history, but donât know it yet.<br />
<br />The liberals have a right to be angry, at <strong>themselves</strong>.<br />
<br />They blew it and they know it.<br />
<br />All they have left to do is throw on their sandals and tie dye and protest and scream âImpeach Bush!â<br />
<br />In Matworld they can scream all they want as we Republicans pick the next few Supreme Court Judges, reform the tax code, save Social Security and rule the country with sanity.<br />
