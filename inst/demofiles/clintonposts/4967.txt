<span><b>Chinese Training Military in Latin  America</b></span>  <blockquote><span><b><i>NewsMax.com    Wires</i></b></span><br /><span><b><i>Wednesday,    March 15, 2006</i></b></span> </blockquote><!--#include virtual="/includes/article_package.shtml" --> <p>WASHINGTON -- China is training increasing numbers of Latin American military  personnel, taking advantage of a three-year old U.S. law that has led to a sharp  decline in U.S.-run training programs for the region, an Army general said  Tuesday. </p><p> </p><p>Gen. Bantz Craddock, who oversees U.S. military operations in Latin America,  said military members of all ranks are receiving training in China, In addition,  he said, more and more Chinese non-lethal military equipment is showing up in  the region...It's a growing phenomenon." </p><p> </p><p>Craddock testified before a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing where  lawmakers from both parties called for the elimination of the law that  authorizes U.S. training programs only under certain conditions - requirements  that some countries refuse to accept. </p><p> </p><p>The measure has given the Chinese military an opening in Latin America for  the first time. </p><p> </p><p>Committee Chairman John Warner expressed concern over the Chinese activities  as did Sen. Carl Levin, the ranking Democrat on the panel. Sen. John McCain  suggested that repeal of the amendment should be included in an emergency  supplemental legislation now being considered. </p><p><!--#include virtual="/includes/banner_275x150.txt" --> </p><p> </p><p>Said Sen. Hillary Clinton, "I think this is one of the most serious problems  we face," alluding to the Chinese actions. The committee has a duty to "sound  the alarm," she added. </p><p> </p><p>At issue is a U.S. law that mandates an end to military training in countries  that refuse to exempt U.S. citizens overseas from the jurisdiction of the  International Criminal Court. </p><p> </p><p>Nations that join the ICC can evade U.S. sanctions by signing an agreement  with the United States that provides Americans immunity from ICC prosecution. </p><p> </p><p>Twelve Latin American countries have declined to do so and are now subject to  sanctions. Craddock testified that in 2003, a year before the law took effect,  the United States trained 771 military personnel from countries that are now  sanctioned. </p><p> </p><p>The training curriculum, he said in his prepared testimony, includes  instruction on the importance of civilian supremacy in the governing process. </p><p><!--#include virtual="/includes/sponsorbox.shtml" --> </p><p> </p><p>The reduced U.S. role, he said, "opens the door for competing nations and  outside political actors who may not share our democratic principles." </p><p> </p><p>Lawmakers approved the legislation out of concern that Americans overseas,  including military personnel, diplomats and ordinary citizens, could be subject  to politically motivated ICC prosecutions. </p><p> </p><p>The ICC was set up four years ago under U.N. sponsorship in an attempt to  ensure that perpetrators of genocide or crimes against humanity are brought to  justice. </p><p> </p><p>On another subject, Craddock said that Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez was  playing a "destabilizing" role in the region by trying to export his "extreme  populist movement" elsewhere in the region. </p><p> </p><p>Among Venezuela's target countries, Craddock said, are Peru and Nicaragua,  both of which are due to hold presidential elections later this year. </p><p> </p><p>Venezuela's actions, Craddock said, are making its more difficult for these  countries to establish democratic roots. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Â© 2006 Associated Press.
