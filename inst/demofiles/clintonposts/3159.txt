<div>I do not believe that George Bush is, in any clinical sense, insane.  He is rational; when he opens his eyes, he sees the same world, to an extent, that everybody else does.  That tree in front of him is the same tree that his wife sees.  On the other hand, something is desperately, desperately wrong.<br />
<br />"Brownie, you're doing a heck of a job."  <br />
<br />Now, a psychotic break is an actual break with reality:  a man literally no longer inhabits the same world of sense data that we do.  We're not talking about mere differences in perspective, which are sometimes radical:  I accept that Tom DeLay, for instance, looks at the same scenario that I do, and sees something utterly alien from what I see.  But if we were to put a drowning man in the water in front of us, both of us would say:  there is a man, who is drowning.<br />
<br />George Bush does not see the drowning man.  He just doesn't see him.  He sees a man, thrashing in the water -- as I say, he's not in any clinical sense psychotic -- but the fact that a man is drowning simply does not register.<br />
<br />Actually, the symptoms are more subtle and constrained.   If the drowning might somehow <i>implicate him,</i> only then does he cease to perceive the essence of what is happening before his eyes.<br />
<br />I am not being sarcastic.  I honestly believe that this man has an internal mechanism, whereby the world in front of him cannot be apprehended, should there be some sense in which reality reflects badly upon his actions.  It is a kind of selective blindness, exacerbated no doubt by his choir of rigorous sycophants -- "no sir, you're absolutely right sir, everything's just fine sir" -- but it's more than that.  <i>There is something wrong with this man.</i>
<br />
<br />I first became aware of this during the last presidential debates:  that astonishing moment in which Bush could not identify a single thing that he had mishandled as president.  And, when pressed to produce some kind of answer, the result was utterly revealing:  he regretted a couple of appointments he'd made.  In other words, he regretted that <i>other people,</i> beneath him, had made errors.<br />
<br />We have seen this automatic response repeatedly in the past few days:  <i>somebody</i> has made mistakes, perhaps, but not me. "The results are not acceptable."  George, <i>people's actions</i> are what produce results.  Where is the first person in that statement?  When at last he produces the royal "we," it's in the context of Reagan-like platitudes regarding the American way:  "In America we do not abandon our fellow citizens in their hour of need."  Well, this is America, George, and <i>you,</i> George, have done just that.<br />
<br />This character flaw (that term seems somehow inadequate) was already fully evident in the debates with Kerry. The sheer petulance with which George denied that there was any misjudgment in going to war with Iraq -- the child-like annoyance with the possibility that anyone might even imply such a thing -- was not simply appalling, it was amazing.  There was no hint of dishonesty in that display (and believe you me, I have no illusions regarding George's pathological mendacity) -- no, he really meant it.  He was truly annoyed.  The suggestion of misprision drove him, almost, to a tantrum.<br />
<br />At the risk of being charged with vulgar sexism, it is not surprising that in recent days the most pointed critique of Bush's mindboggling immaturity has come from women.  Mary Landrieu, Nancy Pelosi, Hillary Clinton:  George's behavior brings out an archetypally maternal response -- the urge to say "for god's sake, <i>grow up.</i>"  This urge is, in fact, the potential salvation of the Democratic Party.  Men tend to treat George as a man, to evaluate him as they might themselves:  as an adult, who is making bad decisions.  These women, on the other hand, have nailed it -- it does no good to treat him as a responsible grown-up.  The problem is precisely this:  that he is <i>not</i> an adult.  Children may not be psychotic, but they do not see the world in the same way as adults; when they screw up, they have to be <i>forced</i> to recognize culpability, and to accept blame.<br />
<br />You would have expected Senator Landrieu to take a lot more heat when she finally said, in exasperation, that she would "punch" Bush if he did not finally accept that this disaster was the responsibility of <i>his</i> administration.  Yet few but the most craven ideologues criticized her remark:  because most of us, I suspect -- Republicans included -- felt precisely the same way.  You wanted to slap him until he recognized that he was expected to behave as a grown man.  I happen to be strongly opposed to corporal punishment, but I cannot deny the strong urge to use it, when children simply refuse to acknowledge and take responsibility for egregious misbehavior.  (Luckily, corporal punishment will not be necessary in this case.  The constitution provides effective alternatives to a rap on the knuckles.)<br />
<br />Here is what common sense sounds like:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/09/07/national/w095209D05.DTL">'At a news conference,</a> (Nancy) Pelosi, D-Calif., said Bush's choice for head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency had "absolutely no credentials."<br />
<br />'She related that she had urged Bush at the White House on Tuesday to fire Michael Brown.<br />
<br />'"He said 'Why would I do that?'" Pelosi said.<br />
<br />'"'I said because of all that went wrong, of all that didn't go right last week.' And he said 'What didn't go right?'"<br />
<br />'"Oblivious, in denial, dangerous," she added.'<br />
<br />Yes, I am being deliberately provocative (I believe the chic expression is no longer "sexist," but "essentialist") -- a few <i>men</i> too have had the good sense to recognize what's going on here -- but women have been by far the most eloquent in recent days, and have become the credible voice of the Democratic Party.  It is a question of behaving like adults, and insisting that others do the same.<br />
<br />Of course, there are dangers in this analysis:  if you infantilize the president, you are in some ways excusing his behavior.  But I remind you that -- strictly speaking -- we are not dealing with an actual child here.  George is, physically and mentally (if not psychologically) a fully grown man.  My intent is not to excuse his behavior, but to stress that these women -- may one of them become president -- have precisely the right approach:  just don't take any nonsense from this petulant, obnoxious child.  Simply refuse.  It's time to grow up.  You're going to have to take responsibility, George, and yes, you are probably going to be punished.</div>
