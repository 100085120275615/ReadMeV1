Good morning guys...how are you doing today?<br /><br />Good we hope. So nice to see you here, and we both hope that your day is going well.<br /><br />We are Steve and Warren...and our weather in the Duluth, Minnesota area this morning is partly cloudy and 61 degrees.<br /><br />Not to bad out there today. Forecast for today is calling for partly cloudy skies and a high of 70 degrees. Yesterday was really a fantastic day here...warm breezes, very little humidity - just great.<br /><br />-A state senator responsible for some of Utah's most anti-gay legislation is under fire for saying that the landmark court case that ended state-sanctioned segregation is wrong.<br /><br />-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY) is holding up renewal of the Ryan White Act, the law which funds most HIV/AIDS campaigns across the country, and some health care workers in the field suggest that her expected presidential bid may have something to do with it.<br /><br />-Young gay college students were turned down when they attempted to enlist at military recruitment centers in Austin, Chicago, Oklahoma City.<br /><br />-Things We've Read:<br /><ul><li>Tablecloths were originally meant to serve as towels with which guests could wipe their hands and faces after dinner.</li><li>Walt Disney, the creator of Mickey Mouse, was afraid of mice. </li><li>Henry Ford was Charles Lindbergh's first passenger in the Spirit of St. Louis.</li></ul><p>-There are days when I just hate "Blogger"...and today is one of those days. I have been sitting here ( just using the regular Blogger create new post window ) but for the life of me, I can not upload another photograph to this blog for today. This can be so frustrating...you just can't believe.</p><p>I think I need to upload all the photos first, before I start typing anything into the blog - because it seems that the system will allow that - but if there is type or text in the blog - I can't upload a photo.</p><p>Goofy isn't it? I sure think so. Unless, I am doing something wrong in the process. Hmmmmm!</p><p>-Steve is up and I am headed for the shower in a few minutes. I can see the bedroom light is on...he has to be to work about 15 minutes earlier today, because of a regular Thursday safety meeting. </p><p>Steve got home last night fairly early...which was really sweet. I had the gas grill out in the back yard near the patio - and we grilled hamburgers for supper, along with some baked beans, and a few tater tots. It was really pretty good.</p><p>After supper Steve washed a few clothes and then we headed over to the laundromat to dry them. Our new dryer won't be here until next week. </p><p>-Things To Be Happy About:</p><ul><li>rings</li><li>auction catalogs</li><li>colored photos</li><li>English Leather and Old Spice</li><li>writing a haiku</li></ul><p>-Ok, I know ... your sitting there reading this blog and wondering, what in the heck is "haiku". Well, Haiku is a very important form of traditional Japanese poetry. It is based on a Zen Buddhist philosophy of brevity and simplicty and is believed to have originated in the 17th century. Haikus are designed to convey the essence of an experience in a short format. Traditional haikus frequently mention natural themes or images and are often yearning or wistful in tone. </p><p>The name haiku arose in response to confusion surrounding related Japanese poetry terms. Hokku, meaning "starting verse" was usually the basis of a longer string of verses, called haika. Because it was considered a privileged art form, poets would often compose a hokku and stop there. The term haiku was coined in the 1890s to denote this new and self-contained type of poetry.</p><p>Japanese haikus follow strict rules. Those written in other languages have more flexibility but all follow a similar pattern.</p><p>You can learn more about "haiku" by going to this <a href="http://www.toyomasu.com/haiku/#whatishaiku">website</a>.</p><p>-Our Minnesota Twins won last night, beating Baltimore 4 to 1. Speaking of sports...it won't be long and our Minnesota Timberwolves will be swinging into action. I wonder what kind of a season they are going to have?</p><p>Steve and I are holding out for a good season, but we are not getting our hopes up to high.</p><p>-Wow, tomorrow is Friday...thank goodness. This has been a busy week for me and for Steve. How about you guys...been busy? Well, we hope your day is a great one. We are going to enjoy our upcoming weekend...not sure of what we are going to do, but nonetheless it will be fun no matter what happens.</p><p>We really haven't been to a movie for a couple of weeks, so I am sure we will take one or two in this weekend. How about you? What do you and your mate or if your single...have planned? Why don't you share with us in the comments section. We'd love to hear from you.</p><p>My shower is calling...and I'd better get my buns moving here guys. Have a great Thursday and be kind.</p><p>Ciao~</p>
