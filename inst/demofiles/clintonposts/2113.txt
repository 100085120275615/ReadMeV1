<em>Asked why Clinton might countenance lower funding for Southern and rural states, Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the nation's largest community-based HIV/AIDS medical provider, said, "I don't think she expects to carry the South."</em>

<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2005/09/05/barbara-bush-to-katrina-v_n_6895.html">So all of HBO America got to hear what the rest of us New Orleanians heard at the time when Barbara Bush waxed philosphical about how the poor black "refugees" from New Orleans should have gotten down on their knees and kissed Mastuh George's ass for stuffing them into the Astrodome in Houston following Katrina because this kind and chartiable act on the part of the President's home state had actually "elevated" their pathetic lot in life. </a>

<div align="center">Yeah. Bush hates black people. Thanks for sharing that huge insight, brother West. Of course the truth is that Bush <em>specifically</em> hates blacks that don't walk, talk and act like a neocon white. <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/342707p-292600c.html">As long as you're a black gal that shops for fashionable shoes while hundreds of poor African-American United States citizens are drowing in an American city then you're just fine, cool and handy-dandy with the Prez.</a>

<div align="center">America also learned from Spike Lee's documentary that William Jefferson "The First Black President of the United States of America" Clinton stood idly by right next to Momma Bush and said nothing when she began foaming at the mouth her advanced race theories. Not that he was obliged to do so, but it would have made a lot of us in New Orleans feel just a little bit better had he rudely booted her in the ass during her interment speech.</div>

<em>In response, Clinton wrote to Alford yesterday, saying she agrees that AIDS "has had a disproportionate impact on people of color" and "that our federal government can do more." But she said that the Ryan White measure as drafted "would have a devastating impact on New York" and "unfairly shift millions of dollars in funding away from New York and other states that have been hardest hit by the epidemic, jeopardizing their ability to provide vital care and treatment services."</em>
