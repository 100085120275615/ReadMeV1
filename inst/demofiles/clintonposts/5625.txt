Here is the interview excerpt, <span>[with some personal observations]</span>:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>
<strong>Singer</strong>: One concern that many in the progressive blogosphere have about your campaign is your stance towards social issues, particularly the issue of abortion. To what extent will these social issues drive your actions in Congress? Or, put another way, would you seek a spot on the Judiciary Committee or other committees that are very focused in the battle over the social issues?<br />
<br />
<strong>Casey</strong>: I think in terms of... To work backwards for your question, in terms of any committees, Jonathan, you should know that because I'm both Irish and cautious, I never talk about committees.<br />
<br />[Laughter] <span>[Why is any of this funny? Why would you start an answer to a question about abortion with humor? Maybe I am over-reacting, but this does not strike me as an attempt at a serious response.]<br />
</span>
<br />Not when and until I'm elected. But to be serious about the question you raised, I think that one of the most important factors in the way a lot of Americans look at the issue of abortion is the question that they hope would happen more in Washington but it doesn't, and that is that a lot of Americans want people to be honest about where they stand and I have been, even when some members of the Democratic Party disagree with my position, and I think it's important to be honest about differences.<br />
<br />I also think it's very important to be respectful of people that disagree, and I've done that I think well as a public official. I've tried to be very respectful of people that disagree, especially when it comes to an issue like abortion that's important to people on both sides of the debate. </p>
<p>Despite all the division about it there is, their honest differences, I think there's a great consensus in this country, whether it's from the left or the right or the middle, that most Americans and most Pennsylvanians want to reduce the number of abortions, want to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies. They know what was in the recent New York Times column by Nicholas Kristoff where he talked about 3 million unintended pregnancies every year which lead to more than a million abortions, among other things.<br />
<br />So I think that there's a great consensus on family planning and birth control, which I have always supported as a public official and would support United States Senator. <span>[This support for birth control from a Catholic is troubling. Birth control is a problem, the Church teaches, not because it is opposed to sex within the bond of marriage but because it views new life as a burden to be avoided rather than as a gift to be cherished. Sen Santorum sees this, but it seems Mr Casey does not.] </span>Also the newer issue within the family planning discussion is emergency contraception, and the big difference between Senator Santorum and me in this race, I support it and he doesn't.<span> </span>
<span>[so is Mr Casey in support of easy access to EC by teens girls?]</span> And I've been criticized by some leaders in religious community - even in the Catholic community - for supporting emergency contraception. <span>[Is this some badge of pride? The reason Mr Casey is being "criticized" is that EC can be abortificient rather than contraceptive. So, EC can cause chemical abortions and that is an evil and immoral act. Pennsylvania voters should take note of this difference and the pride Mr Casey shows in pointing it out.]<br />
</span>
<br />And I also don't support litmus tests for judges and presidential candidates like Rick Santorum, who will always support the Republican candidate for President, I always support the Democrat even when that Democrat disagrees with me on an issue like abortion or any other issue. <span>[As John over at Santorum Blog points out, what Mr Casey is saying is <strong>"that he will always support Democrat judges and Democrat presidential candidates, no matter how liberal they are in their judicial philosophies and on the issues."</strong> I would question whether Mr Casey, notwithstanding his support for Justice Alito, would ever support Republican nominated judges.]<br />
</span>
<br />And I think with regard to very important related questions, Rick Santorum and his Republican friends will talk about family and talk about life and all of that, but when it comes to supporting a woman who makes a decision to bear a child, they don't do much for her. They abandon the mother and the child before, during and after birth. That's what they do when they cut or freeze Head Start, when they cut childcare, when they don't support public education, when they don't support food and nutrition programs that are essential for a child in the dawn of his or her life and the mother who has to take upon herself the very difficult burdens of responsibility of raising a child.<br />
<br />So they completely abandon those families, so when they start lecturing me or lecturing Democrats about life, we're going to remind them about their pathetic voting record - really an insulting voting record - when it comes to those important programs.<br />
<br />
<span>[Mr Casey is being completely dishonest. This is the mantra many liberals use and it is false. In reality the approach that pro-life politicians like Sen Santorum advocate, such as, utilizing ultrasound machines, waiting periods, involvement of boyfriend or husband and both sets of parents, information about post-abortion syndrome and pro-adoption counseling is the complete opposite of "abandoning mother and child". In addition the grass roots pro-life movement does not abandon mother and child. In virtually every part of the US there are abortion alternative centers that provide free counseling and free material and human resources to pregnant women. I have read that there are more pro-life help-giving centers (3000+ actually) than there are pro-life education and political action centers. And there are more abortion alternative centers in the US than there are abortion clinics. I have seen first-hand that these centers provide free prenatal care, free clothing, baby clothes, furnishings, and other help to women in need. Pro-life families often give free room and board as well as love and support to women in need. Pro-life doctors often volunteer no-cost medical help and pro-life lawyers donate legal aid to help with adoptions, when this is a woman's choice. Single mother support groups and childcare are offered. <strong>These efforts above directly support mother and child</strong>. Head Start, childcare, education, nutrition programs are helpful and continue to be considerably funded. Maybe not at the levels which Mr Casey and the Democrats would like to see, but they continue. To state otherwise is unfair and unsupported by the facts.]<br />
</span>
<br />And the final point I'd make is if someone wants to know the priorities that I will keep as United States Senator, I think they should look at my record as an Auditor General for eight years and state Treasurer for the last 15 months where I have made healthcare a principle focus of mine, even with limited power. And I'm going to use the opportunity I would have as United States Senator to focus on healthcare, because it has a lot to do not just with the life of the family or a business but also has a lot to do with whether Pennsylvanians can be competitive economically and whether we can develop the high-skilled jobs of the future.<br />
<br />So I think that's going to be my principle focus. The economy of Pennsylvania and, in a very substantial way, healthcare.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />Denny writes that this interview <strong>"clearly reveals that Casey's pro-life convictions are weak, inconsistent and ranking far lower in his priorities than is his unqualified support of anyone in the Democrat Party, including, obstensibly, the most adamant supporters of abortion. Note too his convenient indifference to abortion when it's dealt out in chemicals instead of curettes."<br />
</strong>
<br />I remember Mr Casey's father as leading a fight within the Democratic Party to protect the unborn. And he paid for leading that fight, politically and personally. Mr Casey, instead of continuing that fight within his party looks instead to not ruffling any feathers and attacking Republican pro-lifer efforts.<br />
<br />He sounds similarly like Sen Clinton and DNC Chairman Dean in recent remarks they made in calling for reducing abortion, but we know where really they stand on this issue. Is Mr Casey serious about his pro-life stance? Will he fight for pro-life legislation in a Democrat controlled Senate?<br />
<br />I believe Mr Casey missed an opportunity to stand up and state how he would fight to protect the unborn. Sorry, but increased funding for Head Start, childcare, public education and WIC are not going to be enough. Yes, the audience of MyDD is likely very pro-abortion but why not talk about why banning partial birth abortion and supporting parental notification are important to all Americans?<br />
<br />I just do not believe Mr Casey is serious about his pro-life stands. The MyDD interview is evidence of it, as is the absence of any serious mention of him being pro-life on his campaign web site. (I did find three news articles the site re-prints which do mention his stance, but the articles' focus his not on his pro-life position.) If he was serious his remarks in the interview would have been different and the issue section on his web site would at least mention his position.<br />
