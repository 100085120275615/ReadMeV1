Kennedy's New York City campaign manager in 1968, writes in an opinion piece published in the New York Post. <br /><li><strong>"And it started.

Hillary's cookies were baked by a friend's cook. <br /><li>"She is married to a fellow who believes that politics is all about turning enemies in to friends.

And yesterday, Hillary was back on TV on Today giving Katie Couric a tour of the white House Christmas decorations. The Horndog-in-Chief barely got a word in edgewise.

She has no ability to interact with people in a spontaneous way." </em>-- Camille Paglia <br /><li>"<em>However, it says something unflattering about our era that prominent political figures--who used to write declarations of independence, preambles to constitutions, Gettysburg addresses, and such--now use the alphabet only to make primitive artifacts, like the letter-inscribed tablet that Charlemagne is said to have put under his pillow each night, in the hope he'd wake up literate. Conservatives, including most of the Founding Fathers, have always worried that the price of a democratic system would be a mediocre nation. But George Washington and William F. Buckley Jr. put together could not have foreseen, in their gloomiest moments, the rise of Clinton-style ÃÂ¼ber-mediocrity--with its soaring commonplaces, its pumped trifling, its platinum-grade triviality. The Alpha-dork husband, the super-twerp wife, and the hyper-wonk vice president--together with all their mega-weenie water carriers, such as vicious pit gerbil George Stephanopoulos and Eastern diamondback rattleworm Sidney Blumenthal--spent eight years trying to make America nothing to brag about."</em> -- P.J O'Rourke on HRC's book <br /><li>"<em>Boring others is a form of aggression, and Hillary attacks her public with the weapon of brutal dullness."</em> -- P.J O'Rourke on HRC's book <br /><li>After listening to Jiang Zemin explain that the Tibetans had been liberated by the Chinese, Hillary concludes, <em>"I don't think Jiang . . . was being quite straight with me on Tibet." </em><br /><li>Babba Wawa: <em>"Ann, I bet you've never seen two women getting it on in public, have you?"</em><br />Ann Coulter: (about a six second pause) <em>"Actually, Barbara, I watched the Catie Couric/Hillary Clinton interview (also ABC) yesterday morning so, yes, I have seen two women getting it on in public." </em><br /><li>"We must stop thinking of the individual and start thinking about what is best for society." [Hillary Clinton, 1993]..... <br /><li>"Hillary Clinton, like her husband, both have said, 'We know what goes on in the White House, we've been there. We know how things work.' So I think it's very telling she assumes right off the bat that there is a cover up," -- said Cheri Jacobus. <br /><li>"Communist Party cadres should study the speeches of Hillary Clinton because she offers a very good example of the skills of propaganda. Her sentences are short and stimulating. That's why she gets a lot of applause. But Chinese people have a habit of giving long speeches in which the sentences are long and tedious." -- Yu Quanyu, director of the Chinese Academy of Social Studies, in Ideological and Political Work Studies. <br /><li>"In truth, Hillary is just one of a group of supremely powerful women, some of whom have learned to expertly play the victim card for their own benefit, others who peddle victimization and fear in order to influence you..." -- longtime Ladies Home Journal editor in chief Myrna Blyth <br /><li>Did you hear what the troops were calling the Sikorsky Blackhawk which Hillary used to tour Iraq?
