<div>As everyone knows by now, President Bush will be in office for another four years.
<br />
<br />This was probable but not entirely sure as I fell asleep for the final time this morning about 1:30ish pacific time - my state, Nevada, was still not a sure thing, nor was Ohio. 
<br />
<br />It's all over but the shouting - I'm enjoying breakfast here while waiting for John Kerry's (late!) concession speech.
<br />
<br />Meanwhile...
<br />
<br />Last night at the polls, I was talking to a very pretty young thing...
<br />
<br />Wait - John Kerry is on his way to Fanuil Hill in Boston for his concession speech - he did not look all that happy as he checked the sky just before scooting into the large, black Chevy Suburban to take him on his way.
<br />
<br />You have to feel sorry for him - he's just spent over two years of his life in this presidential campaign only to be walking away, wondering what history will think of him and what his legacy, if any, will be his from this...
<br />
<br />On the other hand, he's still married to Mrs John Kerry Heinz, the ketchup empire heiress - maybe large crocodile tears are in order. Yes, we know how competitive he is, but if he takes a larger perspective, he will still have a far better life than most people on the planet.
<br />
<br />On to the sweet young thing - she asked me who I was voting for...when I hesitated, she told me if she was eligible to vote, she would vote for Kerry.
<br />
<br />Fitting the demographic of both the young and the female as being the people most likely to vote for him...
<br />
<br />When I told her I was voting for Bush, she asked me why would we want four more years of the same thing - I told her the war in Iraq was necessary, Saddam Hussein is no longer in power, after a little more back and forth, I told her...
<br />
<br />This is the beauty of a democracy - we can disagree, go to the polls and vote, and by sometime tomorrow (it being election night when we spoke)we will know what the people of America had chosen.
<br />
<br />Her face brightened at this - when I went off to the polls to vote, she was watching me walk away when I turned to look back. 
<br />
<br />He who hesitates loses - I looked for her but did not see her when I left the polls...
<br />
<br />I had explained to her about how people always speak about 'big oil' as if it is this big, malevolent thing - when the entire world runs on petroleum, and asked for example, she did drive to the polls, did she not?
<br />
<br />I also told her, this is the last time Bush can run for President - even if he wins, he could not run again in 2008. 
<br />
<br />I then opined that would leave it open for Hillary Rodham Clinton to run...four more years of what had been my favorite presidency in the past 20 years, the wife of Slick Willie, Bill Clinton - I told her I figured that this is the reason Hillary Clinton is in political office in New York, a fact which otherwise makes little to no sense.
<br />
<br />So...you read it here first!
<br />
<br />
<strong>Hillary Rodham Clinton For President in 2008!</strong>
<br />
<br />Be Great!
