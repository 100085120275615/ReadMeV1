<div>The comments by DNC Chairperson Dr. Howard Dean again showed that a primal scream wasn't the only stupidity he could produce from his mouth. After his attack on Republicans ( and anything not democrat) it shows just how far the Democratic Party will go to win the next election. It is my belief that the entire reason he has been placed as the DNC Chair is to lend hope for others such as Nancy Pelosi of California and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York. As we are all familiar with both of the aforementioned ladies and others within the Democratic Party, we are all to aware of the fact that they play close to the left field foul line. However, Dean's recent actions lend the feeble minded to see the others as centrist in the Democratic Party. It is also my belief that Dr. Dean is being allowed enough rope to hang himself. As we are all watching him give his freak show it takes our focus off of others in the Democratic Party who have not changed their opinions or positions. It will be a sad day when Senator Pelosi's view of gun grabbing and taxation looks normal and when another Clinton in the White House looks better than a Dean spokesperson.<br />Email your comments to <a href="mailto:maddawgpobites@yahoo.com">maddawgpobites@yahoo.com</a>
