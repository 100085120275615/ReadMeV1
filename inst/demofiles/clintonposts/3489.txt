<div>Rasmussen is reporting that Joseph Lieberman (46%) now has a good lead over Ned Lamont (41%). I think this is pretty good evidence of two things that proove the DailyKos crowd wrong on two things about the Democratic primary in Connecticut.<br />
<br />1. It was not "people-powered" politics. People-powered politics suggests that the people as a whole voted for Lamont or against Lieberman. When polled, the people of Connecticut are saying 46 to 41 that they want Lieberman.<br />2. Ned Lamont is not in agreement with the bulk of the American people as DailyKos et. al. continuously says.<br />
<br />Here are what the facts really are in the above topics:<br />1. This was "foil-powered" politics that gave Lamont the Democratic nomination. It was the left wing moonbats in the self described "netroots" movement that voted for Lamont.<br />2. If you look at the poll you have a total of 52% against Lamont (after combining Lieberman's support with the Republican candidate). And the same applies to the DailyKos crowd. 52% of Connecticut do not see the issues the way DailyKos et. al. do. 52% of Connecticut sees the War on Terrorism and the war in Iraq differently from how Michael Moore, Cindy Shehan, and DailyKos see these issues.<br />
<br />Wake up moonbats. You're going to loose.<br />
