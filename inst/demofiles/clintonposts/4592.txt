<blockquote><br />
Last year, 16-year-old Starchild Abraham Cherrix, who goes by Abraham, went through three months of chemotherapy. Diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease, the teen from Virginia learned in February his cancer had returned despite the previous treatment. Having heard this, Abraham, with the support of his parents, decided to forego traditional treatment and instead decided to treat his cancer with an herbal diet under the guidance of a clinic in Mexico.</p>

<p>After his decision, a social worker intervened and brought Abraham's case to court. The judge ruled that Abraham's parents were being neglectful in allowing him, a minor in the United States, to refuse treatment. The judge also ordered Abraham's parents to share custody of their son with the local department of social services.<br />

<p>His parents offer a chilling warning to parents everywhere:<br />
<blockquote><br />
I want to caution all parents of Virginia: Look out, because Social Services may be pounding on your door next when they disagree with the decision you've made about the health care of your child.<br />

Hillary may get her health care wishes yet!</p>
