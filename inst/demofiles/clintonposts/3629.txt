<div>The national anthem in Spanish sucks.  I mean, the national anthem in English pretty much sucks -- some pedestrian lyrics set to the hard-to-sing tune of a British drinking song -- but boy, howdy, does that version in Spanish really, really suck.  The singing is horrible.  Roseanne Barr sang the thing better than these people.  By all means, translate the damned thing into any language you want, translate the thing into Klingon if you want, but please, please, dear Jesus please, get somebody to sing it who can actually sing.  Because this version sucks.  It's like hearing every bad national anthem sung before a high school football game for the last 100 years rolled into one.  Not cool.<br />
<br />The "Nights with Alice Cooper" radio show sucks.  I didn't think anything could make Clear Channel-era "classic" rock radio any worse, but Alice took the challenge and won.  He's a horrible radio personality who rambles worse than Michael Savage and Randi Rhodes combined.  Listening to Alice talk on the radio is like listening to the old men who sit out in front of Wal-Mart talk -- incoherent and pointless.  Alice, you only had one decent album ("Welcome to My Nightmare"), and all you've done for 10 years is play celebrity golf tournaments.  You suck.  And by the way, when did Def Leppard become "classic" rock?  When did Def Leppard even qualify as rock music at all?<br />
<br />Hillary Clinton sucks.  She's trying so hard to be a moderate for 2008 that she's lost all sense of direction and purpose.  She supports both amnesty for illegal aliens AND a new Berlin wall between America and Mexico.  She's pro-choice, unless that choice is to play video games with fucking and wanton violence in them.  I'd vote for John McCain before I'd vote for Hillary, and he's turned into an ass-kissing Bush toady.  Hanging out with Newt Gingrich proved it, Hillary -- you suck.<br />
<br />George Clooney sucks.  George, I know you mean well, but your celebrity whining is the kiss of death to whatever political ideal it touches.  You're a liberal, and you're happy to be out of touch.  Good for you.  But the American people won't take political advice from any cast member of "The Facts of Life," not even Tootie.  Go away.  You suck.<br />
<br />"The Da Vinci Code" sucks.  "The Gospel of Judas," likewise.  As a matter of fact, Christianity in every guise sucks, even with Tom Hanks in the main role.  Dan Brown is the worst best-selling author since that "Bridges of Madison County" guy.<br />
<br />The people who thought May 1 would be a good day for an immigrant strike suck.  Don't you idiots know that May 1 is traditionally the day when socialists, anarchists, and other anti-capitalist people hold ineffectual and generally derided protests?  You wanted to be associated with THOSE people?  I thought you were all here to take advantage of capitalism at its finest -- May 1 might be considered a "worker's day" by some, but it was Vladimir Lenin who came up with that idea.  There's only three colors that scare the average American -- black, red, and brown.  You're already brown.  Don't be associated with the reds.<br />
<br />Republicans suck.  You guys are about to piss off your second large minority group in 50 years.  You got lucky with the black people -- they don't vote in large numbers.  Will you get so lucky with hispanics?  I mean, most hispanics come from predominantly Catholic countries -- they're likely to be anti-abortion and anti-gay, two subjects you've used successfully to win elections in the past.  Cubans in Florida are STILL voting Republican because they're pissed at John Kennedy.  This was a voting bloc with massive conservative potential, and you're kicking them to the curb.  Just remember:  each kid these folks have on US soil is a future eligible voter.  It's like you're TRYING to turn Texas blue.<br />
<br />Democrats suck.  The Democratic establishment is just as pro-white and racist as the Republican establishment, but they're better at exploiting minorities.  There's a lot of future Democrat mealy-mouthed dickheads who are going to make it into office based on this.  They won't, of course, make life better for anybody but their white selves, but hey, votes is votes.  Go to hell, Democrats, you suck.<br />
<br />Nancy Grace sucks.  I never knew there was a talking head who sucked worse than Bill O'Reilly before I watched Nancy.  I don't have cable, so it's only been recently that I've discovered Nancy -- we keep a television on at work.  We don't give a shit what happened to Natalee Holloway, Nancy, and your accent is grating to anybody from the South who listens to you.  It's Nancy, Bill, or Paula Zahn.  What kind of choice is that?  I thought this was capitalist America, dammit!  I want choices, not crap!  Thank God for ESPN.<br />
<br />Things that don't suck?  Having a beer and a cigarette on a Monday night with two days off from work, having a wife who hugs you tight and tells you she loves you before going to bed, looking up at you with the same green eyes that made you fall in love with her 12 years ago, fat kitties who curl up and rumble and purr in your lap while you type, "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock," and the movie "Secretary."<br />
<br />Everything else?  American dumbshow.<br />
<br />Cheers.</div>
