<br />On Wednesday,10-18-05,Liz Anderson (696-8538) of the Journal News e-mailed me that she wanted to talk to me about the proposals Bill Ryan (chairman of the Westchester County Board of Legislators) was soliciting about restricting what people (me) can say when they (me) address the County Legislators AND how they (me) say it.<br />Anyhow we eventually did speak. As the larger part of the interview,I read her a statement<br />that I prepared. And it is as follows:<br />" I'm nearly 57 and a disabled old man at that. When I speak at the Board of Legislators meetings, I try to tell the truth - and I need to sing so I can communicate that truth to women and young people.<br />From your e-mail I assume that my friend Bill Ryan,the chairman of the Board,wants to restrict<br />what can be said as well as how it can be said. He wants to take the joy out of life. Therefor,I'm<br />probably going to be forced to sue him in Federal Court. But that will also be a branch of my<br />other lawsuits putting the judiciary on trial.<br />You see,I like to sing as well as speak and singing is a part of my speaking. Indeed,singing<br />runs in my family. Dennis Day,the famous Irish tenor,TV and movie star was a very  close<br />cousin. His mother was my grandfather's sister,also a Courtney.<br />This is also like deja vue because 25 years ago,they changed the rules for speaking before the<br />Yonkers City Council because of the way I spoke.<br />You see,I think that more than a few laws and rules must be scaled back in order to save us<br />all. The world may not survive beyond the next 5 years unless we change.<br />I'm an old man so it does not too much affect me. But for my boys,my brothers and sisters<br />children - indeed all children- it makes a big difference. AND the fact that there is not enough money in social security and in our retirement plans to pay us when we retire does concern<br />me.<br />We're all going to die some day and most people are uneasy thinking about that. But it does<br />bother me like that because I was dead-I lay  in a coma for 40 days- when I was 13,and I<br />have some idea of what its like to be dead.<br />You see when I woke up from my coma to find I was completely paralysed,I  also found that I<br />have what might be termed "second sight" - and I do see the future. And its not a very long<br />one for the human race if we keep going as we are."<br />Liz also asked me what I thought about Andrea Stewart Cousin's objection to what I said<br />about feminism and some Mr. Maisano's objection to my observation that County Executive Andy Spano most likely a recipient of money from organized crime figures -and that Mulino's might be the place where the money was exchanged and deals made.<br />Now I like Andrea,but,as I told Liz,Feminism has got to go (and its exponants like Hillary<br />and Bill Clinton; Bill is only such a supporter because he can get more Monica Lewinskyies -<br />and he has a new lease on life since he discovered the wonderful restorative powers of<br />viagra).<br />As for the objection that Andy gets money from organized crime,if he is too stupid to<br />realize where his money comes from,that is not my fault.<br />Furthermore,the owner of Mulinos,Louie Gigante,was probably one of my classmates at<br />St. Barnabas Grammer School in the Bronx. And the fact that his restaurant was the place<br />for payoffs to be made and deals to be done does not mean that he had anything to do with<br />it.<br />
<br />2)Today (10-20-05) I appeared in Yonkers Criminal Court on the case that got me thrown<br />into jail for singing the National Anthem BECAUSE City Council Pres. Richard Martinelli<br />REFUSED  to let me speak (see below) and not,as my old friend Anthony (publisher of<br />yonkerscitizen.com) reported, WHILE I WAS AT THE MICROPHONE  (see below -and<br />realize that I am a well-trained singer).<br />Anyhow,I remembered the Judge well from when I used to practice law in Yonkers. Of course<br />he didn't recognize me because I had a pair of shorts on (I wanted the Judge to take note of<br />the difficulty I have walking  as well as how much my legs are bent out of shape because of<br />Richard Martinelli's petty and tyranical act of throwing me in jail for singing the National<br />Anthem- see below) and my head is completely(shaved) bald.<br />Anyhow,my lawyer,Mr.Nader(Legal Aid;for I am a pauper thanks to the NYS Judiciary),at<br />first wanted to have the case called so he could be relieved because,as he told the Judge,<br />there was a failure of communication between he and I. And yet,after what later transpired<br />(see below),maybe he forgot to again ask the Judge to relieve him - or he changed his mind.<br />You see all of us -we who are lawyers- are aspiring actors. And we love the dramatic and<br />noble gesture and personality; as a matter of fact,I like Mr. Nader.<br />Anyhow,when we got up before the Judge,Mr.Nader,the ADA,the Judge and I were all talking<br />at once (most unlawyerlike,of course). Eventually I prevailed upon the Judge to allow me to address the Court (after Mr.Nader disavowed any knowledge of what I was going to say;but I<br />had three copies of my  supporting process which I proceded to hand out to the judge,the ADA<br />and Mr. Nader [the Judge and the ADA refused to accept the papers but I left their copies with<br />a Court Officer,a Mr. Graham (with instructions that they were for the Judge and the ADA) so it can be argued that they have been constructively served; you see,this is why we lawyers hate process -papers mean something to us]). And I addressed the Court,as follows (I will indicate the point I got to read to and continue with my full statement afterwards):<br />"I am here to admit that I sang the National Anthem at a PUBLIC HEARING  of the Yonkers City Council.<br />However,the reason I did so can be analogized to a case of self-defense - more precisely,defense<br />of my constitutional right to speak at public hearings. And,thereby,I was also upholding the<br />Constitution and laws of the USA and NYS - unlike petty and tyrannical Richard Martinelli.<br />In actual fact,I sang the National Anthem at that PUBLIC HEARING BECAUSE Richard<br />Martinelli REFUSED to allow me to  speak in violation of my constitutionally protected First<br />Amendment right to speak freely. (at this point the judge would listen no more,but I will<br />add the rest of my planned statement below)<br />In truth,Richard Martinelli broke the law first by refusing to let me speak at public meetings<br />for the 6 MONTHS preceeding the day I sang the National Anthem.<br />So my behavior was provoked by the prior illegal behavior of Richard Martinelli and is<br />thereby analogous to entrapment.<br />Moreover I ask your Honor to take judicial notice of the fact that I am barely able to walk,<br />thanks to Richard Martinelli's illegal action of throwing me in jail and forcing me to sleep on what they call beds but which are in fact torture racks which exacerbated my spinal and leg injuries.<br />In addition,I am 56 years old,so any claim of resisting arresting arrest is a patent impossibility.<br />As for the $200.00,I am a pauper thanks to the foresight-lacking NYS Judiciary. And here I<br />give your honor informational material on this matter (here is when I planned to give the<br />Judge,the ADA and my lawyer the informational process which I noted above; it was merely a<br />status report on my two cases,against the NYS Judiciary and Richard Martinelli/City of Yonkers in Federal Court and this case and is #1 in the supplementary papers that go to those on my email list).<br />So I can not pay your $200.00 fine - nor do I think I should. For I did nothing wrong. What I<br />did was unusual,I admit. But it was not wrong.<br />Therefor I suggest that you fine Richard Martinelli or the NYS Judiciary in accordance with the informational papers I gave you (In point of fact,I offered the papers/process,they refused<br />and I left them with Court Officer Graham for the Judge and the ADA -who,by the way,was<br />highly incensed that I made a mockery of the law ON THIS PARTICULAR CASE)...<br />(And I intended to add,just as I was leaving the Bench:) Please consider these informational<br />documents process in the noted lawsuits against Richard Martinelli,the City of Yonkers and<br />the NYS Judiciary.<br />To my email recipients,I am adding the case status report that I left for the Judge,the ADA<br />and with my lawyer,Mr.Nader (#1), I am adding the article by Anthony (publisher of yonkers- citizen.com) about Liz Anderson's article about me in the Journal News (#4),comments after<br />this article (#2a-f) and comments after another of my comments on the Tony Castro-Janet DeFiore race for D.A. in Westchester County(#3a-c)</div>
