<p>I was doing a roundup of websites for 2008 Presidential candidates and I came across <a href="http://www.blogsforbayh.com/">Blogs for Bayh </a>(which seems unused), <a href="http://blogsforhillary.blogspot.com/">Blogs for Hillary</a>, <a href="http://condoleezza.blogspot.com/">Blogs for Condi </a>and <a href="http://blogsforrudi.com/">Blogs for Rudi</a>.  This makes me bet that just about every possible candidate for 2008 either has an active "blogs for" or someone has reserved such a name for use in 2008.  </p>

<p>There's nothing like using what works, right?  We here at Blogs for Bush have had an enormous amount of fun doing this, and we are delighted that others have decided to follow our lead.  </p>

<p>It is in our little communities were the real life of this nation takes place - the "blogs for" communities are just more of what Burke terms our "little platoons" where average people gather to obtain information, discuss events and decide on courses of action.  The modern world has added the blogosphere to our families, churches and clubs which have been the real mainstays of liberty in our society.</p>
