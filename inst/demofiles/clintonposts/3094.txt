<div>Good evening, my sensuous librarians~<br />
<br />I am very happy to announce, along with the rest of the 'liberal media' that the FDA finally had some cajones and has approved the morning after pill for distribution over-the-counter to women 18 and over. The F.D.A.âs approval was not unexpected, but the way the government has been running things lately? I am personally amazed the anti-abortionists and (other under-educated people who don't understand the difference between a couple of cells and a fetus or a baby) lost on this one.  Of course the FDA did the right thing. <br />
<br />As reported by the New York Times, here are some of our representatives who commented:<br />
<br />
<em>âThis long overdue decision is a victory for womenâs health and for the American people who have been waiting for years for the F.D.A. to act,â Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Patty Murray of Washington, both Democrats, said in a joint statement. The two also held a press conference.</em>
<br />
<br />Good for them. Those ladies stood up for what was right and common sense prevailed.<br />
<br />I am proud to say that America might even be a safer place for women and children in the future.  Less unwanted, unplanned pregnancies certainly result in less neglect and abuse of children and may also diminish the rampant domestic violence being perpetrated on dependent women and children by others.<br />
<br />My one grinding complaint?  Why do the equivalent of perhaps five birth control pills cost more than a month's supply?  This is what is wrong with the pharmaceutical industry.  They exploit the desperate by charging enormous amounts of money to cancer patients and now young, underpaid or indigent or can't-afford-a-kid young women?  $40 a pop?  That is highway robbery, but at least the Feds are letting women buy it.  <br />
<br />Oh.  Men can buy it too, so if a woman is too ashamed, or whatever, he can pick up her prescription or buy his own over the counter.  I guess somebody thought that one out.  Let's hope that is not an abused power.  No, I don't even want to think about forced pill-taking.  I can't.  Let's just let it be a good day and a victory for women, children and common sense.<br />
