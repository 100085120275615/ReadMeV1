<p>A New York Sun editorial waxes righteous (for the elect); Hinchey talks deregulation; and should NYRI opponents take it to the streets?<br />

<ins><img align="right" hspace="10" src="http://static.flickr.com/60/192463830_d3025d2771_m.jpg" alt="antinyri" /></ins>The New York Sun, with furrowed brow, last week ran an <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/38038">editorial</a> calling on Schumer, Hillary, Eliot and the gang to start standing up more for New York City&#8217;s power needs.  The tone and content of the column offers an interesting insight into the complacent worldview of those accustomed to power and influence.  It acknowledges that &#8220;quite the fury&#8221; has erupted about NYRI, but actual upstate people remain curiously unmentioned in the column.   It isn&#8217;t even clear, from the column, where the fury is coming from exactly.  The fury, presumably, is not really a fury, but just an annoying bottleneck.   </p>
	<p>There appears to be no way to directly respond to the editorial; again, interesting insight into the worldview.</p>
	<p>At <a href="http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060818/NEWS/608180332/-1/NEWS">last week&#8217;s public forum</a> in Ferndale, Sullivan County, there was much fury in evidence, and some new kinds of public statements from politicians.</p>
	<blockquote><p>Paul Tonko, D-Amsterdam, who chairs the Assembly&#8217;s Energy Committee, said New York should be able to find other ways to solve its power problems, so a giant transmission line shouldn&#8217;t be shoved down its throat. The committee sponsored the first of several of these meetings planned along the route. &#8220;Why should we not be able to control our own destiny?&#8221; Tonko said.</p>
	<p>His concerns were echoed by U.S. Rep Maurice Hinchey, D-Hurley, who vowed to fight NYRI if it came to Washington. The line is just a symptom of broader electricity deregulation, Hinchey said, and of industry lobbyists gaining too much say over the process.  &#8220;The goal is to take this system and make more money,&#8221; Hinchey said. &#8220;Nothing else is of concern.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
	<p>(Albany to Paul Tonko:  &#8220;What&#8217;s this &#8216;we&#8217; stuff?&#8221;)</p>
	<p><a href="http://www.stopthepowerlines.com">Stopthepowerlines.com</a> has the <a href="http://www.stopthepowerlines.com/?p=153">full text of Hinchey&#8217;s statement</a>, which is dissection of deregulation and its effects.  </p>
	<blockquote><p>I find it quite ironic that many of the Republican state and federal representatives who voted for such policies or allowed them to take place at their respective levels of government are now announcing their opposition to the NYRI project. And while I appreciate everyone&#8217;s opposition at this time, proposals, such as that submitted by NYRI, are an inevitable and predictable outcome of the market-driven deregulation that some of these same political leaders supported and promoted. New York State&#8217;s deregulation process was touted as a means of fostering competition and consumer choice and lowering electricity rates, but this has not been the result, as evidenced by the increased total rates of electricity service and the continued lack of meaningful customer choice.</p>
	<p>Additionally, federal energy policies which promoted so called &#8220;marketplace solutions&#8221; to our energy needs, also did not protect the public interest in the generation and distribution of electricity. As we have seen nationally, the drive towards deregulation and market control of our electric system has led to a less reliable and less stable system that fails to address critical public needs, including consumer protection for residents and businesses, environmental conservation, protection of local community interests and investments in much-needed infrastructure improvements. </p></blockquote>
	<p>(Rhetoric watch:  Hinchey interestingly refers to &#8220;lower New York State&#8221; repeatedly instead of the perhaps more emotionally charged &#8220;downstate.&#8221;  Maybe a good idea.)</p>
	<p>It would be interesting if the many groups involved in NYRI could organize a 200-mile walk or bike ride along the proposed line route, or a &#8220;march&#8221; if you will, before the weather gets too cold.  Or better yet, two 100-mile marches starting from both ends, and meeting in the middle, to symbolize a <i>real</i> interconnection of New Yorkers, not the cruel fakery of NYRI&#8217;s acronym.  It could serve a few good purposes &#8212; obviously, publicity being the first, and more public pressure on wavering NY politicians being the second.  But I think it would also be good for people to be invited to get a good, close look at all that beauty, and to see and experience the small towns before they would be changed.   (Especially since NYRI has been supplying questionable photographs; invite people to take their own.)   I wonder if the anti-NYRI movement has become &#8220;meetinged out&#8221; somewhat.  The recent FERC proclamation about New York being designated a &#8220;national corridor&#8221; seems to demand a strong new response, ideally one that would serve several purposes at once.</p>
	<p>I&#8217;m not sure what will happen with NYRI in the end &#8212; but it&#8217;s clear that this sort of crap is not likely to stop in the future elsewhere, unless people see the beauty, feel the hurt, and remember them for next time.   </p>
