<div>Rod Dreher has been more visable in the run up to the release of his book. Now that he is saying what he really believes others are coming to realize what I've been saying all along....Dreher is a TrendyCon.<br />
<br />Jonah Goldberg is finally on the case <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_01_01_corner-archive.asp#085727">here</a>. Of course Dreher had to start quoting Hillary Clinton to tip the scales against him. Who knows, maybe 2006 will also be the year that Goldberg ends his love affair with Andrew Sullivan as well.</div>
