First, via Miss Vicky,  this excellent mash up video of our Dear Leader singing "Imagine" and "Take a Walk on the Wild Side" Having W. sing "Imagine" is becoming its own little genre. This version is much better than the previous one I saw. Less dogmatic, more odd. And what's with all the Hillary footage?<br /><br />Second, via <a href="http://www.unfogged.com/archives/week_2006_08_20.html#005362">Lizardbreath at Unfogged</a>, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/27/books/Letters.t-5.html?_r=2&adxnnl=1&oref=slogin&adxnnlx=1156608697-V9NI+xVVHJmkr2dlaLGWuA">this letter</a> to the NYT book review. <blockquote>To the Editor:<br /><br />Reading Dexter Filkinsâs review of âThe Looming Tower,â by Lawrence Wright (Aug. 6), I was both concerned and outraged to learn that the âcave-dwelling madmanâ Osama bin Laden is, in fact, only six feet tall. Since the horrific attacks of Sept. 11 I have naturally assumed, like many Americans, that bin Laden was 6-foot-6 if not taller. This shocking revelation has forced me to radically reassess my views on 9/11, the war on terror, the Bush administration, the liberation of Iraq, and Islam, which is caught between the rock of tradition and the hard place of modernity. No longer do I consider bin Laden to be an invincible Goliath-like demagogue. Now that I know his true stature, I think we should move on to pressing domestic concerns.<br /><br />Lt. Col.
