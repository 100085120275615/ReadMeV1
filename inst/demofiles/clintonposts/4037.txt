<p>I hope everyone had a good Martin Luther King Jr. Day on Monday. I know Hillary did. She had a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,181836,00.html">busy day</a> at the Canaan Baptist Church of Christ in Harlem where she attended an event hosted by the slightly kooky (but loveable) Reverend Al Sharpton. This is an event that takes place every year on MLK day, and every year white politicians flock to it while on the campaign trail to convince black voters that they really, honestly care about their struggles rather than just, you know&#8230;keeping their votes.</p>
<p>So how do &#8220;smart&#8221; liberal politicians like Hillary Clinton try and keep the black vote on her (his?) side? By a tried and true formula of course! Take your opponents, and <em>compare them to slave owners</em>! When asked what the basic difference between modern Democrats and Republicans are, Hillary replied:</p>
<p><strong>&#8220;When you look at the way the House of Representatives has been run, it has been run like a plantation and you know what I&#8217;m talking about. It has been run in a way so that nobody with a contrary view has had a chance to present legislation, to make an argument, to be heard.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Abbwuh? A <em>plantation</em>? Oh, I get it. The Republicans are like the rich, white plantation owners and the Democrats are like the lowly black slaves who are ripped from their families, stuffed onto ships, forced into hard labor for no pay, and beaten on regular basis. See black people? Hillary&#8217;s on <strong>your</strong> side! She&#8217;s a slave too!</p>
<p>Nice try, Hil. But your analogy is ridiculous and anyone with a shred of common sense or who doesn&#8217;t teach political science at Hofstra University can probably see through your tactics without much effort. You&#8217;re in a black church, on <strong>Martin Luther King Day</strong>, and you&#8217;re pulling the race card out of your sweet ass. I&#8217;m telling you, it&#8217;s the <strong>same</strong> trick pulled time and time again by Democrats. Must I go over this again? All these people ever seem to do is compare their opponents to one of the following: Hitler, Pol Pot, McCarthy, Stalin, Slave Owners, Nixon, or Darth Vader. Jot those down, or make up a song or something so you can remember them all. This is one of the first things you need to know when you run for office as a Democrat.</p>
<p>I hope I don&#8217;t have to spell out how absurd it is for a white chick from Chicago to stroll into a a Harlem church and essentially say, &#8220;Yeah guys! The Republicans are treating us all like <strong>SLAVE MASTERS</strong>. Vote &#8216;fer me!&#8221; This is ridiculous in two ways:</p>
<p>#1. It wrongly compares primarily decent human beings to <strong>MEN WHO ENSLAVED BLACK PEOPLE.</strong></p>
<p>#2. It belittles the horrendous nature of what actually happened at plantations in the early days of this country. Because, as you may know, these plantations were run by <strong>MEN WHO ENSLAVED BLACK PEOPLE.</strong></p>
<p>The only reason Hillary said the word &#8220;plantation&#8221; was because she was in a black church on Martin Luther King Day. She wanted everyone to think, &#8220;Hey! It&#8217;s me, H-Dawg! I&#8217;m on your side dudes! I <em>identify</em> with you!&#8221; If she had been at a synagogue during Hanukkah, she probably would have said, <strong>&#8220;The House has been run like a CONCENTRATION CAMP and you know what I&#8217;m talking about.&#8221; </strong>If she had been at an elementary school, she probably would have said, <strong>&#8220;The House has been run like the PRINCIPAL&#8217;S OFFICE or the TIME-OUT CHAIR and you know what I&#8217;m talking about, kids.&#8221;</strong></p>
<p>Give it a rest, Hillary. If you want to honor MLK, do it the right way. Don&#8217;t use <strong>SLAVERY</strong> as a political tool to try and wrangle some more votes. It&#8217;s a pathetic tactic.</p>
