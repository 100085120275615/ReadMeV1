<div>Is it my imagination, or have there been an increasing number of attacks on free speech recently in New York City, my home and a place I like to think of as a relatively tolerant and sophisticated place?:<br />
<br />1) A couple of weeks ago, the Jonathan Tasini for Senate campaign was informed Tasini would not be allowed to debate Hillary Clinton on the local station New York 1, because Tasini hadn't raised $500,000. Never mind that Tasini qualified for the ballot with 40,000 petition signatures  (mostly collected by volunteers) or that, despite no advertising, he was polling at 13 percent against celebrity candidate Clinton (and most likely is even more popular now). Apparently what counts is how much money you raise. Is this democracy? The most disturbing aspect of this story is that Time Warner, which owns New York 1, is a campaign contributor to Clinton. Obviously, this is all part of a strategy of currying favor with the likely winner, as part of  business lobbying.<br />
<br />2)Next, blogger Raed Jarrar was accosted at JFK airport in New York for wearing a t-shirt with Arabic writing on it. I find this ludicrous. Would a terrorist walk around with a t-shirt with Arabic writing on it in an airport? The security officials defended themselves by saying that they couldn't be sure what the t-shirt said because they didn't read Arabic. I actually find it disturbing that no one who works security at JFK can read Arabic. I'm not sure whether this incident is more upsetting because of the attack on free speech, the racial discrimination, or the incompetence of airport security.<br />
<br />3)Lastly, a man in Staten Island was arrested for selling satellite tv packages that included Al Manar, Hezbollah's tv station. Supposedly this constituted "material support for terrorism." I do not think this case will stand up in court, but it's disturbing it is being prosecuted. Maybe the man has to pay Hezbollah some type of money to sell these packages? I'm not sure...I do not get satellite tv. But I'm not sure this is even relevant, because Al Manar does not, itself, conduct terrorist operations. In fact I do not even consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization, although the U.S. State Department disagrees with me. Why should we consider Hezbollah a terrorist organization when its activities have been targeted at getting Israel to leave Lebanon? Israel attacked and invaded Lebanon, first in 1982, now again in 2006. Although I disagree with some of Hezbollah's tactics, I also disagree with some of the U.S. military's tactics, such as the use of cluster bombs. Our "terrorism" labels are increasingly cases of the pot calling the kettle black.<br />
<br />Why shouldn't people have a chance to view Al Manar for themselves, and make up their own minds? Or is that exactly what the U.S. government is so afraid of--not the possibility of Al Manar making a profit for Hezbollah?</div>
