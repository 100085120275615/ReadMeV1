<div><p>So the media is big in horse race coverage, and conflict, and mud-slinging, and the endless back and forth, and the issues get ignored, and yes, it's all true, but for now, pretend we don't care.</p>

<p>You might want to know, who will get elected President in the fall of 2008?</p>

<p>Let me begin answering that question, by getting to work on another: Has John McCain peaked way too early, or is he really such a juggernaut? <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/story/2005/11/23/153637/12">Matt Yglesias</a> handicaps McCain's chances thusly:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><span>. . . Under the current circumstances, it's very much in the interests of the Democratic Party and many liberal institutions to play up their points of agreement with the Senator. It's also in the interests of the White House to try and stay more-or-less on his good side. And McCain has always been adored by the press. As a result, he's very popular: People only hear good things about him.<br /><br />. . . . McCain has also pulled off the neat trick of alienating cultural conservative leaders <em>without</em> making any substantive concessions to cultural liberals. I know his polling looks good now, but I think if he somehow manages to get the nomination he'll fare much worse than people expect. On the other hand, my track record of political prognostication is pretty bad.</span></p></blockquote><p dir="ltr"><span>McCain's poll numbers, as shown in recent <em>Hotline</em> poll, are impressive. What is unclear is what poll respondents actually know about him. Are his numbers solid, or are they more akin to Joe Lieberman's numbers in 2002 and 2003? One response to those numbers, for Democrats, is to act as though if he wins the nomination, 2008 is hopeless. I don't think that's true, but either way, "if he wins the nomination" is a big if in John McCain's case. The Republican primary voters sent him home once before, and they might again. Will George Allen's Southern Conservative Good Ole Boy vibe remind voters of George Bush? Will Brownback pick up steam with the right-wing base? If McCain is able to beat them, what will he be forced to reveal to "swing voters" in the process?</span></p>

<p dir="ltr">But back to Matt's point, which is perhaps more interesting, and one that I agree with. John McCain has pulled an amazing trick, and finds himself in an environment inverted from Hillary Clinton's. Where she is a somewhat moderate Democrat who is viewed as quite liberal, McCain is quite conservative and viewed as a moderate. Moreover, the way that he lost to George Bush in 2000 plays up this idea. He carried New Hampshire decisively and did well in Michigan. But, he lost South Carolina, and was beaten there by ugly means. This helped to ingratiate him to the media, as well as win him character points with many political observers. McCain's character goes generally unquestioned. This won't be the case in a campaign. Moreover, he simply isn't as moderate as people expect. He makes good noises on campaign finance reform, tax-loophole closing, and the environment (relatively speaking). But many of his "maverick" positions are more in tone than in effect. For example, he talks of balancing the budget. Which Bush tax cuts will he repeal? He has not always parroted Bush's language on Iraq, but where (until his recent torture bill) has he split from the administration on policy?</p>

<p dir="ltr">Will people like what they see, when McCain is on television every day? Can his image be sustained for another three years? Does he have anywhere to go but down? One thing is for sure, the media loves competition. The press will give ample time to any of McCain's rivals who attack him. Or has he truly hit a critical mass of support and good will?</p>

<p dir="ltr">I'll be watching closely a few issues in particular. First, how does McCain deal with abortion? As mentioned earlier today, it will, in some form or another come before the Court. How loudly will he play to the Republican base? Next is immigration. This is shaping up to be a big issue in 2006 and 2008. How hard-line will he get? Third, on the budget, will he make compromises, or run on more irresponsible tax cuts, perhaps this time coupled with more service cuts as well? Fourth, on Iraq, will he put on his partisan rose-colored glasses or get serious? His primary audience probably won't want to hear about how badly George Bush screwed up, but the general election voters will be hungry for a new solution.</p>

<p dir="ltr">McCain's definitely riding high right now, but will he stand up to scrutiny or fold?</p>

<p dir="ltr">By the way, Matt referenced <a href="http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2005/11/mccain_2008_hyp.html">Brian Nyhan</a> in the post that I quoted. His blog is a solid read as well.</p></div>
