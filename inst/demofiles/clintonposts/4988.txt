<span><strong><span>The following is a description of a revealing book by Lt. Col. Robert Patterson, an</span></strong><strong><span> officer entrusted with our nation's nuclear codes under President Clinton. In it, Col. Patterson tells why he felt compelled to expose Bill Clinton as a derelict president who cared little for national security and one who put every American in mortal danger.</span></strong></span><br /><span><span><strong><span></span></strong><br /></span><strong><span>Dereliction of Duty</span></strong></span><br /><strong><span>by Lt. Col. Robert Patterson </span></strong><br /><strong><span></span></strong><br /><span>When he was tapped to accompany President Clinton and carry the nuclear "football" that contains the top-secret codes the President needs in case of nuclear war, Lieutenant Colonel Robert "Buzz" Patterson was proud and grateful. He had already put his life on the line for his country many times as he flew combat missions over the Persian Gulf and Bosnia, and he was honored to take on this new and awesome responsibility. </span><br /><br /><span>But when he entered the Clinton White House, his gratitude and awe soon gave way to shock, revulsion, and sorrow - as he saw first-hand the cavalier and self-serving way Slick Willie and his henchmen went about the business of running the country. In <strong><em>Dereliction of Duty: An Eyewitness Account of How Bill Clinton Compromised America's National Security</em>,</strong> Patterson tells the whole story. Day in and day out in the Clinton White House, he witnessed the President's contempt for the military, his indifference to important issues except insofar as they served his own political or personal purposes, and his reduction of the Office of the Presidency to a playground for his own ambition and thirst for sordid perks. </span><br /><br /><span>Patterson not only had numerous opportunities to see Clinton's irresponsibility and neglect of his duties: he also witnessed Hillary's furious, profane rages and relentless shifting of blame to subordinates; the general disdain of Clinton staffers toward the military; and much more. The Clinton White House more closely resembled a college fraternity house than the seat of government of the most powerful nation on earth - and it all led, Patterson argues compellingly, to our armed forces and intelligence services falling into such a demoralized, unprepared state that a disaster was just waiting to happen. That disaster happened on September 11, 2001. </span><br /><br /><strong><span>Do you think you have heard it all about Clinton? Think again.

"And I know," explains Patterson, "that the greater good was demonstrably <em>not </em>served by President Clinton and his administration, which put personal wants and needs ahead of the national interest." That makes this book more important than just a record of Clinton's misdeeds: it is essential reading for every patriot who wants to do his part to prevent such a debased character from ever occupying the Oval Office again.</span><br /><br />For the full story, be sure to read Lt. Col. Patterson's book. It is a shocking story and one you won't find in <em>The New York Times</em> or any other mainstream media news source.<br /><br />
