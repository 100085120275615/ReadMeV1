<strong>Hillary's Largest Campaign Contributor Launches New Blog</strong>
</div>
<div align="center">
<strong></strong> </div>Since I came forward in March, 2001, to report campaign finance fraud by Hillary Clinton in her 2000 Senate campaign, the mainstream media continues to hide the facts, and the significance, of Hillary Clinton's role in directing the largest campaign finance fraud on record. This has been hidden in plain sight by the media even though it involves the first criminal prosecution of a U.S. Senator's finance director for election fraud, the use of Sen. Edward Kennedy's brother-in-law as an FBI informant who wore a wire to secretly record incriminating conversations with Hillary's finance director, and witnesses that include A-List Hollywood celebrities and media figures.<br />Because I witnessed, and inadvertently participated in, Hillary Clinton's deception of the voters of New York about my relationship with her in two blatantly false stories given to the Washington Post by Hillary's spokesman Howard Wolfson in August, 2000. Because I witnessed Hillary Clinton's role in filing three fraudulent reports with the Federal Election Commission and the U.S. Senate about my identity and how much I contributed to her campaign, I have been unavoidably thrust into the role of whistle blower and plaintiff in an historic civil suit against a President and Senator for fraud and conspiracy.<br />
