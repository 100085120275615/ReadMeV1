<div>Dear Friends,<br />
<br />It's a matter of simple fairness. Since 1997, members of Congress have refused to give minimum wage workers a raise - not one penny - while voting to give themselves more than $30,000 in raises.<br />
<br />Here's the bottom line: The minimum wage is just $5.15 an hour. That means that someone working a full-time job, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, earns just $10,712 a year. That's more than $5,000 below the poverty line for a family of three. And as the cost of living goes up, that $5.15 is worth less and less every day.<br />
<br />It's time to tell Congress "No more." Hillary has introduced a bill that would make sure Congress doesn't get another raise in their own pay until those making the minimum wage get a raise too. Stand with her by supporting her bill:<br />

<br />Why does this Republican Congress refuse to take action? We've seen where their priorities are: big, new tax breaks to the very wealthiest Americans. When it comes to helping working families, the Republican Congress can't be bothered.<br />
<br />Maybe this way, they'll finally take notice. Let's tell the Republican Congress that they're not getting another raise until America gets a raise. Tell Hillary you're standing with her.<br />

<br />There are millions of people in this country who are working hard but can't make enough to get by. With minimum wage earners making the same money they did nine years ago, wages across the board have stayed stagnant. With health care costs and housing and energy prices on the rise, middle class families are working harder than ever and still can't get ahead.<br />
<br />Let's get the Republicans in Congress moving. Let Hillary know you support her bill that ties all future Congressional raises to raises in the minimum wage.<br />
<br />Thank you for taking action.<br />
<br />Sincerely,<br />
<br />Ann F. Lewis<br />
<br />P.S. We can win this fight if Congress knows that people are watching. Please forward this message to your friends and tell them to get involved.<br />
