<div>Ahhhh ...<br />The Iraq war has finally managed to bite the Republican party right in the ass.<br />
<br />While a small (really small) part of me feels almost sorry for the Republicans at this point ... lets face it, these ol' bastards so had it coming. George "Dubya" Bush and co. lied took a back door into a completely unecessary war for what ? Some petty vengence on Saddam Hussien for (supposedly) attempting to kill George (no new taxes) Bush Sr., or was it oil ...<br />
<br />If this war was for oil, I haven't seen a benefit yet. Killing people for oil is wrong as hell ... but seriously ... we've spilled our blood, NOW WHERE IS OUR GODAMN OIL.<br />
<br />I honest to god can't think of any logical reason why the Bush admin. wanted to invade, but if you think of anything please comment and tell me ... I would really love to know.<br />
<br />Thing is, some democrats are just as hawkish ...<br />I'll bet half of you didn't know that Hillary Clinton supported and still supports the war in Iraq. Joe Biden was in support of invading ... his current position on the matter is now kind of unknown, but considering Biden's history of being a pussy and taking refuge in the middle I doubt he'll change his tune unless it benefits the him politically.<br />
<br />John Kerry and John Edwards are finally beginning to stand up against this war after an entire campaign of pussyfooting around the issue ... unfourtuanatly it's unlikely that these two will even consider running again. The 2004 election should have gone to the democrats ... but the fact that John Kerry isn't exactly ... likable caused everyone who lacks the ability to reason to vote for the guy they'd rather have a beer with. (For all my Republican friends who supported Bush that was a joke ... I still love you ... in spite of your "lifestyle".)<br />
<br />In any case ... winning the '04 election has only given Bush more chances to screw himself over, and the '06 election will almost definitly be a huge blow to the Republicans.<br />
<br />In an msn.com poll (an unscientific one but still I don't think people who go on msn.com have much of a political bias) around 80% of people said they would vote democratic if the '06 elections were held right now.<br />
<br />The Republicans are screwed ... unfourtunatly they have another year to do damage.</div>
