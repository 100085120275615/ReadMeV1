<div><p>Feeling like the UK is home away from home.&nbsp; Like we haven't even really gotten our feet wet with all this.&nbsp; We have started to make plans, as we have discovered the 'asyougo' plan only works when you don't have to balance your checkbook at the end of it all.&nbsp; Our budget is so modest.&nbsp; Our financial advisor nearly choked himself when he heard us tell him to set aside a mere '40k' for our trip around the world.&nbsp; For two.&nbsp; After we outfitted, paid for travel insurance (and that doesn't include the major medical Vern got us as a wedding gift), and bought our exit tickets to the UK, we were down to about 36k.</p>

<p>The breakdown was to be:&nbsp; 10k in Europe and the South Pacific, and 5k in South America and Asia (southeast that is).&nbsp; Two days into trying to live off a budget of 100 USD a day in Dublin, we knew there was no way it was happenin.&nbsp; A 50 dollar a day budget is for the traveler who doesn't mind schlepping it in dormitory style hostels and coed bathrooms (thanks, but no thanks), and living off of a baguette and a slice of cheese for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.&nbsp; Save maybe room for a pint for dessert.</p>

<p>We ditched the confines of our ridiculous calculations and opted for the, no hassle approach.&nbsp; Our luck would have it that we were spending our first 3 weeks in one of the most expensive countries in Europe AND trying to find accommodations right in the middle of the busiest travel season of the year.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp; When we made it to Hillarys and pulled up our bank statement we nearly passed out.&nbsp; We had spent about 4500 USD.&nbsp; HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.&nbsp; So here we are about a month into our travels, and we are down half our entire Europe allocation.&nbsp; You know what this means?&nbsp; Como se dice,&nbsp; T-E-N-T?&nbsp; Only the cheapest tent rig we can find on the god damed POUND is the equivalent of about 300 usd.&nbsp; Say it with me now one more time, GOOD TIMES!</p>

<p>Zack gets all excited when we talk about the T-E-N-T, because you know, camping, is RUGGED...and well, one might suppose that with a good camping outfit one 'might could' travel for YEARS!!!&nbsp; This is not my idea of fun.&nbsp; I don't consider myself to be a girly girl, meaning, I don't labor over my hair and nails...I don't spend more than 10 minutes getting ready to go out...I don't require strawberries and champagne...and room service, and jacuzzis, hell I don't even care if there are cigarette burns in the hotel carpet.&nbsp; What I do enjoy is privacy.&nbsp; I like pillows that don't feel like sandbags (and if I can have TWO to sleep with I am over the moon) and 300 count bed sheets that don't smell like asshole.&nbsp; I like screens on my windows, and a toilet and shower that I don't have to put on shoes to go to.&nbsp; I don't need bathtubs, fresh flowers, chocolates on my pillows or jucuzzi tubs.&nbsp; Just give me a shower and shitter and lets call it a day.</p>

<p>But it appears thats all about to change, because WE (we, that means 1 + 1 = 2) are traveling the world FOR A YEAR on 36 thousand dollars.&nbsp; Think of it as if you had to live off of a 18k salary in the states for a year.&nbsp; Oh yeah baby.&nbsp; Only we have to cross oceans, like 3 times.</p>

<p>Get this.&nbsp; I set aside about 6k for airfare to cross those oceans when working our budget, which is why the budgets were only 10,10,5, and 5.&nbsp; That averaged to about 1500 usd to get the both of us flights across 4 legs.&nbsp; (europe to s.america, s.america to australia, australia to se.asia, and then europe back to the states).&nbsp; Started looking into the tickets from Europe to S.America and the cheapest fare I could find was going to cost us about 1600 bucks.&nbsp; Which is close to what I had planned, HOWEVER, what I did not realize was that in order to get from Europe to South America, one has to sit in a space no larger than a coat closet for 9 EFFING HOURS.&nbsp; Now.&nbsp; We sat in such space on the plane to Dublin from New York.&nbsp; Zack kindly offered me the MIDDLE seat so he wouldn't have to sit next to a stranger.&nbsp; I had no leg room.&nbsp; NONE.&nbsp; And I am only 5 foot 5.&nbsp; Perhaps the 5 hours ride wouldn't have been so bad had we been in first class.&nbsp; Only upgrading to even business class on any flight about doubles your fare.&nbsp; BASTARDS!&nbsp; So when I saw this whole 9+ hours non-stop flight business...I thought, ummm, no thanks.</p>

<p>So what is the alternative you ask?&nbsp; CRUISING BABY!!&nbsp; OH YEAH!&nbsp; Get this shit.&nbsp; I found us a nice, cheap, American company where I booked a 15 day cruise in USD (oh how i love the value of my dollar in my own country) from Portugal to Rio Di Janeiro for 2000 dollars.&nbsp; Thanks and have a nice day.&nbsp; The options were, 9+ hours off swampass and leg blood clots on a plane that would probably have gotten hijacked and cut our trip short, ORRRRRRRRRRR 15 days of poolside daiquiris, 24hour fitness clubs, and I quote 'chefs who will cook for even the PICKIEST OF EATERS'&nbsp; THATS ME!!!, mass unlimited quantities of 24 hour buffet food - that I can work off at the 24 hour gym - a day in Morocco, 2 days in the Cape Verde Islands, a day in the Canary Islands, a day in Recife, and Salvador, on the fabulous Holland America Line -&nbsp; <em>A Signature of Excellence</em>.&nbsp; I'll take <strong>Cruising for $1000</strong>, Alex.</p>

<p>So we have booked a 'gite' in Fontainebleau for a week, where Zack will get to release his inner Chris Sharma on some of the finest sandstone slopers in the world, and I will...well, I will lay on a couch and watch some french soap operas.&nbsp; Or something.&nbsp; We will then be off to Prague.&nbsp; Probably stopping off in Germany along the way...checking out Poland and then on to Austria and then Switzerland.&nbsp; Apparently there is some rock climbing there too.&nbsp; The boy has to see the rocks.&nbsp; Then we'll be in Italy for a few weeks...then south of France...then southern Spain....over to Mallorca (water rocks), then to Portugal eventually.&nbsp; Where we sail off on the majestic Holland America to get fat and play tennis for two weeks because we didn't want to sit on a plane for 9 hours.</p>

<p>In other news.&nbsp; We have been staying with 'the' Ben Moon.&nbsp; And his beautiful wife, Jo, who is super cool.&nbsp; They have a cute place here in Sheffield, where Zack is literally a hop skip and a jump away from the Peak District.&nbsp; AKA:&nbsp; boulder motherload.&nbsp; I went to the &quot;Shopping District&quot; yesterday and purchased a fabulous sweater wrap (they are way popular here, and I'll post a picture of me in it later...SO COOL), for myself...for Zack to give to me as a late birthday present.&nbsp; Aren't I so thoughtful?&nbsp; </p>

<p>Let me tell you something.&nbsp; It was like Chinese water torture walking around town surrounded by an ass ton of awesome shops knowing that any purchase I made has to go into a backpack that I have to carry for a year.&nbsp; That aside, between a week with the fabulous and oh so beautifully well put together Hillary, and hanging out with Jo (who should be a model...if she isn't already) and her friends (we had a poker night last Friday and a bunch of girls came over)...I am about to puke myself in the oh so FRAGRANT, cute/sexy/stylishness that surrounds me.&nbsp; Because I am nothing more than the third rotation of a North Face dry wicking t-shirt, and a pair of 'island hopper' Patagonia pants, and a doo-rag on my head.&nbsp; BLEH.</p>

<p>Oh how I miss my inner diva.</p>

<p>Scottish Carrie, that beyotch, has introduced me to the 'Tea Cake'.&nbsp; May she forever rot in hell, as I will now be forced to arrange a shipment of these god damned things back to the states.&nbsp; Or at the very least, a few boxes for my dear friends Anne and Julia whom I miss so much I could cry.&nbsp; You guys will then understand why Scottish Carrie, and her Scottish tea cakes are the devil.</p>
