Todayâs endorsement continues the steady stream of support from law enforcement for Cuomoâs campaign including the Patrolmenâs Benevolent Association, the Detectives Endowment Association and the Sergeants Benevolent Association,<br /><br />âAndrew Cuomoâs record of results, integrity and experience make him the best-qualified candidate to succeed Eliot Spitzer,â said Charles B. Billups, Chairperson of the Grand Council of Guardians. âAndrew has been a champion for law enforcement, our community and keeping our neighborhoods safer. From his start as a young prosecutor to serving in President Clintonâs cabinet where he took on reckless gun dealers and manufacturers, partnered with local police to curb crime in housing projects and launched the Officers Next Door Program, Andrew Cuomo has been and will continue to be an outstanding advocate for law enforcement and our safety.â<br /><br />âI am honored to join Eliot, David and Eric in receiving the support of the Grand Council of Guardians,â said Andrew Cuomo, New York State Attorney General candidate. âFor decades the Grand Council of Guardians has fought for justice and promoted unity, leadership and opportunity for African Americans in law enforcement who work hard every day to protect public safety. As Attorney General, I will work day in and day out to fight to protect New Yorkerâs safety, civil rights, and empowerment for all. I will fight to level the playing field and continue to defend and promote equality so that everyone in New York gets a fair shake.â<br /><br />Member organizations of the Grand Council of Guardians include: NYS Trooper Guardians, NYS Parole Ebony Society, NYS Correction Guardians, NYS Court Guardians, NYC Police Guardians, NYC Correction Guardians, NYC Sheriff Guardians, NYC School Safety Guardians, Westchester-Rockland County Police Guardians, Yonkers Police Guardians, Westchester Correction Guardians, Nassau County Police Guardians, Suffolk County Police Guardians, Brothers of The Shield (Nassau Correction), and the Bronze Shields ( Suffolk County Correction ).<br /><br />Andrew Cuomoâs Record Working with and Fighting for Law Enforcement<br /><br />Negotiated Landmark HUD Safe Gun Agreement with Smith & Wesson: In 2000, on behalf of the Clinton Administration, HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo negotiated the landmark Safe Gun Agreement with Smith &amp; Wessonâthe largest gun manufacturer in the nationâsetting the stage for a potential global industry-wide settlement and providing the template for subsequent gun manufacturer and gun dealer codes of conduct.<br />Created Nationwide Communities for Safer Guns Coalition: To promote the agreementâs code of conduct and ensure its implementation nationwide, Cuomo launched the Communities for Safer Guns Coalition comprised of more than 400 state and local governments around the nation. Coalition members pledged to give favorable consideration in their purchase of firearms to gun manufacturers that adopted new gun safety and dealer responsibility standards.<br /><br />Launched Officer Next Door Program: To help keep neighborhoods safe and make community policing a reality, Cuomo launched the Officer Next Door Program which allowed police officers to purchase homes in the communities they policed for half the price.<br /><br />Organized Gun Buyback and Violence Reduction Initiative: As HUD Secretary Cuomo organized the Gun Buyback and Violence Reduction Initiative, the largest gun buyback program in the nationâs history. This program helped to remove more than 10,000 guns from Americaâs streets. The program enabled police departments around the country to buy guns from the public on a âno questions askedâ basis.<br /><br />Cracked Down on Fraud and Abuse at HUD by Bringing in FBI: When Andrew took over HUD, it was in danger of being eliminated. The nearly 11,000-employee department was determined a âhigh riskâ for financial fraud by the GAO (Government Accounting Office), the only federal department so classified. Recognizing that the Congress and the public deserve accountability from the department, Andrew initiated an effort to ârestore the public trustâ at HUD. Andrewâs restoration effort for the âpublic trustâ had two components: integrity and competence. Much like the Medicaid program today in New York State, the integrity and competence of HUD was questioned. Andrew asked Congress for 2 years to turn HUD around. He immediately went to work announcing âGet Toughâ and âZero Toleranceâ programs to clean up HUD.<br /><br />ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE ANDREW CUOMO ENDORSED BY REVEREND AR BERNARD, SR.<br /><br />Major New York Community and Religious Leader Highlights Cuomoâs Record Fighting Discrimination and for Empowering all New Yorkers.<br /><br />Brooklyn, NY (August 27, 2006) â New York State Attorney General candidate Andrew Cuomo today received the endorsement of Reverend AR Bernard, Sr., one of New Yorkâs major religious and community leaders. Reverend Bernard is the founder of the Christian Cultural Center located in Brooklyn which boasts a membership of 25,000.<br /><br />âAll things considered, Andrew Cuomo is the most qualified candidate to succeed Eliot Spitzer as Attorney General,â said Reverend AR Bernard, Sr. âAndrew has been fighting for racial and social justice for most of his life. He has been a champion for our community, for civil rights, and empowering all New Yorkers. From establishing HELP, the nation's largest provider of services to the homeless, to bringing 2000 anti-discrimination actions while serving on President Clinton's cabinet, suing the KKK, and standing up with Senator Charles Schumer and me against predatory lenders, Andrew Cuomo has proven his steadfast commitment to fighting the good fight. I know we can count on Andrew Cuomo to be the toughest advocate for all New Yorkers."<br /><br />âI am honored and humbled to receive the support Pastor Bernard,â said Andrew Cuomo, New York State Attorney General candidate. âPastor Bernard and First Lady Karen Bernard have built an extraordinary, thriving and vibrant community. As Attorney General, I will work day in and day out to fight to protect all New Yorkers. I will fight to protect their civil rights, to fight discrimination and to stand up to the powerful special interests that put profits over people. I will fight to level the playing field so that everyone in New York gets a fair shake.â<br /><br />Andrew Cuomoâs Record Fighting for Civil Rights and Empowerment<br /><br />Under Andrew Cuomoâs leadership, the number of African American families that realized the American dream of buying a home grew significantly because of changes to HUDâs Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage program benefiting millions of families, at no cost to taxpayers. HUD also helped 255,000 New York families purchase homes by providing $25.4 billion of mortgage insurance through the FHA, and reduced the cost of buying a home by lowering mortgage insurance costs. Almost 40 percent of all African Americans who bought a home did so with HUD assistance.<br /><br />Andrew fought against predatory lending to protect consumers and others by exposing the nationwide problem. Through the first federal Task Force on Predatory Lending, launched in March of 2000, Andrew worked with the Department of Treasury to tackle the problem through new enforcement legislation and regulatory reform. Working with Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, the Task Force recommendations were designed to protect consumers who were being ripped off and put an end to these abusive practices. The Task Forceâs report detailed recommendations on legislative, regulatory, and other steps to curb the increasing occurrence of predatory mortgage lending.<br /><br />Andrew also took on predatory lending in the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). FHAâs Homebuyer Protection Plan protected borrowers from bad appraisals and the Credit Watch program terminated lenders from FHA programs if they have excessive default rates. In October 2000, Andrew announced a $1.1 million grant in housing counseling grants to New York City agencies to fight predatory lending. He also launched âHot Zonesâ in cities with particularly high FHA foreclosure rates. Twenty-four New York City neighborhoods, including neighborhoods in Harlem, benefited from the Hot Zone program which served homebuyers threatened by predatory lenders. Consumers in the Hot Zones benefited from services such as expanded counseling, a moratorium on foreclosures and assistance to those facing foreclosure, and a crackdown against bad appraisers, lenders and real estate agents.<br /><br />Andrew Cuomo played a key role in the development and implementation of the Clinton Administrationâs signature economic development program, Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community program which brought over $100 million in federal funds and over $300 million in other investments for economic development and other activities to New York. In New York City $300 million in Empowerment Zone funds (including funds matched by the State and the City) were used to create new jobs in Harlem by leveraging significant private sector investments from major retailers. The Empowerment Zone provided funding and attracted investment for Harlem U.S.A., a major retail and entertainment complex on 125th Street and Frederick Douglass Boulevard.<br /><br />**NYC MEDIA ADVISORY**<br /><br />MONDAY, AUGUST 28th, 2006 AT 10:00 AM<br /><br />NYS ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE ANDREW CUOMO AND FORMER CONGRESSMAN REVEREND FLOYD FLAKE DISCUSS CIVIL RIGHTS AND EMPOWERMENT ISSUES<br /><br />On Monday, August 28th, 2006 at 10:00 AM on the steps of New York City Hall, New York State attorney general candidate Andrew Cuomo and former Congressman Floyd Flake will discuss civil rights and empowerment issues.<br /><br />WHAT: NYS attorney general candidate Andrew Cuomo and former Congressman Reverend Floyd Flake discuss civil rights and empowerment issues.<br /><br />WHEN: 10:00 AM on Monday, August 28th, 2006.<br /><br />WHERE: Steps of New York City Hall.<br /><br />ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE ANDREW CUOMO ENDORSED BY FORMER CONGRESSMAN REVEREND DR.
