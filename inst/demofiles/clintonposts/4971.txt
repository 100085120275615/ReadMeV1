<span><em>I am watching the FoxNews coverage of Bush's State of the Union speech. So, the pre-speech patter.....apparently, Cindy Sheehan was removed from the hall before the President arrived. She was the guest of someone (?) to be determined. She tried to unfurl some sort of sign and was removed. I'm sure there will be more about this later. Send her back to Venezuela.<br /><br />Ok. The President is introduced. Lots of loud cheering and clapping. All stand up.<br /><br />He starts with a tribute to Coretta Scott King. Great opening.<br /><br />Then makes an attempt to reach across the aisle with an olive branch, offering to do his part to work together and overcome differences for the good of the country.<br /><br /></em>Road of isolationisma and protectionism may seem wide and inviting....but ends in destruction.<br /><br />Historic long term goal, seek the end of tyranny in our world. Future security of America depends upon it.<br /><br />Democracies replace resentment with hope...and join the fight against terror. We will act boldly in freedom's cause.<br /><br />in 1945, two dozen lonely democracies in the world, today there are 122.<br /><br />More than half the people of our world live in democratic nations. We don't forget the other half. Demands of justice require their freedom as well.<br /><br />No one can deny the success of freedom. But some men fight and rage against it.<br /><br /></span><span><em>Good. He comes out with an olive branch and then boldly re-states the rationale behind his foreign policy--spread freedom throughout the world. And explains why it is important. Gets a standing ovation from evryone. Nancy Pelosi is even standing.<br /></em><br />If we were to leave these vicious attackers alone, they would not leave us alone. There is no peace in retreat and there is no honor in retreat.<br /><br />We would signal to all that we no longer believe in our own ideals. The U.S. will not retreat from the world and we will never retreat from evil.<br /><br />America rejects the false comfort of isolationism.<br /><br />We accept the call of history to rescue the oppressed.<br /><br /></span><span><em>Now he lays out his plan for Iraq, explaining that we are helping them establish a government, build infrastructure and get rid of terrorists.

Mentions Dan Clay and reads from a letter he left to his family.</em><br /><br />"I know what honor is...I faced death with the secure knowledge that you would not have to."<br /><br /><em>Dan Clay's parents and wife stand to applause.</em> </span><br /><br /><span>The only way to defeat the terrorists is to...offer the hopeful alternative of political freedom and peaceful change.<br /><br /></span><span><em>He mentions Egypt, Palestine, calls for Hamas to reject terrorism and embrace peace.<br /></em><br />Liberty is the right of all humanity.<br /><br /><em>Now he turns to Iran. </em></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Regime sponsors terrorists and that must come to an end. Nations of the world must not permit Iranian regime to gain nuclear weapons. America will continue to rally the world to confront these threats.<br /><br /><em>Speaks directly to the people of Iran. </em></span><br /><span></span><br /><span>Our nation hopes to be the closest of friends with a free and democratic Iran.<br /><br />Isolation ties our hands in fighting enemies, but helping abroad....AIDS, infant with malaria, young girl sold into slavery....</span><span><em>nice sequeway from our military agenda to why the U.S. has a responsibility to help other countries.<br /></em><br /><em>Mentions offensive against terrorism in U.S. Thanks the Homeland Security, FBI, Law Enforcement.</em> </span><br /><span></span><br /><span>They deserve the same tools they use to fight drug trafficking and organized crime....re-authorize the Patriot Act.<br /><br />Before 9/11, our government failed to connect the dots.

Created 4.6M new jobs more than Japan and the EU combined. Can't be complacent. Competitors like China and India. Old temptation. Protectionism. Wall off our economy. Government needs a larger role--centralize and increase taxes. Immigrants are important--economy can't function without them.<br /><br />Agenda for a nation that competes with confidence, raise standard of living and create new jobs. Keep economy growing. Economy grows when Americans have more of their own money. Tax relief can set to expire. American families face a tax increase they do not expect. Calls for Dems to make the tax cuts permanent.<br /><br /></span><span><em>Dems sit.<br /><br /></em>Need to be good stewards of tax dollars. Cut spending.

When the boomers retire, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will comprise 60% of the entire federal budget. Congress did not act on my proposal to save Social Security. </span><span><em>In un-classy act, Dems stand and clap. Bush gets excited and wags his finger at them.<br /></em><br />Rising cost of entitlements is a rising cost that is not going away.

Activist courts redefine marriage. Unethical politiicians. Must never give in to belief that America is in decline.<br /><br />We need courts that deliver equal justice under the law.
