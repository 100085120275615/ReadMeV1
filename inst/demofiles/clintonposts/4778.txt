	<p>The Bible instructs us not to be ignorant of Satan&#8217;s evices and it predicts that, as the Second Coming of Christ draws near, the world will be drawn into a One World Government, ultimately to be taken over by a Coming World Leader1. The forces setting the stage for this final climactic chapter may have proceeded farther than most people realize.<br />
Few Americans know of the betrayal that was plotted on Jekyll Island, Georgia, which was destined to defraud Americans of their wealth and opportunity, and would eventually lead to the subjugation of our great democratic experiment to a centralized global dictatorship.2<br />
The Betrayal<br />
In November of 1910, after having consulted with Rothschild banks in England, France, and Germany, Senator Nelson Aldrich3 boarded a private train in Hoboken, New Jersey. His destination was Jekyll Island, Georgia, and a private hunting club owned by J.P. Morgan.4<br />
Aboard the train were six other men: Benjamin Strong, President of Morgan&#8217;s Bankers Trust Company; Charles Norton, President of Morgan&#8217;s First National Bank of New York; Henry Davidson, senior partner of J. P. Morgan; Frank Vanderlip, President of Kuhn Loeb&#8217;s National City Bank of New York; A. Piatt Andrew, Assistant Secretary of Treasury; and Paul Warburg.5 The secret meeting, as described by one its architects, Frank Vanderlip, went as follows:<br />
&#8220;There was an occasion near the close of 1910 when I was as secretive, indeed as furtive, as any conspirator. I do not feel it is any exaggeration to speak of our secret expedition to Jekyll Island as the occasion of the actual conception of what eventually became the Federal Reserve System.<br />
&#8220;We were told to leave our last names behind us. We were told further that we should avoid dining together on the night of our departure. We were instructed to come one at a time&#8230; where Senator Aldrich&#8217;s private car would be in readiness, attached to the rear end of the train for the South.<br />
&#8220;Once aboard the private car, we began to observe the taboo that had been fixed on last names. Discovery, we knew, simply must not happen, or else all our time and effort would be wasted&#8230;&#8221;6<br />
The goal was to establish a private bank that would control the national currency. The challenge was to slip the scheme by the representatives of the American people. Earlier, it had been called the Aldrich Bill and received effective opposition.<br />
The devious planners of the revised bill titled it &#8220;The Federal Reserve Act&#8221; to mask its real nature. It would create a system controlled by private individuals who would control the nation&#8217;s issue of money. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Board, composed of twelve districts and one director (The Federal Reserve Chairman) would control the nation&#8217;s financial resources by controlling the money supply and available credit, all by mortgaging the government through borrowing.<br />
Divide and Conquer<br />
The conspirators had a problem, however. President William Howard Taft had made it clear he would veto such a bill if it was introduced. They had to make sure he would not win reelection.<br />
They first supported ex-President Teddy Roosevelt in the Republican primaries, but he failed to get the nomination. Then the bankers supported the Democratic contender, Woodrow Wilson.<br />
In exchange for their support, Wilson promised to sign their bill into law. But the polls indicated that Wilson would only draw about 45% of the votes. The bankers needed someone who could draw a sufficient number of Republican votes away from Taft without harming their Democratic candidate. They arranged for Teddy Roosevelt to run against both men by representing a newly invented third party: the &#8220;Bull Moose&#8221; party. (Doesn&#8217;t this sound familiar? Using a Ross Perot to defeat George Bush and get Bill Clinton elected? Dividing the votes of the potential winner to elect a minority candidate is a tactic used more frequently than we realize.)<br />
The plan worked. The Federal Reserve Bill was held until December 23 (two days before Christmas!) before it was presented to the House and Senate. Only those senators and congressmen who had not gone home for the holidays&#8211;those who owed favors to, or were on the payroll of, the bankers&#8211;were present to sign the legislation. (Involved behind the scenes in the elections of Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt was &#8220;Colonel&#8221; Edward Mandell House, son of the Civil War Rothschild agent Thomas W. House.7 &#8220;Col&#8221; Edward House represented the interests of the Rothschild banks, and was originally a member of the Institute of International Affairs, formed in Paris at the Majestic Hotel in a secret meeting on May 30, 1919. Its American branch, formed on July 29, 1921, became the Council on Foreign Relations.)<br />
The Charade Begins<br />
The Federal Reserve Act of 1913 was a deliberate charade to pacify the American voters. They&#8217;d been crying out for banking reform and had held scores of elections, alternating one set of politicians with another, only to find them selves with the same programs and deeper debt.<br />
Congressman Charles A. Lindbergh Sr.8 had complained at the time:<br />
&#8220;It is a common practice of congressmen to make the title of acts promise aright, but in the body or text of the acts to rob the people of what is promised in the title.&#8221;9<br />
He pointed out that the government officeholders understood:<br />
&#8220;&#8230;that by joining with the [banking] interests to exploit the people, their reelection is more certain than if they serve people who elect them. By joining the exploiters their campaign expenses are paid, the support of the &#8216;machines&#8217; and the capital press is assured, and if by chance they should lose they are appointed to the same office that should suit them equally or better.&#8221;10<br />
The same phenomenon is visible today. The same cast of characters emerge in key positions whether the nation votes Democrat or Republican. Both sides appear to have sold out. (This tradition of betrayal has continued with the &#8220;North American Free Trade Agreement,&#8221; and the GATT &#8220;Agreement,&#8221; both of which were called &#8220;agreements&#8221; to avoid having to pass the 2/3 majority of the Senate. However, the White House Internet files labeled them &#8220;treaties&#8221; as soon as they were passed.) Even Woodrow Wilson felt he had made a terrible mistake in signing the bill. He later wrote:<br />
&#8220;Some of the biggest men in the United States in the field of commerce and manufacture are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it&#8230;&#8221;11<br />
The name &#8220;Federal Reserve Bank&#8221; was designed to deceive, and it still does. It is not federal, nor is it owned by the government. It is privately owned. It pays its own postage like any other corporation. Its employees are not civil service. Its physical property is held under private deeds and is subject to local taxation (government property is not).<br />
It is an engine that has created private wealth that is unimaginable, even to the most financially sophisticated. It has enabled an imperial elite to manipulate our economy for its own agenda and enlisted the government itself as its enforcer. It &#8220;controls the times, dictates business, affects our homes and practically everything in which we are interested.&#8221;12<br />
How Does It Work?<br />
The Federal Reserve System is nothing more than a group of private banks which charge interest on money that never existed.<br />
The government prints a billion dollars&#8217; worth of interest-bearing U.S. Government bonds and takes them to the Federal Reserve; the Federal Reserve accepts them and places $1 billion in a checking account and the government writes checks to the total of $1 billion.<br />
Where was that $1 billion before they touched the computer to make the entry? It didn&#8217;t exist. We allow this private banking system to create money out of absolutely nothing (all of it a loan to our government) and charge interest on it forever. The bank collects interest on the government&#8217;s own money. This summary of a highly complex system is oversimplified but accurate.<br />
A communique sent from the Rothschild investment house in England to its associate in New York remarked:<br />
&#8220;The few who understand the system&#8230;will either be so interested in its profits or so dependent on its favors that there will be no opposition from that class, while on the other hand, the great body of people, mentally incapable of comprehending&#8230;will bear its burdens without complaint.&#8221;13<br />
The Results<br />
The principal shareholders of the Federal Reserve include: Rothschild Banks of England and Berlin; Warburg Banks of Hamburg and Amsterdam; Laz ard Brothers Banks of Paris; Israel Moses Seiff Banks of Italy; Chase Manhattan Bank of New York; Lehman Brothers of New York; Kuhn, Loeb of New York; and Goldman, Sachs of New York. This profitable charade has been going on for 81 years!<br />
The power transfer created by the Federal Reserve System was further extended with the Monetary Control Act of 1980 which gave the Federal Reserve System control over all depository institutions, whether or not the banks were members of the system.<br />
This act also, among other things, gave the Federal Reserve the power to use the debt of foreign nations as collateral for the printing of Federal Reserve notes. This now permits saddling the American tax payers with foreign debts!<br />
The unseen ruling class enjoy an imperial wealth&#8211;the Rothschilds have over 76 palaces around the world&#8211;and they know what they want and how to obtain it. One of their ultimate luxuries is privacy. Great wealth can bring great privacy. Finance has always manipulated business, and it generally strangles all enterprise that attempts to compete with it. The private international bankers achieve their desires through legislation.<br />
&#8220;The Federal Reserve Act gives a power to the Federal Reserve Banks that makes the government impotent to protect the interests of the people.&#8221;14<br />
Informed Outcries<br />
On Tuesday, December 15, 1931, Louis T. McFadden, chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee, proclaimed:<br />
&#8220;The Federal Reserve Board and banks are the duly appointed agents of the foreign central banks of issue and they are more concerned with their foreign customer than they are with the people of the United States. The only thing that is American about the Federal Reserve Board and banks is the money they use&#8230;&#8221;15<br />
On Friday, June 10, 1932, McFadden again pleaded his case with his fellow colleagues:<br />
&#8220;Mr. Chairman, we have in this country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known. I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks&#8230;<br />
&#8220;Some people think that the Federal Reserve Banks are United States Government institutions. They are not government institutions. They are private credit monopolies which prey upon the people of the United States for the benefit of themselves and their foreign customers; foreign and domestic speculators and swindlers; and rich and predatory money lenders. In that dark crew of financial pirates there are those who would cut a man&#8217;s throat to get a dollar out of his pocket; there are those who send money into the States to buy votes to control our legislation; and there are those who maintain an international propaganda for the purpose of deceiving us and wheedling us into granting of new concessions which will permit them to cover up their past misdeeds and set again in motion their gigantic train of crime.&#8221;16<br />
The twelve regional Federal Reserve banks are also members of this private cartel. Before the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, while the Federal Reserve Bill was under discussion, attorney Alfred Crozier from Ohio observed:<br />
&#8220;&#8230;the imperial power of elasticity of the public currency is wielded exclusively by these central corporations owned by the banks. This is a life and death power over all local banks and all business. It can be used to create or destroy prosperity, to ward off or cause stringencies and panics. By making money artificially scarce, interest rates throughout the country can be arbitrarily raised and the bank tax on all business and cost of living increased for the profit of the banks owning these regional central banks, and without the slightest benefit to the people. These twelve corporations together cover the whole country and monopolize and use for private gain every dollar of the public currency and all public revenues of the United States. Not a dollar can be put into circulation among the people by their government without the consent of (and on terms fixed by) these twelve private money trusts.&#8221;17<br />
Thomas Jefferson said:<br />
&#8220;I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies. Already they have raised up a money aristocracy that has set the government at defiance. That issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the government to whom it properly belongs.&#8221;<br />
The Kennedy Plan<br />
President John F. Kennedy planned to exterminate the Federal Reserve System and ultimately eliminate the national debt, as had Andrew Jackson and Abraham Lincoln before him when they did the same to the two Rothschild-organized central banks. In 1963, by presidential order of John F. Kennedy (EO 11 and EO 110), the United States Treasury began printing over $4 billion worth of &#8220;United States Notes&#8221; to replace Federal Reserve Notes. When a sufficient supply of these notes entered circulation, the Federal Reserve Notes&#8211;and the System&#8211;could be declared obsolete. This would end the control of the international bankers over the U.S. government and the American people.<br />
Some of these bills can still be found. They can be recognized by their distinctive red seal on the front of the bill instead of the green seal of Federal Reserve Notes. Above the portrait appears the words &#8220;United States Note.&#8221; Printed were $2 and $5 notes,18 series 1963, and C. Douglas Dillon&#8217;s signature appears as Secretary of Treasury. The reverse side of these bills is identical to the Federal Reserve Notes.<br />
After putting this plan into effect, John F. Kennedy was professionally assassinated in Dealey Plaza. The subsequent coverup was so skillful that even to this day few Americans realize the coup d&#8217;etat that was engineered to save the System. (Otto von Habsburg&#8217;s remarks still echo in my ears: &#8220;The concentration of power in America is frightening.&#8221;)<br />
Meyer Amschel Rothschild&#8217;s original plan of two centuries ago for &#8220;a new order of a one world government&#8221; appears to be succeeding. No wonder the Great Seal of the United States, on the back side of the one dollar bill, bears the inscription Novus Ordo Seclorum: New World Order.19<br />

Senator Nelson Aldrich&#8217;s daughter married John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and his grandson, Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, was Gerald Ford&#8217;s Vice President in 1974.<br />
J.P. Morgan&#8217;s father was a gun runner for both sides in the Civil War and a Rothschild agent for the South.<br />
He was sent by the House of Warburg in Germany, a branch of the Rothschild banks. Some believe that Warburg, in collusion with Jacob Schiff, head of the New York invest ment firm of Kuhn, Loeb &#038; Co., engineered the panic of 1907 to set the stage for the schemes that followed.<br />

Thomas House may have been implicated in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln when President Lincoln threatened the banking interests. See the article in Personal UPDATE, February 1995.<br />
