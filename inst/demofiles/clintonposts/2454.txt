<strong>Considering he writes for Alan Keyes' website</strong>, <a href="http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/zeiger/040806">Scoutmaster Zeiger</a> has found it fitting to put in his two cents on the Illinois senate race.  This column is probably the most priceless Zeiger moment in the alst few months.  Look upon it, and watch your mouth drop as the insanity flies from the screen:
<br />
<blockquote>It will be the competition between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas all over again. Barack Obama is Steven Douglas, and Alan Keyes is Abraham Lincoln.</blockquote>
<br />::pigs fly out of ass::
<br />Alan Keyes should not be mentioned in the same sentence as Abraham Lincoln.  Ever.  And please decide whether it's "Stephen" or "Steven."
<br />
<blockquote>With Alan Keyes in the ring, Obama will have no choice but to debate ideas.</blockquote>
<br />Which is exactly what the man has been doing for six months.  He challenged Ryan to debates, but Ryan went down in flames.  
<br />
<blockquote>Obama is so liberal that he, John Kerry, and John Edwards would have to compare the physical dynamics of their bleeding hearts to see who was more liberal.</blockquote>
<br />I'll bet pissed himself when he wrote that, he thought it was so funny.  Or maybe he treats his writing as a masturbatory exercise and ejaculated as he wrote it.  Wait, what am I thinking.  Masturbation is a sin, and so is thinking about it. Masturbation is for Planned Parenthood and gays.  
<br />That joke sound like a "your mama" joke.  Your mama is so liberal that...
<br />
<blockquote>Obama is completely, unabashedly, enthusiastically pro-death</blockquote>
<br />As am I.  I love death. Love it, love it, love it.  
<br />
<blockquote>With more power than any other candidate anywhere this year, Keyes will defend human life, marriage, and the constitution.</blockquote>
<br />And his $500,000 debt from his last election bid.  Of course, Zeiger makes no mention of Keyes' flip-flopping criticism of Hillary's carpet-bagging in 2000. And he juxtaposes all of this talk about freedom while criticizing Barack Obama for working to provide freedom for gays. But I guess its only freedom for certain people.  
<br />All in all, the endorsment of the Scoutmaster ensures that Keyes will lose.  Strange bedfellows are a great indicator of the real campaign. </div>
