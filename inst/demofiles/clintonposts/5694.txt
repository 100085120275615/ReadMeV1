What a horrible two weeks.<br /><br />The Senate took what has to be one of the worst bills EVER to be brought to the floor of the US Capital and debated small amendments to appear they were addressing the illegal immigration crisis.<br /><br />They began their session by re-submitting the Hagel/Martinez bill which was based on the three bills the Senate rejected a few weeks earlier.<br /><br />Throughout the debate and amendments, two distinct groups formed on the issue. The was the amnesty group, which pandered to illegal aliens and fought for increased illegal immigration. This group was comprised of 90% of the Democrats and a handful of GOP like McCain, Specter, Craig, Chafee, and Martinez. This group had the support of Presidents Bush and Fox. The other group was the enforcement group, focused on border security and reducing illegal immigration. This group comprised of 80% of the GOP and a handful of Democrats like Byrd and Dorgan. This group is aligned with the majority of the House, who passed an enforcement only bill nearly six months ago.<br /><br />The first amendment proposed required the <strong>border be secure</strong> before implementing any guest worker program or grant <strong>amnesty</strong>. That was defeated <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00121">40-55</a>. While not a party line split, 84% of Democrats voted for amnesty while 65% of Republicans voted for border security.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00125">All</a> the Senators voted for an amendment that prohibits an illegal alien from receiving amnesty if they has been convicted of a <strong>felony or at least three misdemeanors</strong>. This follows the failed 1986 amnesty language that failed to enforce the immigration laws. Those that fail to learn history are forced to something, somethingâ¦. Hey, at least these illegal alien felons can still run for Congress!<br /><br />Another amendment was a weak attempt at appeasing the House enforcement-only bill to construct 370 miles of <strong>fencing</strong> along our border. This was half the amount the House approved. The Senate passed this by an <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00126">83-16</a> vote. The 16 Senators that did not want to help secure the border were all Democrats (and a liberal Independent) including: Kennedy, Lieberman, Menendez, Durbin, Feingold, and Obama.<br /><br />The Senate then decided to table an amendment that would prohibit illegal aliens from collecting <strong>Social Security</strong>. The vote was <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00130">50-49</a> vote. The 50 Senators that voted to ensure illegal aliens received their Social Security checks included: Biden, Boxer, Clinton, Durbin, Feinstein, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Martinez, McCain, Mikulski, Obama, Reid, Schumer, and Specter.<br /><br />The Senate by voice vote approved DHS to construct <strong>detention facilities</strong> for 20,000 additional illegal aliens. While we desperately need more detention facilities, they capped it so we can only detain an additional 2% of the million who are detained annually. Considering everyone is getting amnesty, I don't know who would actually qualify to be detained.<br /><br />Next the Senate needed to reinforce President Bush's decision to deploy <strong>National Guard</strong> troops to the border. They passed an amendment <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00137">83-10</a> to grant the governors of border states (in concert with the DoD) the authority to deploy troops to the border. The 10 Senators who didn't want to secure the border included 6 Republicans, 3 Democrats, and the retiring Independent. The Senate's most notable veteran and Presidential hopeful McCain was among the 7 Senators who chose not to vote.<br /><br />The Democrats wanting to make perfectly clear where they stood had Senator Feinstein introduce an amendment that would make an additional two million illegal aliens eligible for amnesty. This vote failed <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00138">37-61</a>. The 36 Democrats that wanted to campaign via the <strong>No Illegal Alien Left Behind</strong> strategy included: Biden, Boxer, Clinton, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Menendez, Obama, Reid, and Schumer. RINO Chafee wanted to hang with the Dems on this one.<br /><br />While <strong>terrorists</strong> coming across the border was never a strong point in the immigration debate, the Senate couldn't miss an opportunity to appear to be addressing the problem. They "closed a loophole" that would allow terrorists to enter the country. The amendment passed <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00139">79-19</a>. Whew, we're all safe now. Yet I believe the ACLU threatened to sue because the bill would infringe on the civil rights of terrorists. Good thing 19 Senators voted against this. Osama, you can send your thank you cards to Chafee, Coleman, Feingold, Kennedy, Kerry, Levin, Lieberman, Obama, and Reid.<br /><br />Senator Durbin wanted to ensure an illegal alien could get a <strong>waiver</strong> if his inadmissibility or removal would result in <strong>hardship</strong> for a spouse, parent, or child who is a citizen or permanent resident alien. So while we don't need to worry about the impact to the family of a US citizen sentenced to prison, we do need to ensure any illegal alien who wants to come here can, or if they're caught are not deported. They just need to have an anchor baby or be related to someone who does. This waiver amendment was tabled by a vote of <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00142">63-34</a>. The 34 Senators who voted for the âmother of all loopholesâ include: Biden, Boxer, Clinton, Durbin, Feingold, Feinstein, Kennedy, Kerry, Lieberman, Menendez, Mikulski, Obama, Reid, and Specter.<br /><br />The Senate decided they had enough fun and decided it was time to vote for <strong>cloture</strong> to end debate on the bill. If 40 Senators voted against cloture, it would essentially kill the bill. Regrettably, the cloture vote passed <a href="http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=109&session=2&amp;vote=00144">73-25</a>. I would like to thank the 25 Senators who voted in the best interest of America, and not their party or to pander to illegal aliens. These 23 Republicans and 2 Democrats deserve our utmost support: Allard, Allen, Bond, Bunning, Burns, Burr, Byrd, Chambliss, Coburn, Crapo, DeMint, Dole, Dorgan, Ensign, Grassley, Inhofe, Isakson, Roberts, Santorum, Sessions, Shelby, Sununu, Talent, Thune, and Vitter.<br /><br />So letâs review. This bill will grant<strong> amnesty to over 12 million illegal aliens</strong> via a bureaucratic overburdened agency. What little enforcement of our laws to deport illegal aliens today, will be further minimized as everyone is allowed to stay while waiting on the <strong>short line to citizenship</strong>. Meanwhile, the hundreds of millions in Mexico and Latin America who were contemplating the northward migration now have a<strong> huge incentive to get here</strong> before the amnesty deal runs out! But donât worry, so long as you have at least one family member in the US, you should have no problem getting in. Current estimates project this legislation will lead to <strong>100-200 million more immigrants</strong> (illegal and legal via loopholes) entering in the next 20 years. While illegal aliens currently overwhelm our schools, hospitals, and social services, as citizens they will have many <strong>more âentitlementsâ</strong> afforded to them like social security, welfare, and Medicaid. While the <strong>net costs of illegal immigration</strong> today rivals the costs of Katrina or the Iraq War, this will now grow to levels on par with our budgets for Medicaid, Medicare, and Social Security.<br /><br />If ever given the opportunity to talk with your Senator, I urge you to ask them two simple questions:<br />1. How does this bill address the illegal immigration crisis?<br />2. How is this bill is good for America?<br /><br />Today the Senate will make it final and pass this horrible legislation. The bill will then go into conference with the House enforcement-only version. I pray the House has enough backbone to dismiss the Senate version entirely. At this point, passing no new immigration laws would be better than this bill.<br /><br />Stay tunedâ¦
