Once considered liberal and progressive, the Republican Party has been taken over by right-wing conservative con artists who lie, cheat and steal to gain and maintain power. From voter fraud and suppression to smear campaigns, personal attacks and media manipulation, they have been using the same strategies for more than a hundred years.<br /><br />While Democratic Dirty Tricks prominently show up around FDR's first election in '32, Kennedy/Nixon (Chicago) in '60 and Lyndon Johnson in '64, these lead to The New Deal, Social Security and Civil Rights while Republican Dirty Tricks give us depressions, poverty and massive national debt.<br /><br />Republicans know if most people vote, they would never win so they try to demoralize the Democratic base and suppress the vote as much as possible, they buy some people off with tax cuts and scare the rest into voting against their own interests and that's how they win. It's a divide and conquer strategy that has worked well and they refine and expand it every election year.<br /><br /><span>Republican Strategy:</span><br /><ul>   <li>Demoralize the Democratic base with phony press releases and whisper campaigns.</li>   <li>Attack oponents strength with character assasination.</li>   <li>Suppress the vote in every possible way.</li>   <li>Buy some people off with tax cuts.</li>   <li>Scare the rest into voting against their own interests.</li> </ul> In the 2004 election there was massive GOP voter fraud and suppression; from black box voting fraud, vote tabulating fraud, re-registering people into different precincts, destroying voter registration forms, misinformation in poor neighborhoods, moving polls close to election day, old ballot machines in poor and black neighborhoods that spoil votes, ballot checking machines in wealthy neighborhoods that allow wealthy voters to re-cast spoiled ballots, police intimidation, caging lists and on and on and on. The result was an 8 million vote discrepancy between the official results and exit polls. The official results had Bush winning by 3 million votes but the exit polls had Kerry winning by 5 million votes.<br /><br />Republicans have two major factors on their side; a fanatical base willing to carry out the dirty tricks and the greediest billionaires to finance them. They deceive good people by raising the red flag of abortion and gay marriage to divert attention away from their arrogant and greedy policies which cause the poverty, war and pollution we are facing today.<br /><br />The next time a Republican tells you âAmerica, love it or leave it.â Tell them you love America. You just want right-wing conservatives to stop molesting her. If they act like they don't know what you're talking about, send them here.<br /><br /><br /><strong>History of Right-wing Conservative Dirty Tricks </strong><br />'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''<br /><strong>1789 </strong>- Right-wing conservatives have deceptively co-opted the flag, religion, christmas and our founding fathers.

Grant - Corruption, Graft, and Bribery</span><br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1359/1261/320/Grant.jpg" border="0" />The Republican administration of Ulysses S. Grant was one of the most corrupt and disastrous in U.S. history. The "Credit Mobilier" (Railroad) scandal, the "Whiskey Ring" scandal and the Depression of 1873 led to the quick end of reconstruction in the South and left newly freed slaves at the mercy of southern retribution for more than 80 years. The Whiskey Ring Scandal involved a group of distillers who were found falsifying reports and cheating the government out of millions in tax dollars. Many of president Grant's appointees were involved in the scandal including Grant's personal secretary, Orville E. Babcock. Even though the prosecutor had mounds of evidence against him, Babcock was acquitted but was forced to resign.<br /><br /><span>The Railroad Scandal</span><br /><br />The greatest financial scandal of the nineteenth century was orchestrated by a collusion between industrialists and key Republican congressman and members of the Grant administration who arranged for the Credit Mobilier holding company to receive government land and money to build a railroad out west. In return these men received bribes and kickbacks and the railroad was never built.<br /><br />Many railroad builders viewed the Plains Indians as obstacles to be removed. General William Tecumseh Sherman had written in 1867: "The more we can kill this year, the less will have to be killed the next year, for the more I see of these Indians the more convinced I am that they all have to be killed or be maintained as a species of paupers."<br /><br /><span>Custer's Last Stand</span><br /><br />In 1876, president Grant's Secretary of War, William Belknep, was under investigation for accepting bribes in connection with the Indian Agency. Belknap also sold trading post appointments (along with Grants brother Orvil) and received kickbacks which caused high prices at the trading posts where U.S. soldiers were forced, by regulations to buy from exclusively. Lt. Col. George Custer had previously arrested Ulysses S. Grant's son, Fred, during the Black Hills Expedition and now began an investigation into the trading post corruption. He labeled the traders "a bunch of crooks," adding that Secretary Belknap was the "chief of the thieves." Custer was being groomed by Democrats to run for president in the next election but before he could give congressional testimony about the corruption, Custer found himself surrounded by hundreds of Indians armed with hundreds of new repeating rifles against Army issue, single shot rifles. Where did those dirt poor, Indians get all that high tech fire power?<br /><br />The Battle of the Little Bighorn, or "Custer's Last Stand," coincidentally solved all the Republicans problems by taking the focus off their scandals and was also used to inflame Indian hatred and remove the rest of the Indians in the West, allowing the railroad corruption to continue. Over the course of Grant's presidency, all of the executive departments came under congressional investigation. <a href="http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=177">Read More...</a> <a href="http://www.socialstudieshelp.com/Lesson_80_Notes.htm">And More...</a> <a href="http://cprr.org/Museum/Credit_Mobilier.html">And More...</a><br /><br />'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood"><strong>Corporate Personhood</strong></a> - The 14th Amendment which was supposed to protect African Americans was ultimately contorted to extend human rights to corporations.

Harding is considered by many to have been even more corrupt than Ulysses S. Grant. The Teapot Dome Scandal, was one of the most embarrassing episodes in U.S. history. In 1921 Secretary of the Interior, Albert B. Fall, a member of Harding's "Ohio Gang" was able to gain control of valuable oil fields in Teapot Dome, Wyoming and Elk Hill, California. These oil fields had been set aside by the government for use by the navy. In 1922, Secretary Fall made a secret deal with two rich oilmen. He gave them a lease to pump oil out of the fields and sell it for themselves. Fall received $325,000 in bonds and cash as well as a large herd of cattle.<br /><br />Another Harding "Ohio Gang" member, Jesse Smith, assistant to Attorney General Harry M. Cramer was exposed as a "bagman" when he was caught carrying bribes to and from the Attorney General's office. Charles Forbes, head of the Veterans Bureau, was convicted of taking at least $250 million dollars in kickbacks and bribes. Charles Cramer, legal advisor to the Veterans Bureau was exposed for taking bribes. Colonel Thomas W. Miller, head of the Office of Alien Property was convicted of fraud. He had sold valuable German patents seized in the first world war for below market price. He too had taken bribes. Through it all only Harding, Calvin Coolidge and a few members of the Cabinet remained in the clear.

But Hitler co-opted the popular socialist movement in Germany just as he co-opted Christianity to gain power. The NAZI Party, which included the words "National Socialist" was a nationalistic flavor that appealed to right-wing conservatives. Hitler often used the words Jews and Democrats interchangeably and the NAZI Party platform was devoted to eliminating liberals. Regardless, everything Hitler did was just a pretext for establishing a Fascist dictatorship.

Hitler chose the symbol of a twisted cross (swastika) from a Christian monastery to represent the twisted Christian views of the Nazi Party.<br /><br />"My feelings as a Christian points me to my Lord and Savior as a fighter. It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded by a few followers, recognized these Jews for what they were and summoned men to fight against them and who, God's truth! was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross. As a Christian I have no duty to allow myself to be cheated, but I have the duty to be a fighter for truth and justice... And if there is anything which could demonstrate that we are acting rightly it is the distress that daily grows.

Roosevelt's New Deal policies conspired to overthrow the government of the United States and install a fascist dictatorship.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.webcom.com/ctka/pr399-fdr.html">The Attempted Coup Against FDR</a><br /><br /><br /><br />In 1933 Major General Smedley Darlington Butler reported to Congress a coup d'etat plot against President Franklin Roosevelt, sponsored by corporate interests. Alarmed by Roosevelt's Democratic "New Deal" which would redistribute wealth from the rich to the poor, Irenee Du Pont, Grayson Murphy, William Doyle, John Davis and other representatives of J.P. Morgan banks, Du Pont, Goodyear and Bethlehem Steel sought to overthrow the U.S. government with a military coup and replace it with a fascist state, based on the recent success of Mussolini and Hitler in Italy and Germany.<br /><br />General Butler was immensely popular with veterans and active troops. As a war hero, twice awarded the Medal of Honor, General Butler was known as "The Fighting Quaker" and a man of unimpeachable honesty and integrity. The conspirators tried to recruit Butler , by promising him an army of 500,000, unlimited financial backing and generous media spin control. The plot was foiled when Butler reported it to Congress.<br /><br />To prevent a panic, Congress whitewashed the public version of its final report, deleting the names of the powerful businessmen whose reputations they sought to protect. The corporate owned media managed to spin the story as rumors and hearsay and the plot was generally covered up for many years.

Smathers invoked the "Red Scare" by calling Pepper "the Red Pepper" and launched a campaign to expose Pepper's secret "vices" disclosing that Pepper was "a known extravert," his sister was a "thespian," and his brother was a "practicing homo sapien." Also, when Pepper went to college, he actually "matriculated." Worst of all, he "practiced celibacy" before marriage. Rural Florida voters were horrified, and Pepper lost.

Kennedy</a><br /><br /><br /><br />One important point that gets lost in all the conspiracy theories about the assassination of John F. Kennedy is the indisputable fact that the FBI did a tremendously terrible job of protecting the president. The evidence being that JFK was actually shot to death in broad daylight, which most people agree with. There were many opportunities for the FBI to prevent the assassination but it just didn't happen.<br /><br />The FBI opened a file on Lee Harvey Oswald when he defected to Russia in 1959. Oswald was interviewed by the FBI when he returned in 1962 with his wife Marina. The FBI knew Oswald was subscribing to Communist publications and joined the Fair Play for Cuba Committee in 1963. The FBI was aware of Oswald's move to New Orleans in August of 1963 where he became involved in both pro and anti Communist activities. They knew he went to Mexico City in September, 1963 to meet with a Soviet KGB officer and tried to meet with Cuban officials. The FBI knew Oswald returned from Mexico to Dallas in early November and got a job at the Texas Book Depository.<br /><br />When Dallas FBI Agent James Hosty interviewed his wife Marina, Oswald went to the FBI building in Dallas and left Hosty a note. The receptionist claimed the note included a threat to "blow up the FBI and the Dallas Police Department if you don't stop bothering my wife." That note should have landed Oswald in jail for life but a few weeks later, after the JFK assassination, Hosty was ordered to destroy the note by his superior Gordon Shanklin. Oswald's address book contained the name and phone number of FBI Agent Hosty. However, the Warren Commission was supplied a typewritten transcript which did not include Hosty's name and phone number. Oswald's letter remained a secret for thirteen years, when someone in the FBI tipped off a journalist about it's existence.<br /><br />How is it possible the all powerful, rabid anti-communist, wire tapping happy, Hoover FBI didn't know exactly what Lee Harvey Oswald was up to, every second of every day? How is it possible the FBI would have allowed the presidents parade route to include that slow dog leg turn down Dealey Plaza right in front of the Book Depository where they knew worked a homicidal nut case? That was some really incredible incompetence.<br /><br />J Edgar Hoover would now work for one of his oldest and closest friends and former neighbor, Lyndon Baines Johnson.

This back fired a little when it was found that Newt had also written a number of overdraft checks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_banking_scandal">Read More...</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/1992/03/18/hous_3.php">Check Scandal Reaches High Into Bush Cabinet</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/political-scandals-of-the-united-states">Political Scandals of the United States</a><br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1359/1261/320/Rove2.jpg" border="0" /><br /><span>1994 </span>- Republican <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Rove">Karl Rove</a> helps George W.

Republican fundraiser Peter W. Smith admitted to paying Arkansas State troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry $6,700 each to smear the reputation of President Bill Clinton. Self described "Conservative Hit Man" David Brock, writing for the Scaife owned American Spectator wrote and broke the story in 1993.<br /><br />In a 1997 Esquire article titled "I Was a Conservative Hit Man" Brock recanted his claims. In 1998 he went further and personally apologized to Clinton. Brock went on to write: "Blinded by the Right: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative" in which he exposed the right-wing conspiracy to destroy Bill and Hillary Clinton and Anita Hill.<br /><br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troopergate">Troopergate</a><br /><a href="http://tinyurl.com/qyljd">Blinded by the Right</a>: The Conscience of an Ex-Conservative<br /><br /><strong>The "Arkansas Project"</strong><br /><br />The "Arkansas Project" funded by billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife, was designed to damage and end the presidency of Bill Clinton through a series of bogus investigations. After wasting more than $25 million of taxpayer money to trump up charges against the Clintons on Whitewater, Troopergate, Travelgate and Filegate the right-wingnuts had to settle with exploiting the fear of Hillary Clinton to trap Bill Clinton into fudging about an affair.<br /><br />February 12, 1999 The Republican controlled Senate acquits President Clinton of all impeachment charges. President Clinton had been asked "have you ever had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, as that term is defined in Deposition Exhibit 1, as modified by the Court." The definition excluded oral sex and President Clinton truthfully answered: "I have never had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky." The founding fathers defined impeachment for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors against the United States."<br /><br />CIA operative Barry Seal came forward to refute the Republican attempt to link Clinton with Pablo Escobar. When in fact the drug ring in question was actually being run as a CIA sting operation and had nothing to do with Clinton.<br /><br />The Arkansas Project smear campaign was amplified by the propaganda organs of the Republican Party including The Washington Times, owned by ultraconservative cult leader Sun Myung Moon, Right-wing propagandist billionaire Rupert Murdoch (FOX News and New York Post) as well as wing nut buffoon, Rush Limbaugh and the Internet gossip column "Drudge Report."<br /><br />During the Clinton presidency the federal budget moved from a quarter-trillion-dollar deficit to a 2 trillion dollar projected surplus. Clinton balanced the US budget, fostered the longest economic expansion in US history, reduced crime and the number of people on welfare. Unemployment dropped from 7.5% to below 4% for the first time in more than 30 years and the Dow Jones rose from 3,200 to a record breaking 10,000.<br /><br /><strong>Sept. 20, 2000</strong> - Independent counsel announces that the Whitewater investigation is closed due to insufficient evidence against the president and first lady.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2001/01/08/politics/main262484.shtml">Clinton Timeline<br /></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkansas_Project">Arkansas Project</a><br /><a href="http://tinyurl.com/ac9ue">The Hunting of the President</a><br /><a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&isbn=0307236897&amp;itm=1">The Republican Noise Machine</a>: Right-Wing Media and How it Corrupts Democracy<br />Republicans launched over 55 official congressional investigations against President Clinton including one investigation on the Clinton family cat "Socks" and12 hours of testimony on the use of the White House Christmas card list.

Rove is also credited with a coordinated stealth campaign of push polling which asks South Carolina voters: "If you knew John McCain fathered an illegitimate black child would you be more or less likely to vote for him?" This was followed up with direct mail and church parking lot flyers to convince voters McCain's adopted Bangladeshi daughter was actually his illegitimate daughter and that his wife was a drug addict. A Bush operative also stole McCain's email lists and directly emails McCain's closest supporters with scandal and lies. Ironically Karl Rove's mentor Lee Atwater, was the political strategist for Strom Thurman, U.S. Senator from South Carolina, who actually did have an illegitimate African American daughter.<br /><br /><img alt="" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1359/1261/320/AlGore.jpg" border="0" />The 2000 presidential campaign was overwhelmed by a smokescreen of suspicion created around Al Gore, designed to demorlize the Democratic base and suppress the overall vote.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.algoresupportcenter.com/goretruth.html#anchor_312">Al Gore Myths Debunked</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/5920188?rnd=1088755502349&has-player=true&amp;version=6.0.8.1024&">The Press vs. Al Gore</a><br /><br /><br />Bush debate material is sent to Al Gore's campaign in an effort to make it appear as if Gore is spying on Bush.

Murdoch-owned New York Post claimed that in 1974 Hillary had called one of her husband's aides "a f#cking Jew bastard." The story was based on a book published by Murdoch-owned HarperCollins, titled State of a Union: Inside the Complex Marriage of Bill and Hillary Clinton.<br /><br />The right-wing media went to town with the story and within hours, it was repeated on CNN, NBC, and of course, Murdoch-owned FOX News. Eventually it was discovered that the source and object of the story was a former Clinton campaign aide named Paul Fray, who was a Baptist and not even Jewish and had lost his law license for taking a bribe. Fray had also written to Mrs. Clinton in 1997, apologizing for calling her names and spreading false stories about her.
