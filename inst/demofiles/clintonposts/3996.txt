I've seen him speak off the cuff a number of times, and he's just so good at connecting.  He's frustrating sometimes, because he goes off message... but he does come across as someone who's pretty honest to the average voter.  He's got the personality to get him through political rough patches. BTW, the ads touting his accomplishments as governor are running again. They're straightforward and for political junkies, maybe pretty boring, but they're effective.  The message is clear and consistent. <br /><blockquote> This winter, Democratic Gov. Ed Rendell was among the incumbents placed on the endangered list by political observers. [...]<br /><br /> That changed after Rendell hit the airwaves, running television commercials across the state touting what he considers the major accomplishments of his first term: job growth, increased investments in education and a balanced budget.<br /><br /> Pollsters started referring to the governor as "Teflon Ed" instead of a vulnerable incumbent.
