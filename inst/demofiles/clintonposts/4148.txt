<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Namche_Bazaar_els_big.jpg"><img vspace="4" hspace="4" align="right" src="http://www.wandertheglobe.com/photos/ultimate/khumbu.jpg" /></a>Like its famous cousin, the <a href="http://ultimateplaces.com/blog/2006/03/12/annapurna-circuit-nepal/">Annapurna Trek</a>, the Khumbu Trek offers passage through a part of the world that nobody should miss if they get a chance. Not everyone might have the will or ability to tackle <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everest">Everest</a>, but with enough desire, I think the Khumbu Trek is open to just about anyone.</p>
<p>The trek these days starts largely in Lukla (after flying in), but if you have more time, you can include the lower half of the trail that Sir Edmund     Hillary followed before his ascent of Everest. This lower segment is known as the Jiri Trail, named after its starting point in the village of Jiri. The trek climbs up through the mountain valleys below Everest with numerous stops along the way including the most famous of which are Namche Bazaar, and Everest Base Camp.</p>
<p>Here is the best <a href="http://www.isu.edu/cwhog/kumboo/TrekMap/trekmap.html">Khumbu trek map</a> I have found online. This <a href="http://ncthakur.itgo.com/map10.htm">map</a> is also worth looking at. It shows the traditional starting point at Jiri.</p>
<p>In addition to Everest, some of the notable mountains along the route include Tramserku, Kongdi Re, Ama Dablam and Kang Taiga.</p>
