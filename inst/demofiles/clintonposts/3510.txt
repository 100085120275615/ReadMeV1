<div>See what happens....Hillary moves in and I become a slacker blogger just like her. It's scary - I can't even begin to imagine what a horrible influence she is going to have on me.<br />
<br />I'm such a bad liar.<br />
<br />Actually, we've just been having too much fun around here to sit down and type.<br />
<br />Yeah, that's a lie too. I've just been lazy.<br />
<br />I've had a few more shifts at my new job - I'm still loving it. I've made a few goofs at the cash, just when cute customers come in- but everyone is being very patient with me. I'm really excited to be in biking distance because I've always wanted to bike to work - but was never able to because I had a Tim-Tag-A-Long.<br />Garnet is doing well getting into the <em>"Dad at home while Mom is working" ---</em> he called me at work to ask where the rice was.....and I had to explain to my co-workers that this was all new to him. But I came home to a yummy plate waiting in the fridge for me. My friend said I should have done this years ago -- since domesticity is not one of Garnet's strengths.<br />
<br />I wrote the best letter of my life to my former employment; <em>"Please accept this as my 2 weeks notice of resignation, I can't wait to get out of here, screw you all, oh and one more thing (as she flips the bird)....."</em>
<br />I used to be scared to write bad things on here about that place - (see Dooce link on the side she lost her job because of her blog) but now I really don't care. Ang, you got out at the right time!! I have 7 works days left. Hallelujah!!<br />
<br />I have more interesting things to write about - our 6 year anniversary is coming up....and we're supposed to be doing some more fun things before summer is over....I'll try not to be so lazy.<br />
<br />xo J</div>
