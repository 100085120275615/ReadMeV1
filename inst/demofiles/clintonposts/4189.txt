<blockquote>In addition to lofty issues of war and peace, the Senate is grappling with another urgent matter: the senators-only elevators at the Capitol are being overrun by the unelected.

<p>âI hesitate to say that itâs a big problem,â said Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, shaking his head gravely. âThere is terrific crowding.â</p>

<p>Mr. Lautenberg, a Democrat who has served more than two decades in the Senate, said he had never seen the Capitol so packed with unelected interlopers.</p>

<p>The crowding extends to the elevators, one of the few sanctuaries available to beleaguered lawmakers as they try to navigate between the Senate chamber, various hearing rooms and offices in the Capitol.</p>

<p>âSometimes you have to shove your way through, push people,â Mr. Lautenberg said.</p>

<p>Add the elevator problem to the litany of senatorial hardships, somewhere between flying coach and the high costs of barbering.</p>

<p>At times, senators even find themselves on public elevators, an ordeal fraught with the possibility of having to push their own buttons (the senators-only elevators usually have attendants).</p>

<p>Worse, senators sometimes share their moving sanctums with staff members, lobbyists and T-shirt-clad tourists who apparently missed (or ignored or cannot read) the senators-only signs.</p>

<p>Or, double-worse, with reporters.</p>

<p>âNo, no, no, câmon, câmon,â Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania complained recently as about 10 reporters trailed his colleague Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York onto a senators-only elevator.</p>

<p>Standing outside the elevator, Mr. Santorum complained that âsome of the rest of usâ need to get on board, too. (He eventually squeezed in.) </p>

<p>Older, tradition-bound Senate veterans â like Ted Stevens of Alaska and Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia â have gained a reputation for hostile glares (or grumbles) when confronted by elevator interlopers.</blockquote></p>

<p>Geez guys. If you're in a hurry, then take the stairs. Afterall, taxpayers are the ones that keep those elevators moving.</p>
