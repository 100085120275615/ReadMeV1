<div align="justify">Displaying their natural tendencies to disregard the security of America in favor of political gain, several prominent Democrats went on record with their opposition to Sen. Bill Frist's bill to criminalize any illegal presence in the US (it is now a civil violation). <a href="http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/newyork/ny-bc-ny--clinton-immigrati0322mar22,0,1122337,print.story?coll=ny-region-apnewyork">Hillary Clinton </a>even invoked the name of "Jesus" and biblical scripture (hear that all you secularists out there) to publicly criticize the bill, surrounded of course by a multitude of brown faces (and potential Hispanic voters). Meanwhile, "Oil Can" Harry Reid threatened to invoke the time-honored Democratic tactic of a "filibuster" to defeat Frist's bill. The bottom line here is obvious. Once again Democrats, desperate for votes, are unwilling to do the right thing when it comes to the security of the United States. After all, how can an "illegal" immigrant "illegally" vote while using his/her "illegally"-obtained identification card if they are not allowed to "illegally" stay in this country in the first place. </div>
