<p>So Hil&#8217;s got a new message&#8230; &#8220;It&#8217;s the American Dream, Stupid!&#8221;Â  First let me mention to Hillary that that is about the dumbest line I have ever heard.Â  It was obnoxious and rude when her loudmouth skirt chasing boor of a husband used it in his campaign, and her latest twist just rams home how dumb she thinks we all are.Â  I honestly thought it was a made up headline when I <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/07/24/hillary.clinton.reut/index.html">saw it on CNN</a> but boy was I wrong.Â  Getting over the fact that I don&#8217;t think she needs to be calling a sitting President &#8220;stupid&#8221;, she could not possibly be more wrong.Â  It&#8217;s not the &#8220;American Dream&#8221; Hil, it&#8217;s the gas pump.Â  And the war.Â  And even something sadly lacking in your house&#8230; values.Â  I don&#8217;t want to be preached to about how terrible you think things are.Â  I want you to tell me what YOU are going to do.Â  God forbid a politician actually do that!
