<div>They say that Arafat will be taken off life support today.  Regardless of the fact that âthe devil you know is better than the devil you donât,â Iâm glad.  Iâm not sure it will further any Israeli/Palestinian peace plan, in fact Iâm pretty sure it wonât.  I am aware that another monster will spring up in his place.  Still, Iâm glad he will die - I only wish it wasnât going to be so easy for him.
<br />
<br />In my frame of reference, Yasser Arafat is the man who invented terrorism.  If nothing else, he invented these so called homicide bombers who terrorize the Israeli people constantly.
<br />
<br />And yet, in many instances, the United States government, under presidents like Bill Clinton, has embraced him.  Officials like Madeline Albright, Hillary Clinton vied for his favor, maybe he has a way with women.  Under democratic presidents, a terrorist, similar to the ones who crashed into the WTC, has dined in the White House.  I find that disgusting.
<br />
<br />I donât think any president has had a clear view of the issues between Palestine and Israel, including Bush 43.  I donât think he realizes the level of hatred involved.  The Palestinians (not that I think I can speak for all Palestinians) donât want a separate, independent state.  They want the Jews forced into the sea.  Fortunately the Israeli Defense has something to say about that.
<br />
<br />[To go off on a separate tangent, next time you hear someone whining about a possible draft, that is not going to happen, remind them that in Israel, upon graduating high school, all Israelis (men and women) go directly into armed services for, I believe, two years.  Could this be a reason that the Israelis have managed to ward off Arab/Muslim foes for the last 56 years?  They know what they stand to lose if they donât fight, I wonder if we will ever understand that.]
<br />
<br />As I wind through this topic of Arafatâs death, I end up somewhere completely different.  The idea of life and when it begins.  I have one child, I have been pregnant more than one time - come to your own conclusions.  As I find myself moving to the right, I struggle with the issue of choice and life.  When did Charlotte begin to be Charlotte?  Was it in the fourth month, when her brain started developing faster?  (In CA an abortion can be had easily up to the end of the first 12 weeks.)  Or was it as soon as the two cells that would eventually become Charlotte met?
<br />
<br />I guess I believe that women should have the right to choose and control what happens to their body.  The issue that I take with our current situation is that there is virtually no responsibility placed on the parties that created the life that they now intend to end.  I know how easy it is to get pregnant and I know how hard it is to be a parent.  When it first happens, thereâs just this little cellular mass in your tummy and itâs easy to discount its future.  Itâs not hard to put out of your mind that this little cellular mass will end up being a person, with feelings, thoughts and a smile that will melt your heart.  So you just make an appointment with PP or through your ob/gyn and âget it taken care of.â
<br />
<br />But as I look at the possibilities for Charlotteâs life, I wonder about the possibilities for the unborn, literally and hypothetically.  I truly believe that in some way, my daughter will have an impact on this world.  For her the possibilities are limitless.   What of that life (those millions of lives) that was (were) âtaken care ofâ [how backwards is that - youâre not taking care of anything but yourself?] could they have done any of the wonderful things that we dream of, if only they had lived.
<br />
<br />So for me the answer is, the choice should be there, but so should the consequences.  People need to be made to understood what they are doing.  They should not be able to put it out of their mind.  There should be more opportunities for adoption [something I could never have done, carrying a baby for 9 mos and giving it up] and there should certainly be more education on how not to get pregnant, because its just as easy to not get pregnant as it is to get pregnant.</div>
