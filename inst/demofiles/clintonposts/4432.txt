<p>Chuck Schumer could not be denied another opportunity to <a href="http://www.commonvoice.com/article.asp?colid=5292">lambast </a>the Bush administration - this time through FEMA over the weekend. <br />
<blockquote><br />
Schumer lambasted FEMA -- one of the Democrats' favorite bogeyman -- for only approving eight of thirteen counties impacted by the deadly storm.  He urged the Bush administration to have FEMA,  the Department of Agriculture, Small Business Administration and the Department of Transportation to help the hardest hit areas simultaneously.</p>

<p>During his assessment tour accompanied by Sen. Hillary Clinton, New York's junior senator, Schumer said they âwill be the monkey[s] on FEMAâs back."</blockquote></p>

<p>I didn't see the news conference, but I think Schumer and Clinton have been monkies on the backs of a lot of entities. </p>
