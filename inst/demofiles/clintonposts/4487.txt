<p>Has it really been a week since I posted?</p>
<p>I think the cease-fire between Hezbollah and Israel is a mistake.  I think Pat Buchanan&#8217;s new book that western civilization is inflammatory but has a lot of truth.  I think scientist that predicted a very active hurricane season ought to be brought to prime-time television, admit they really had no idea and they were trying to either increase newspaper sales or make a name for themselves, and then fired.  I think there are a lot of holes in John Karr&#8217;s story but he&#8217;s been given way too much media for his confession of killing Jon Benet Ramsey.  I think Time Magazine putting Hillary Clinton&#8217;s picture on the front and declaring &#8220;She&#8217;s Ready to Run&#8221; isn&#8217;t news and shows their left-wing bias.  I think the Democrats are making a serious strategic error by alienating their base in New Hampshire.  I think I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t see &#8220;Snakes on a Plane&#8221; after the reviews this morning.</p>
<p>Other than that, not a whole lot of opinions on this side of the monitor.  How about you?  Give me a 1-sentence opinion on any topic you wish and tell me your opinion.  Supporting facts aren&#8217;t necessary, it&#8217;s just your opinion.</p>
<p>What is your opinion?
