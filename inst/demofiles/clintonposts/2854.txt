<div>A new Quinnipiac poll shows Ned Lamont ahead of incumbent Senator Joe Lieberman (D-CT) with just days to go before the CT primary. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/114/story/467318.html">According to the AP</a>, <em>"Senator Lieberman's campaign bus seems to be stuck in reverse," poll director Douglas Schwartz said. "Despite visits from former President Bill Clinton and other big-name Demo-crats, Lieberman has not been able to stem the tide to Lamont."</em>

<br />I don't care how you feel about Joe Lieberman, I continue to think this makes no sense whatsoever.  Every penny spent on defeating Lieberman is a penny less spent on booting folks like morally bankrupt Charles Taylor.  Whether we like it or not, it is a zero sum game.  There are limited resources and the Lamont - Lieberman race is a drain on those limited resources. <br />
<br />Worse, should Lamont actually pull this off on Tuesday, Lieberman will file to run as an independent and the endangered CT 3 (Republican House Reps Shays, Simmons, and Johnson) will rush to endorse Lieberman.  An independent Lieberman candidacy ensures that the CT 3 look like real moderates and ensures that CT Democratic money is spent on a nasty 3 way Senate race, rather than on defeating the CT 3.<br />
<br />Some times what feels good isn't what makes sense.</div>
