In alphebetical order they are: Allard (R-CO), Allen (R-VA), Bayh (D-IN), Burr (R-NC), Coburn (R-OK), Conrad (D-ND), DeMint (R-SC), DeWine (R-OH), Feingold (D-WI), Graham (R-SC), Kyl (R-AZ), Landrieu (D-LA), Sessions (R-AL)Sununu (R-NH), Vitter (R-LA). </span></div><div align="left"><span></span></div><div align="left"><span>Among the most troubling patterns of the Bush presidency has been his penchant for big spending. One of the most dramatic changes in perception toward the two main political parties that I've observed in my lifetime has been the transition engineered by the Clinton administration that has persuaded the public that Democrats are more competent to manage the economy than Republicans. I've written about Bush's economic policies on numerous occasions and recently linked to a hard hitting <strong>Peggy Noonan</strong> editorial (</span><a href="http://snipurl.com/ituy"><span>http://snipurl.com/ituy</span></a><span>). Ms. Noonan was a special assistant to President Reagan and a speech writer for the president's father when he was running for president. She's a member of the team. Of our current president's fiscal policies she writes:</span><br /></div><blockquote><span>George W. Bush is a big spender. He has never vetoed a spending bill. When Congress serves up a big slab of fat, crackling pork, Mr. Bush responds with one big question: Got any barbecue sauce? The great Bush spending spree is about an arguably shrewd but ultimately unhelpful reading of history, domestic politics, Iraq and, I believe, vanity. </span></blockquote><div align="left"><span>Of course, things have lately come to a head between fiscal conservatives and the administration. Not only are big government adversaries unhappy with the president, they are unhappy with both houses of the legislature. In that same editorial, Noonan put it this way:</span> </div><blockquote><span>Republicans have grown alarmed at federal spending. It has come to a head not only because of Katrina but because of the huge pork-filled highway bill the president signed last month, which comes with its own poster child for bad behavior, the Bridge to Nowhere. The famous bridge in Alaska that costs $223 million and that connects one little place with two penguins and a bear with another little place with two bears and a penguin. The Bridge to Nowhere sounds, to conservative ears, like a metaphor for where endless careless spending leaves you. From the Bridge to the 21st Century to the Bridge to Nowhere: It doesn't feel like progress. </span><br /></blockquote><blockquote><p><span>A lot of Bush supporters assumed the president would get serious about spending in his second term. With the highway bill he showed we misread his intentions. </span></p></blockquote><div align="left"><span>One Republican Senator, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, had the courage to confront the very project Peggy Noonan cited, the Bridge to Nowhere. Coburn put up a proposal to eliminate some $450 million in federal funds for two Alaskan bridges and shift $75 million to a Louisiana bridge damaged by Hurricane Katrina. In so doing, the Obstetrician-turned-politician stepped on some toes. </span><br /></div><blockquote><p><span>"I've been here now almost 37 years," said Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska and the projects' chief advocate. "This is the first time I have seen any attempt of any senator to treat my state in a way different from any other state."</span></p><p><span>"I don't kid people," Stevens shouted indignantly. "If the Senate decides to discriminate against our state . . . I will resign from this body."</span></p></blockquote><div align="left"><span>An AP story today(</span><a href="http://snipurl.com/itvi"><span>http://snipurl.com/itvi</span></a><span>) reports on the outcome of the Senate's consideration of Coburn's proposal:</span> </div><blockquote><p><span>The dispute temporarily brought the Senate to a halt as Republican and Democratic leaders sought to intercede between Stevens, the Senate Pro Tempore who is renowned for winning projects for his state, and Coburn, who was elected to the Senate last year on a platform of slashing the size of government and ending old-school porkbarrel spending.</span></p><p><span>The Senate later rejected the Coburn measure, 82-15.</span></p></blockquote><div align="left"><span>The Senate did in fact vote on Coburn's proposal and in so doing provided a moment of clarity to conservatives. As John Hinderaker of <strong>Powerline</strong> put it (</span><a href="http://snipurl.com/itvm"><span>http://snipurl.com/itvm</span></a><span>):</span></div><blockquote><span>So now we know: there are only fifteen members of the Senate who are unwilling to waste the taxpayers' money on even the most frivolous of projects. Let's see what we can do about the other 82.</span></blockquote>
