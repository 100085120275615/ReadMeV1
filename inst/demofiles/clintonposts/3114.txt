<div>Here's a great article from today's New York Post:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>February 16, 2006 -- HERE'S a philosophical question: Isn't creating a wax<br />figure of Hillary Clinton just a wee bit redundant?</p>
<p> In her robin's-egg blue pantsuit, strenuously coiffed hair, and a smile plastered on her puss that says, "Don't eff with me, buddy," Her Hillaryness serves as inspiration for the newest dummy to grace Madame Tussaud's in Midtown. </p>
<p>All of which makes me wonder: How can you tell the real one from the fake? </p>
<p>And, perhaps more importantly: Is there really much difference?<br />I got a sneak peek at the brand-new and totally unauthorized wax sculpture of Hillary, to be unveiled today at a mock Hillary 2008 political rally - just in time for Presidents Day. </p>
<p>
<br />Get it? </p>
<p>
<br />Now, I've met the former and wannabe future White House tenant on many<br />occasions over the years. And I've studied and absorbed her shtick with equal<br />parts fascination and revulsion, bordering on scary obsession.<br />
<br />My, how she's grown! When Hillary first shot out of husband Bill's shadow, lusting for political power, she was a painfully stiff, but hardworking, speaker with lousy<br />hair and leftist ideals. </p>
<p>
<br />Now she's developed into a painfully stiff, but<br />hardworking, speaker with world-class hairstylists and center-right ideals that<br />poll well in red states. Still, it came as a shock to enter Tussaud's<br />gallery - where, I swear, a sculpture of Yasser Arafat was breathing - and see<br />Hillary looking as if a butter pat would turn to ice in her mouth. </p>
<p>
<br />They've got her down. </p>
<p>
<br />The generous hips. The perma-grin. And teeth - the perfect<br />shade of ecru. Her teeth are of a color that says, "Like so many Americans, I do<br />not have dental insurance. But if you elect me president..." </p>
<p>
<br />Even her recent political switcheroo is made clear. She is flanked to the right by a statue of a scowling George W. Bush, and to the left by a painfully thin version of her<br />hubby. </p>
<p>
<br />Hillary leans in Bush's direction. She can't seem to get away from Bill quickly enough.<br />Yet, the woman who rode into office posing as a victim<br />is wearing a wedding band. Bill is not. The resemblance is all the more<br />astonishing because Hillary did not pose for the statue. Her office sent a<br />letter, saying that her schedule was just too busy, said Tussaud's general<br />manager Janine DiGioacchino. The artisans who crafted her head and hands from<br />wax, her body from fiberglass, worked for six months from photos and video. Is<br />the country ready for Hillary? Patrons can cast their votes on two questions:<br />Would you ever vote for a female president? (Correct answer: Yes.) </p>
<p>
<br />And: Will Hillary Clinton be the first female president? (I'm leaving.) </p>
<p>
<br />Joe Merenda, who came from Perth, Australia, on his honeymoon with wife Lisa, said he'd vote for Hillary because he thinks she's hot. Yet Bush is his political idol.<br />
</p>
<p>"Hillary is awesome!" enthused Samantha Kaplan, 13, from - where else? - the<br />Upper West Side. </p>
<p>
<br />I'm waiting for Hillary (the real one) to come alive. This statue has more blood flowing in its veins. </p>
