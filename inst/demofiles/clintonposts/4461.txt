<p>Ever walked into a mirror and not realized you were walking into yourself at the time? A few years ago I was in Abercrombie and Fitch on a Friday afternoon babbling on the phone and stepped into a full length mirror sending the slap of body meets surface soaring through the store.  The men my eyes were hitched on looked dead with amusement at one another,</p>

<p>Hot Guy 1:  âDid you just see that?â<br />
Hot Guy 2: âThat was awesome.â</p>

<p>Backing away from the mirror while hiding my own giggle, I quickly left the store.  </p>

<p>Iâve met several in my life and sensed this feeling of smacking into myself or a reflection of me I knew before taking in the experience. When I met my best friend from high school, <a href="http://sassysuspect.com/archives/2005/07/now.php">Tiffany</a>, we caught eyes at an afterschool club meeting instantly knowing we were bound by time and circumstance.  <a href="http://sassysuspect.com/archives/2005/08/ode_to_f.php">Ronda and I met under estranged conditions</a>, no man could come between us, our bond was instantaneous.  Years before I met Soleil those close to me assumed we knew one another, âYa know Soleil.â </p>

<p>J:  âNo, Iâve never met Soleil.â   </p>

<p>And now my Mother says, âYouâve been friends with Soleil for a long time.â My only reply is, âWell, Momâ¦..its SO-lei.â </p>

<p> I answer as if thereâs never been a question with all these ladies each time she brings this up.  The friendship is bound in a time where hour glasses donâtâ exist.  We see only wrinkles, laughter, tears, an ability to take the good, bad, and understand the otherâs personalities while knowing their reactions prior to their performance.<br />

Iâve been blessed, not in a holier than though way, in the past two years Iâve met several others Iâve felt this way about.  Four, <a href="http://sassysuspect.com/archives/2006/02/fall_out_boy.php">Kendra</a>, <a href="http://sassysuspect.com/archives/2006/02/blonde_champagn.php">Alison</a>, <a href="http://sassysuspect.com/archives/2006/04/the_way_it_shou_2.php">Reagan</a>, <a href="http://angelwithanattitude.typepad.com/">Wendi</a>, I met through this silly web site.  Kristina & Hillary through Soleil, Cathy & Darren by random chance at a (cough) âfriendsâ house party, Kim walked into Cathyâs bridal shower â within two minutes we were friendsâ¦the same with Kimâs BFF Celeste,  Britney & Aubrey through Hillary, and Aparna & Agnes I literally bumped into on the dance floor and quickly began sharing random jokes with about those around us.  These are my closest gals; weâll get to my guys later.  </p>

<p>Alison and I discuss her Mother, loss of her Father, importance of friends,and everything in between. Ronda tells the story of her ex-husband and settling into Happy.  Tiffany tells a story of her amazing son and ability to leave an abusive relationship, Soleil and I discuss her family & her (newly)  finding Happy, Reagan discusses heartache & pushing past it, Cathy, Darren, & I talk about settling into their new life, Wendi & Hillary discuss being single and finding a belonging professionally, Britney and I â¦.well â we mostly make fun of Aubrey (kidding Aubs), Agnes and I joke about me being âThe New Jessica Nick Lachey canât get over.â Kendra, Aparna, Kim, Celeste and I discuss all of the above with some random stories involving pizza and âMIAâ thrown in on the weekends next to happenstance...and Ashley.  </p>

<p>Each of these ladies laid a path whether they know it or not, they are more than dynamic conversations.  Sometimes itâs more about whatâs not said, than the spoken word.  </p>

<p>Maybe our brains arenât hardwired to have all these experiences, but to walk through them with those around us.  </p>

<p>To those i left out - it's only because I'm tired and you already know.</p>

<p>All My Love.</p>
