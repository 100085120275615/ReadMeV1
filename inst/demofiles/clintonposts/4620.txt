<p>It looks like it's time for Hillary to unleash a <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/08/14/D8JGI7C80.html">"placate the kooks" moment.</a></p>

<p>  <blockquote>Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, a possible contender for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination in 2008, on Monday criticized the Bush administration for failing to do enough to protect the country from terrorists.</p>

<p>Clinton's comments came after authorities in the United Kingdom last week said they thwarted a terror plot involving airplanes bound from Britain to the United States. Conspirators allegedly planned to blow up as many as 10 planes flying from Britain to the United States using liquid explosives, which the U.S. Transportation Security Administration's security equipment cannot detect in carry-on luggage.</p>

<p>"We've done some things right," the New York senator said at a community event in Schenectady. "Obviously we've beefed up airport security in some ways, but as we've learned over the last week not in every way that matters. We still have not done what we need to do to protect our ports, our borders, our bridges, our transit systems, our rail lines, it's a long list."</p>

<p>"I don't think our long-term strategy for homeland security is yet what it needs to be," she said. </blockquote></p>

<p>Oh really? Well now's the time for you and the rest of your party to sit down and tell us your plan Senator. This is all we ever hear from Democrats. We never see them have the guts to present their supposedly better ideas. It shows just how rudderless the party is at this moment in time.</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is an instance of Hillary trying to placate the kook Daily Chaos(Kos)crowd. Especially with this typical leftist style comment.</p>

<blockquote> "What sense does it make to cut anti-terrorism funding to New York by 40 percent but give tax cuts to billionaires who live in New York City?" she said.</blockquote>

<p>The typical class envy line, right out of the old playbook. She knows well enough now that she needs to court the kooks for 2008. Look for more of this in the coming weeks, especially if Lamont is able to get a lead on Lieberman.</p>
