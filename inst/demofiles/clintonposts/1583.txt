<p>&#8220;Have you ever heard Rush talk about McCain. With all the ditto heads running around out there I see no way McCain get the nomination. Hillary maybe(I hope not), but not McCain. Unless he kisses RushÃ¢&#x20AC;&#x2122;s ass well enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry but any time I hear Coulter or Rush being held in such high esteem I just roll my eyes and laugh. I really feel badly for these poor idiots who listen to his show and truly believe that he is a good reference to cite. AND they actually believe that they belong to some gigantic club of Rush listeners who are a secret force to be reckoned with. Reality check: Rush is a wacko who preys on the weak-minded, paranoid delusions of the less intelligent people who have nothing better to do in the late morning than listen to a fat drug addict teach morality - that is, why it is ok to have none.</p>
<p>After putting &#8220;Rush Limbaugh audience numbers&#8221; in Google I found this as well as tons of similar critiques:</p>
<p>&#8220;Rush Limbaugh claims he has an audience of 20 million listeners. Very impressive.</p>
<p>So Limbaugh has an audience of 20 million.</p>
<p>20 million is a lot of people right? Yes and it would be even more impressive if 20 million people actually listened to Rush Limbaugh. Fortunately they don&#8217;t. Let&#8217;s take a look at how they arrived at 20 million in the first place. You&#8217;ll see that just like most of Limbaugh&#8217;s preachings, his ratings are a little slight of hand, some outright falsehoods, and a whole lot of twisting the facts to fit his claims.</p>
<p>Limbaugh&#8217;s 20 million is the total number of possible listeners for a week. If you listen closely they actually say he reaches an audience of 20 million people every week. So does NPR but does that mean all 20 million are actually listening? Obviously not. Just because you can reach an audience with your signal doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;ll actually tune you in.</p>
<p>Just for fun, give Rush the benefit of the doubt here. Let&#8217;s say his total number of listeners in a week is actually 20 million people. Very impressive again right? Not so fast. That total is what is simply the number of people who tuned him in at one point or another during a week. That means that they added up the numbers from every show for a week and the total is where they got the 20 million. So in reality all the nut jobs that listen to him every day were counted 5 times in his weekly total. It does not mean by any definition that 20 million separate people listened to his show during a week. It simply means that the same people who listen over and over were counted 5 times. Imagine if we could find a way to make our vote count 5 times. </p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s break it down some more. Of the total listeners every day. Many of them may have only listened for 5-10 minutes or what is known as a quarter-hour. Doesn&#8217;t matter. They count towards the total. So now we have people who are listening for a few minutes being thrown into this very impressive total. They aren&#8217;t listening from 12 to 3 every day. They simply show up as a listener for at least 15 minutes. Now if you listen for only 30 seconds but you write it down in your little Arbitron diary guess what, Rush Limbaugh picks up another quarter- hour. A person literally could have been listening by accident but they just happened to be an honest diary keeper and Rush gets their rating. Takes some of the shine off the whole thing don&#8217;t you think?</p>
<p>The real number you want to look at is called the AQH. That is the Average Quarter Hour. That is where you might get a better idea of how many people are actually listening to Limbaugh. And the AQH will give you the true size of his audience.</p>
<p>The AQH is the number of people listening during any quarter-hour of Limbaugh&#8217;s show. That&#8217;s the true audience and I promise you it&#8217;s not 20 million. Not even close. It might be 3 million and that&#8217;s pushing it. Still those are truly great numbers in Radio. Trust me, there are radio people out there who would sacrifice their family to a volcano for an AQH of 3 million. But it&#8217;s hardly the 20 million that Big Fat Rush would have you think it is.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s break it down some more. Limbaugh is on about 640 stations. So let&#8217;s take the AQH rating and see where we really are in terms of audience size.</p>
<p>3 million actual listeners divided by 640 stations. That comes out to 4687.5 listeners per station. Obviously that isn&#8217;t how it works but that is the average number of listeners per station. Clearly a station in Cleveland will have a much larger total than one in Auburn, NY just because the markets are so different in size but you get the gist.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t even go into the details of how incredibly flawed and unreliable radio research is. I&#8217;ll just say that it would get laughed out of any sociology convention. The participants are about as reliable as Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s facts which is to say not very.</p>
<p>After further review and a little scrutiny it seems that Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s ratings and his alleged audience of 20 million are a lot like Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s show. Big and blustery but unable to withstand scrutiny of any kind. Simply stated, he lies about his ratings just like he lies about most everything else.</p>
<p>He may even have an audience of 3 million but all that means is that 272 million people AREN&#8217;T listening to him.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, ditto-heads, I fail to see any threat from your &#8220;movement&#8221; - just the exploitation of the fear that electing any democrat will bring about Armageddon.<br />
