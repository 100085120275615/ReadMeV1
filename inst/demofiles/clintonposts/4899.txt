<p>With just a few weeks to Primary Day, most Maryland politicians were packed into the small strip of honky tonk, miniature golf and beach resorts that is Ocean City.</p>

<p>Not present for the Maryland Association of Counties conference here, though, was Lt. Gov. <a href="http://www.michaelsteeleformaryland.com">Michael Steele</a>, the Republican who is seeking a seat in the U.S. Senate this fall. But that didn't mean Steele wasn't a presence here anyway.</p>

<p>Democratic frontfunner and U.S. Rep. <a href="http://www.bencardin.com">Ben Cardin </a>maintained a packed schedule of stops in and around Ocean City, telling a group gathered for the conference that his wife advised him to remember the event is bipartisan.</p>

<p>"She told me, 'Please don't say anything nasty about Republicans.' And I said, 'I don't need to do that; Michael Steele's done a pretty good job of that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/26/AR2006072601740.html">himself</a>!'"</p>

<p>Down the road, Steele's political partner, Gov. <a href="http://www.bobehrlich.com">Robert L. Ehrlich Jr</a>., had his back. As Ehrlich spoke to a crowded bar, filled with his campaign loyalists, he advised everyone to work hard for Steele's Senate bid.</p>

<p>"Michael Steele, he's going to be our next United States senator," Ehrlich said. "Wait 'till Hillary meets <em>him</em>!"</p>
