<p><strong>Rolex Replica Watches</strong></p>
<p>When most people think of fine or exclusive timepieces, the Rolex name quickly comes to mind. Since the companyâs founding in 1908, Rolex has made a name for itself through its technological innovation, meticulous craftsmanship, and classic and enduring style. To this day, a Rolex watch represents the pinnacle of quality and luxury.</p>
<p>A major factor in Rolexâs continued success and popularity is the distinct and classic styling of the Rolex watch line. Most Rolex models can be characterized by a large, round watch face and a wide band. This design is instantly recognizable to anyone who is familiar with fine timepieces.</p>
<p>Being a privately held company, Rolex is able to shy away from fads in the timepiece industry. While other manufacturers moved to quartz designs, Rolex stuck to its guns and continued to make mechanical watches. Rolex has consciously stayed away from strange case designs and trendy timepiece complications; no Rolex watch should appear dated in a decade or two.</p>
<p>Today, Rolex watches are associated with success and class. These quality timepieces can be seen on the wrists of executives, high-ranking pubic servants, movie stars, and even royalty all over the world. Those who wear Rolex watches do so not because Rolex is the most expensive timepiece manufacturer, but because they understand and appreciate the history, enduring style, and commitment to quality that goes into every Rolex timepiece. When those who can have any timepiece consistently put Rolex at the top of their list, that is an amazing testament to the allure of Rolexâs beautiful timepieces.<a id="more-116"></a></p>
<p><strong>Rolex Replica Watches - A Brief History</strong></p>
<p>Rolex was founded in 1908 by a German, Hans Wilsdorf. In the beginning, the company was called Wilsdorf &#038; Davis, the Davis coming from the name of Wilsdorfâs partner. At this time, Swiss watch makers primarily made pocked watches, as producing watch movements small enough for wrist watches was very difficult. Through intense work and well-selected partnerships, Wilsdorf was able to develop his first wrist watch designs by 1910. These wrist watch movements were sent to the prestigious School of Horology in Switzerland and were awarded the worldâs first chronometer rating for a wrist watch.</p>
<p>After tackling accuracy, Wilsdorfâs next challenge was to improve wrist watch reliability. He accomplished this through the development of the screw down crown and caseback. These developments were enormous breakthroughs for Rolex. Wilsdorf termed these advancements the Rolex Oyster after having difficulty with prying open on oyster at a dinner party. These developments allowed Rolex to build the worldâs first waterproof watch. Rolex advertised these watches to a skeptical public by displaying the watches suspended in aquariums in shop windows.</p>
<p>Rolexâs next major breakthrough was in 1931 when it developed the âRotor.â The Rotor was a tiny metal plate that, with gravity, would automatically wind the watch as the wearer moved. The gave birth to Rolexâs Perpetual movement.</p>
<p>Rolex went on to use its Perpetual movement in a vast array of watches. Rolexes have survived the summit of Mt. Everest with Sir Edmund Hillary and the depths of the ocean with diver Jacques Piccard. Rolex Oyster Perpetual watches have broken the sound barrier and even been in outer space. These accomplishments truly are a testament to Rolexâs amazing ruggedness and quality craftsmanship.</p>
<p>After marrying a British woman and living in Geneva for 40 years, Wilsdorf died in 1960. Today, Rolexâs legacy lives in its amazing collection of timepieces.</p>
<p>Rolex watches are in the upper echelon of timepieces. The company, its products, and its brand name have ranked among the watch-making elite for more than a century, since Hans Wildorf first started his watch distributing company in London in 1905. Over the years, Rolex received the first chronometer certification, designed the first waterproof watch case that was endorsed by adventurers and explorers, and designed the first automatic winding mechanism to be found in a watch&#8211;among many other achievements.</p>
<p>These accomplishments allowed Rolex watches to set the standard for precision and luxury, which they continue to do today. Their Oyster collection has continued to evolve since it was first worn while a swimmer crossed the English Channel; and this line of distinctive watches has been worn by adventurers and professionals alike. Superior reliability is not the only trademark of Rolex watches; all of their collections, such as the Cellini, are aesthetically stunning.</p>
<p>If you want to purchase a watch with a design that has been rigorously tested to last for years, Rolex watches will not disappoint you. Each watch must pass tests for ten different criteria before it is sold. From the waterproofing techniques pioneered by Rolex, to the use of only the finest metals and stones, as well as unrelenting testing by an independent Swiss organization, each chronograph carries with it the legacy that Rolex has built for the last century.</p>
<p>Rolex is endorsed publicly by several individuals who embody &#8220;the constant pursuit of perfection.&#8221; Musical greats such as Yo Yo Ma and Eric Clapton, explorers such as Sir Edmund Hillary, and tennis players such as Andy Roddick all wear their Rolexes proudly. Rolex&#8217;s ambassadors come from all realms, demonstrating the versatility and timelessness of the Rolex image. From the concert hall to the race track, you will find Rolex watches on the wrists of spectators and participants alike.</p>
<p><strong>Rolex Watches Pre-Owned</strong></p>
<p>History of the Wristwatch: The history of the wristwatch is indeed short. Wristwatches did not begin to see widespread use until the 1920s. Men tended to regard the Rolex Watches Pre-Owned as effeminate. So, the vintage Rolex men&#8217;s watch is a relatively rare timepiece.</p>
<p>Watches adapted to the wrist made sporadic appearances as early as the late 1500s. Queen Elizabeth I is said to have been given one. In the early 1800s the wristwatch made more frequent appearances when jewelry and watchmakers began creating gem encrusted timepieces for royalty.</p>
<p>Impact of War: Toward the end of the 1800s, women began to embrace the Rolex Watches Pre-Owned as an item of adornment. Despite the feminine association, the concept became accepted as indispensable to military campaigns as mechanization in war grew. The ability to read time with a quick glance rather than having to dig through pockets was critical in battle.</p>
<p>Officers in the South African Boer war (1899-1902) used wristwatches. By World War I, military organizations began to demand them. They became especially crucial to fledgling aerial combat operations.</p>
<p>As demand for heart rate monitor watches in warfare grew, rugged timepieces covered with metal grids were introduced. The first chronograph wristwatches were developed, and luminous hands and markers were developed.</p>
<p>Between the Wars: Following the war, automatic (self winding) wristwatches were created, drawing on technology used in pocket watches. Initially they were unreliable, but were perfected by the late 1930s and early 1940s. In the 1920s, the wristwatch became the dominant means of timekeeping among both men and women. Then, as now, men seemed to prefer more rugged, sportier models, including chronographs. Rolex created the first Rolex Watches Pre-Owned which was worn unscathed by a woman channel swimmer in 1927. Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart strapped on wristwatches for their celebrated flights.</p>
<p>During the Great Depression, demand for wristwatches withered and many top watchmaking companies went out of business. Despite reversals, many design innovations were introduced. With the advent of World War II, watches in most countries were an unattainable luxury and production ceased for all but military needs.
