<div><p>It's no secret that we at Mazurland would never want to see Hillary Clinton as president. But after reading <a href="http://news.bostonherald.com/columnists/view.bg?articleid=151737">this article</a>, I'm realizing the same may be true for many Democrats:</p>

<p><em>"'Lying b**** . . . shrew . . . Machiavellian . . . evil, power-mad witch . . . the ultimate self-serving politician.'</em></p>

<p><em>No prizes for guessing which presidential front-runner drew these remarks in focus groups.<br />
 <br />
But these werenât Republicans talking about Hillary Clinton. They werenât even independents.<br />
 <br />
These were ordinary, grass-roots Democrats. People who identified themselves as 'likely' voters in the pivotal stateâs Democratic primary. And, behind closed doors, this is what nearly half of them are saying...</em></p>

<p><em>Hillaryâs growing brain trust in the partyâs upper reaches already knows she has high ânegativesâ among ordinary Democrats. They think she can win those voters over with the right strategy and message. </em></p>

<p><em>But they should get out of D.C., New York and L.A. more often, and visit grassroots members. </em></p>

<p><em>Because weâre not talking about âsoftâ negatives like, say, 'out of touch' or 'arrogant.'<br />
 <br />
Weâre talking: âCriminal . . . megalomaniac . . . fraud . . . dangerous . . . devil incarnate . . . satanic . . . power freak.'<br />
 <br />
Satanic.<br />
 <br />
And: 'Political wh***.'"</em> </p>

<p>OK, we conservatives simply want what's best for the country. That's why we root for someone like Joe Lieberman against the MoveOn-funded peacenik, Ned Lamont, in today's <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/output/elect/cst-nws-lieb08.html">Connecticut primary</a>, despite the fact that keeping Lieberman around probably benefits the Democratic Party. But is it so wrong to wish Hillary at <em>least</em> wins the Democratic nomination? She would provide endless viewing pleasure as she is torn apart from all sides as she tries to straddle every issue. And on the slim chance she actually takes a firm stance on an issue, the resulting debate would be illuminating, and benefit all.</p>

<p>Don't self destruct so fast, Hillary! Damn, I'm already starting to miss her...</p></div>
