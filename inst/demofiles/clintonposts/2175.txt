<div>The sculpture "<a href="http://museumofsex.com/exhibitions/hillary/index.html">The Presidential Bust of Hillary Rodham Clinton: the First Woman President of the United States of America</a>" sits on display at the <a href="http://www.museumofsex.com/">Museum of Sex</a> in New York August 9, 2006. Artist Daniel Edwards claims to have been inspired to make the piece after actress Sharon Stone said Clinton could never be president because she is a sexual being.<br />
