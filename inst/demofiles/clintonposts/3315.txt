<div>It seems easy in today's political climate of cynicism, distrust, and anger to forget to sit back and be thankful.<br />
<br />Like so many of my fellow Americans, I am just a few generations removed from the poor immigrants who left everything they knew for the chance at a better life in America. America fulfilled its promise to them. Rich and poor, Republican and Democrat, we are united not by our ancestry, social class, or even our English language, but by a commitment to set of ideals. One grandfather, a lifelong liberal, helped fight Nazi Germany during World War II. He helped liberate the concentration camp <a href="http://www.kz-gedenkstaette-dachau.de/englisch/content/">
<span>Dachau</span>
</a>, and was held as a prisoner of war. My other grandfather, a Clinton-hating Republican, fought in the Korean War where he survived his ship being sunk.<br />
<br />America has always been an imperfect experiment in liberty for sure. Our history is checkered with national sins that we should all be ashamed of, slavery and its legacy of racism surely one of the greatest failures. But we have pressed on. Today America is the great superpower. No country has even comparable economic or military power. And this is no accident.<br />
<br />I love America. There is no place I'd rather live, even if Hillary Clinton is elected our next President! This is a great country with unprecedented opportunity and freedom. In the midst of our sour national mood, let's not forget who we are and where we've come from. May God continue to bless the United States of America.</div>
