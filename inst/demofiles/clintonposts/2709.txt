<div><p>Good day to all and thank you for coming to visit the 131st Carnival of the Vanities, begun by the gifted and talented progenitor Bigwig at <a href="http://silflayhraka.blogspot.com/">Siflay Hraka</a>.</p>

<p>If you see smoke emanating from this blog site it is because of quite a controversy that has been roiling CodeBlueBlog this week, and I apologize if this gets in your way...but the show must go on!</p>

<p></p>

<p><span><strong><u>The Top Story -- And Breaking News:</u></strong></span></p>

<p>Looking for the next blogger to break out into <em>national attention</em> with cutting edge material BEFORE the MSM? Eric McErlain of <a href="http://offwing.com/">Off Wing Opinion</a> is my bet. The rubric is sports, but the information is erudite and insightful... and I think he just landed a <em>blue marlin</em>:</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.ericmcerlain.com/offwingopinion/archives/004646.php#004646">Title IX Earthquake</a>, Eric blows the doors off a story not yet read or reported in MSM --It's about a change in enforcement of the controversial Title IX rule. Go read it.</p>

<p>TOP STORY 2</p>

<p></p>

<p><span><strong><u>The Neolibertarian Network Has Arrived</u></strong></span></p>

<p>I don't know about YOU, but I've always wanted to be a Libertarian except that I always felt that <em>Libertarians</em> were sort of like <em>Liberals</em> in that they had lofty and admirable notions that were largely inapplicable to the exigencies of day-to-day life. The Neolibertarian Movement has settled that issue, and I'M SIGNING UP!</p>

<p>What's a <a href="http://www.qando.net/Details.aspx?Entry=1330">neolibertarian</a><a href="http://www.qando.net/Details.aspx?Entry=1330">?</a> I don't want to spoil it for you but it just may be a more workable form of a political philosophy that is, at its roots, highly attractive. The <a href="http://www.qando.net/">QandO Blog</a>&nbsp; is the place for you to click it out.</p>

<p><span><strong><u>A Blog Of Note and To Be Noted:</u></strong></span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.theglitteringeye.com/">The Glittering Eye</a> should get YOUR eye every day. It's author lists interesting items throughout the Internet on a daily (or more) basis which serves as a jumping point for like-minded readers.</p>

<p>But TGE's Dave Schuler doesn't stop there... he adds his own analysis as in this trenchant piece on the evolution of <a href="http://www.theglitteringeye.com/archives/000867.html">Soviet containment policy in the era of George Kennan.</a></p>

<p>And you MUST check out his coverage of the Iditarod -- because it is <strong><em>SO</em></strong> cool.</p>

<p></p>

<p><span><strong><u>My Med Buds</u></strong></span></p>

<p>Since this is MY HOUSE, I'm going to <em>use</em> the rules a little and introduce you to my family and friends in the medical blogosphere. We are <em>really</em> good, and you can get yourself clean here. It's information you need, and there is a lot of it by&nbsp; experienced physicians, nurses, techs, students, and more.</p>

<p>Nick at <a href="http://blogborygmi.blogspot.com/">Blogborygmi</a> gets poetic, no <a href="http://blogborygmi.blogspot.com/2005/03/i-sing-body-electric.html">Whitmanesque while expatiating</a> about the new RedTacton technology -- devices that purportedly will transmit data over people's natural electric fields. Dare I say ecstatic?</p>

<p>Another of my compeers, Dr. Charles, blogs regularly at <a href="http://drcharles.blogspot.com/">The Examining Room of Doctor Charles</a>. He takes an interesting trip from a colorblind patient to an evolutionary proposition. This is the result of having an inquisitive and divergent mind. Read <a href="http://drcharles.blogspot.com/2005/03/color-of-ones-life.html">The Color of One's Life.</a></p>

<p>New med blogs crop up every week. I have trouble keeping up nowadays, mainly because I feel like I'm juggling twelve Faberge Eggs every day...but, seriously, there have been a couple of great new med blogs you just GOT&nbsp; to visit. One of these is <a href="http://drtony.blogspot.com/">Dr. Tony</a>, and his recent humerus post about <a href="http://drtony.blogspot.com/2005/03/paul-was-enterprising-platelet.html">an &quot;enterprising&quot; platelet</a> is not only funny, it's instructive.</p>

<p>DO NOT miss <a href="http://effectmeasure.blogspot.com/">Effect Measure</a>, an IMPORTANT&nbsp; medical blog with <em>cutting-edge posts about bird flu (you MUST follow this story).</em></p>

<p><a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/">Respectful Insolence</a>&nbsp; (a.k.a. &quot;Orac Knows&quot;) is a physic an with consistently worthwhile posts, who recently wrote a four part series about <a href="http://oracknows.blogspot.com/2005/03/deadly-power-of-denial-part-4-denial.html">the deadly power of denial</a>, concluding with the denial that occurs in the treating physician. Read Orac.</p>

<p>I check in with <a href="http://www.kevinmd.com/blog/">Kevin, M.D</a>. every day for his slant on the news, and to <a href="http://rangelmd.com/">RangelMD</a> for his thorough, intelligent blogging. Then there are the Senators and Voices of Reason (helping to balance out CodeBlueBlog): <a href="http://www.medrants.com/index.php">DB's Medical Rants</a> and&nbsp; <a href="http://medpundit.blogspot.com/">Medpundit</a>. </p>

<p>The studs in the ER and OR are <a href="http://gruntdoc.com/">Grunt Doc</a> and <a href="http://www.cut-to-cure.blogspot.com/">Bard Parker</a> -- go see, if you have the stomach...</p>

<p>I would be remiss if I didn't mention <a href="http://medicalmadhouse.blogspot.com/">The Mad House Madman</a>, for whom we all have love. There's a new being in his life, so his blogging is currently...colicky.</p>

<p><span><strong><u>Terri Schiavo</u></strong></span></p>

<p>My Carnival would not have been complete without <a href="http://www.classicalvalues.com/">Eric Scheie of Classical Values</a> sending me a post. Thanks, Eric. <strong>BOOK MARK HIS SITE</strong>. It is always good, and contains TONS of info. I once asked Eric where he found the time to think and write into his blog as much as he does (as I labor past 2 AM Tuesday night!)...and he emailed me: &quot;My loss is your gain. lol&quot;</p>

<p>He's right! <em>This</em> is what the blogosphere is all about. FREE stuff in great proportions. Read what Eric has to say about the Terri Schiavo case in <a href="http://www.classicalvalues.com/archives/002132.html">Politicized to Death</a>.</p>

<p>It's all about drawing lines, isn't it? <a href="http://www.rightwingnuthouse.com/">Rightwing Nuthouse</a> is good. And there is <a href="http://rightwingnuthouse.com/archives/2005/03/19/the-slippery-slope-groningen-and-terri/">an important point made</a> about how the very act of repetition inures one to the initial repugnance of that act. Read it. </p>

<p>I just recently found <a href="http://s88251339.onlinehome.us/smartercop/">The Smarter Cop</a>, and IT'S GOOD. Read <a href="http://s88251339.onlinehome.us/smartercop/archives/003034.html">this</a> exquisite analogy that ties itself to Terri Schiavo. Well done.</p>

<p>I respect and admire P.Z. Myers -- <a href="http://pharyngula.org/">of Pharyngula</a> -- and any time he has something to say, I listen and I take him seriously. He's good. He's passionate. His blog rocks. He references H.P. Lovecraft --&nbsp; one of my first big fiction obsessions. P.Z. steps back in the Schiavo case to express what I take as his exasperation. <a href="http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/">A Lovecraftian auditory phenomenon</a> expresses all that.</p>

<p><a href="http://blue-state-red.blogspot.com/">BlueStateRed </a>cogently addresses what many are thinking and saying: that despite the exigencies of the Schiavo case, the intervening of Congress and the President are in many ways baffling, and perhaps, even a poor gambit. Steven M. Couch places blames on all parties in this NEAT little piece that <a href="http://blue-state-red.blogspot.com/2005/03/hard-cases-make-bad-law.html">responds to the insufferable Peggy Noonan</a>. Bookmark this blog.</p>

<p>The last upcoming comments on Terri are sublime and for some reason recall, for me, T.S.Eliot in Four Quartets:</p><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><blockquote dir="ltr"><p><strong>Garlic and sapphires in the mud</strong></p>

<p><strong>Clot the bedded axle-tree</strong></p>

<p><strong>The trilling wire in the blood</strong></p>

<p><strong>Sings below inveterate scars</strong></p>

<p><strong>Appeasing long forgotten wars.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The dance along the artery</strong></p>

<p><strong>The circulation of the lymph</strong></p>

<p><strong>Are figured in the drift of stars</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ascend to summer in the tree</strong></p>

<p><strong>We move above the moving trees</strong></p>

<p><strong>And hear upon the sodden floor</strong></p>

<p><strong>Below, the boarhound and the boar</strong></p>

<p>I stopped videotaping obstetrical ultrasounds for parents over ten years ago when I realized that I was setting myself up for a fall (and I saw it happen, subsequently to other Docs) because I like to try to <em>think like a Torter (*snap* *snap*)</em> in order to avoid their snapping beaks. <a href="http://www.punditguy.com/">PUNDITGUY</a> sees this phenomenon now in videotaping of births, and he is RIGHT ON with his analysis of the implications.&nbsp; A must read is <a href="http://www.punditguy.com/2005/03/stop_the_tape.html">Stop The Tape!</a></p>
