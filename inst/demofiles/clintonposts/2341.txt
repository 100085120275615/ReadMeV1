<span>According to Senator Hillary Clinton, the House of Representatives is a plantation.  Now I'll beat Hillary Clinton at her own game.  I'll give her a dose of her own medicine...</span>
<br />
<ul>
<li>"The American economy will be your plantation of tax revenue Senator Clinton, if the American people make the mistake of voting for you."</li>
<li>"The hallways (or railroads) which lead to the oval office were certainly not underground."</li>
</ul>
<span>[The two previous statements are completely absurd and I do not agree with them or anything they might imply (which is absolutely nothing)]  Except that Hillary will tax the living hell out of me if elected.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>Let's make an agreement Hillary.  In the future Senator Clinton, let's both rise above using slavery (which was obvioulsy terrible and obviously happened over a century ago) as a political slingshot.  I won't if you won't.</span>
