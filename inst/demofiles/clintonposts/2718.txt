<div><p>I blame the <a href="http://joesschool.blogs.com/olsononline/2006/08/a_different_per.html#comments">less than favorable comments</a> I received on my last Israel-Hezbollah post --I side <strong>with</strong> the &quot;terrorists&quot;-- on the Israel lobby.&nbsp; Even smart poiticians like Hillary Clinton have swallowed the Zionist message that Israel, whatever its actions, is ever &quot;virtuous&quot;, and its Arab enemies always &quot;terrorists&quot;. </p>

<p>The truth, as always, is more subtle.&nbsp; Israeli military historian Uri Avnery blames the current debacle in Lebanon on the<a href="http://www.antiwar.com/avnery/?articleid=9534"> leaders of the Israeli Defense Force</a> for misreading the &quot;enemy&quot;:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>The common denominator of all the failures is the <strong>disdain for Arabs</strong>, a contempt that has dire consequences. It has caused total misunderstanding, a kind of <strong>blindness</strong> of Hezbollah's motives, attitudes, 
&nbsp; standing in Lebanese society, etc.</em>&quot;</p></blockquote><p>His larger point is that in the militarization of Israeli society, the IDF has become a dominant player, a <a href="http://www.lrb.co.uk/v28/n16/laor01_.html">view shared by Israeli writer Yitzhak Laor</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;He writes that the IDF has become immune from criticism by domestic critics:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>The IDF is the most <strong>powerful institution</strong> in Israeli society, and one
which we are discouraged from criticising. Few have studied the
dominant role it plays in the Israeli economy. Even while they are
still serving, our generals become friendly with the US companies that
sell arms to Israel; they then retire, loaded with money, and become
corporate executives. The IDF is the biggest customer for everything
and anything in Israel</em>.&quot;</p></blockquote><p>But that doesn't explain the pro-Israel fervor among Americans, including celebrity opinion makers like CNN's Wolf Blitzer and the woefully overmatched <strong>Anderson Cooper</strong>. [In an interview with the <em>New Yorker's</em> Jeffrey Goldberg, Cooper is said by <a href="http://www.bitterlemons-international.org/inside.php?id=590">Max Hastings&nbsp; to have compared</a> Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah with <strong>Adolf Hitler</strong>.]&nbsp; </p>

<p>The 'Zionization' of American public opinion can only be explained, says <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/bricmont08122006.html">Jean Bricmont in this penetrating analysis</a>, by the power of the Israeli lobby in America.&nbsp; That power derives from a combination of the Israeli lobby's selective funding of political candidates, it's playing of the anti-semitism card, and it's promotion of a world view --&quot;<em>accepted too easily by too many Americans</em>&quot;<span>--</span> that American and Israeli values are identical.&nbsp; And that leads to a negative perception of Arabs:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em>Associated with this identification comes a systematically <strong>hostile</strong> view of the <strong>Arab</strong> and <strong>Muslim world</strong>, which both increases the lobby's effectiveness and is in part the result of its propaganda. Despite all the talk about anti-racism and &quot;political correctness&quot;, there is an almost total lack of understanding of the <strong>Arab viewpoint on Palestine</strong>, and, in particular, of the racist nature of the problem</em><span>.&quot;</span></p></blockquote><p>The most influential dupe of the Israeli lobby is, unfortunately, George W. Bush, the Commander-in-Chief of the increasingly militaristic American state.&nbsp; Bush's simple-minded predisposition to <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/views06/0814-24.htm">believe in a global &quot;Islamist threat&quot;</a> leaves him with few alternatives other than to side with Israel against the Arabs.&nbsp; And that does not bode well for the future of peace in the Middle East:</p><blockquote><p>&quot;<em><span>The <strong>madness</strong> of
Bush's policy is that he has made a wilful choice to amalgamate the
grossly irrational, totalitarian and homicidal objectives of al-Qaida
with the just claims of Palestinians and grievances of Iraqis. His
remarks on Saturday invite Muslims who sympathise with Hamas or reject
Iraq's occupation or merely aspire to grow opium in Afghanistan to make
common cause with Bin Laden.
</span></em></p>

<p><em>&quot;If
the United States <strong>insists</strong> upon regarding all Muslim opponents of its
foreign policies as a <strong>homogeneous</strong> enemy then that is what <strong>they become</strong>.
The Muslim radicals' 'single narrative' portrays the entire course of
history as a Christian and Jewish plot against Islam.</em>&quot;<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
