<p>Itâs no secret that Iâve been a Joe Lieberman-hater for most of his 18 years as my Senator. Indeed, one of the proudest moments of my life happened when he crashed one of my Head Start events, saw my nametag, and looked over his shoulder to see if his security showed up. Therefore, it will not come as a shock that his defeat warmed the cockles of my heart.</p>

<p>Joe tried to paint Ned Lamont as a one-issue candidate. That wasnât the case â the Democratic electorate didnât care for Joeâs lack of attention to local concerns, and for some reason Democrats were equally concerned about his unproductive closeness to the president. But as it turns out, it would have been more than enough.</p>

<p>According to exit polling, three out of four people who voted in the primary were opposed to the war. This will have a major impact upon those running in November all across the nation. It is not good news for Republicans, and it is not good news for the dickless Democrats â in other words, nearly all of âem.</p>

<p>Joe lost by more than 10,000 votes, and that doesnât count the record-setting number of absentee voters. And thatâs despite a last minute surge of Republican and independent pro-war crossover voters that ate into Nedâs 13 point lead. The pollsters only polled Democrats, which shows up the fault of the process.</p>

<p>Joe filed as an independent candidate. So why do I say the witch is dead? After all, the same polls that gave Joe the 13 point lead said Joe would win in a three way race against Ned.</p>

<p>Well, for one thing, Connecticut is a blue state, the Republican candidate doesnât even have the support of the Republican party (last month they tried to talk him into quitting the race), and the heavy-hitter Democrats like Chris Dodd, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Clinton who supported Lieberman in the primary were tripping over each other to make good on their promise to support the winner of that primary. Typically and hypocritically, Hillary already started damage control last week.</p>

<p>But, most important, Joe Lieberman is a three-time loser. He lost (effectively) the 2000 vice-presidental race. In fact, he had so little confidence in Al Gore that he simultaneously ran for reelection to the senate, which all of a sudden doesnât sit well with Connecticut Democrats. He ran for president in 2004 and couldnât even make that âthree-way tie for third placeâ he bragged about. And now he couldnât even get his own partyâs nomination for another term. That almost <i>never</i> happens.</p>

<p>Come November, Ned Lamont will become Connecticutâs next senator.</p>
