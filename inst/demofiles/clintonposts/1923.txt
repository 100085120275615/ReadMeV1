<br />KENNETT, MISSOURI -Shocking pictures surfaced today of Presidential hopeful, Steven Holsten that again raised the Pedo issue. It was only last week that Holsten announced his intention to run for the presidency in 2008 on the NAMBLA ticket, with an yet to be announced running mate. Some are asking, "Is it 2004 all over again?" In the 2004 debacle Holsten was jailed in what he claims to have been a political move by rival George W. Bush for exposing himself to a minor (Holsten was cleared of all charges following the election). It was the second major set back for Holsten, in as many weeks, a fire the week before destroyed the Holsten family trailer. The latest set back has even close family members doubting Steve. Shirley Holsten issued this statement from the ashes of their once proud white trash home: "I told the stupid shit, not to run."<br />
<br />Steve Holsten however remained seemingly unfazed and issued this statement "I knew those nigger dick suckers would try something like this. It is obviously the work of my political opponents, either Hillary, Ruby, or DirecTV. Did they realize they were fucking faggots before<br />or after they put the dick in their mouths?"<a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/7133/2056/1600/capt.jpg">

</a>Hillary Clinton issued the following statement following the Holsten statement, "Who is this stupid fuck, again?" Rudy Giulani, Republican front running on the other hand had the following comment, "He said I am what? Look, I'm from New York. We don't take that kind of shit. I'm going to come down to Missouri and kick his fat crippled ass." DirecTV had no comment, but was quick to point out: "What goes around, comes around.The little bitch, better pay us our money." Many will recall that Holsten was involved in a legal battle with DirecTV and owes them over $10,000 dollars.<br />
