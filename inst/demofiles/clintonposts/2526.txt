<div>- <a href="http://onlineathens.com/stories/082806/news_20060828032.shtml">Good story on the effect downtown will have on the upcoming local races</a>, or more specifically, how student drinking will impact the election. I tend to think much of this whole 'there's a problem downtown' thing is a bit overblown. The <i>Athens Banner-Herald</i> says there were 71 alcohol-related offenses two weekends ago. Considering we've got more than 30,000 students, that's .002 percent. If you break it down further, estimating you have anywhere from 2,500 to 3,000 students downtown on a given weekend night, that's two percent of the downtown population acting up. So <i>two percent</i> acts the fool, and everyone is up in arms? And current commissioner and mayoral candidate Tom Chasteen, doing everything he can to make me not vote for him, wants to move closing time up to 2 a.m. ... which will only cause students to drink <i>more</i> in a shorter period of time, potentially worsening the problem rather than helping it.<br />
<br />- Awesome! <a href="http://onlineathens.com/stories/082806/letters_20060828004.shtml">Rival College Republicans duke it out</a> and fight over who's a bigger victim ... my conservative group or yours?<br />
<br />- Supporters of both Doug McKillip and E.H. Culpepper <a href="http://athenspolitics.blogspot.com/2006/08/culpepper-campaign-responds.html">continue to slug it out at Athens Politics</a>.<br />
<br />- Apparently, <a href="http://onlineathens.com/stories/082806/news_20060828034.shtml">parents don't care and the kids hate shuffling paperwork to and fro</a>. On an aside, Carrie Olsen, Madison County High School's faculty adviser to the Gay/Straight Alliance, is confusing me ...<br />
<br />
<i>She's not sure how large the club will be this year because the club will meet for the first time next month, but at a club fair at the beginning of the year, only about 30 students signed up to receive more information.<br />
<br />"Well, we had less people sign up," Olson said. "But we didn't have that many people at the beginning of last year. And this year, we're charging dues."</i>
<br />
<br />You're <i>disappointed</i> 30 kids signed up for this ... <i>in Madison County</i>? Dude, if I were you, I'd be doing cartwheels.<br />
<br />- To make myself feel older, I compiled a <a href="http://safeashouses.blogspot.com/2006/08/dating-myself.html">list of my musical tastes from the early- and mid-1990s for my interns</a>. Please note inclusion of Rob Base.<br />
<br />- Another thing about downtown ... there's all this talk of trash and the smell, and I think that as well is overhyped. The Wife go to church downtown on Sunday mornings, and everything is put back together ... and it isn't as if the kids are <i>that</i> bad. The city workers who come out in the wee morning hours deserve our respect and our thanks for doing a bang-up job in cleaning up our streets. It's a thankless task, but one we as a community should appreciate much more.<br />
<br />- <a href="http://antidisingenuous.blogspot.com">Hillary</a> and her husband <a href="http://antidisingenuous.blogspot.com/2006_08_01_antidisingenuous_archive.html#115660299145750565">celebrated their 10th anniversary</a>, and I couldn't make it to the shindig. So my apologies for that, and another Happy Anniversary wish to them.<br />
<br />- The Wife has returned from her five-day visit to Houston to see our twin nephews, meaning I don't have the bed all to myself any more. You take for granted how nice it is to spread out in the center of a queen-sized bed until, you know, you can't. Still, she's The Wife and it's good to have her back home.<br />
<br />- I'm glad <a href="http://www.redandblack.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/08/28/44f23e43641bc">this kid is such a dedicated worker</a>, and he'll no doubt go far in life, but <i>tons of students</i> do this kind of thing, just in areas that are different than politics. I worked 30 hours a week, usually more, as a beat writer at the <i>Banner-Herald</i> during my senior year. My boy Hartman worked a full-time gig for NewsChannel 32. It's life. It happens.</div>
