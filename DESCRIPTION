Description: The ReadMe software package for R takes as input a set of text
    documents (such as speeches, blog posts, newspaper articles, judicial
    opinions, movie reviews, etc.), a categorization scheme chosen by the
    user (e.g., ordered positive to negative sentiment ratings, unordered
    policy topics, or any other mutually exclusive and exhaustive set of
    categories), and a small subset of text documents hand classified into
    the given categories. If used properly, ReadMe will report,
    within sampling error of the truth, the proportion of documents within
    each of the given categories among those not hand coded. ReadMe
    computes the distribution within categories without the more error
    prone intermediate step of classifying individual documents. Various
    other procedures are included to make processing text easy.
